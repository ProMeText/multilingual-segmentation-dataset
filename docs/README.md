# 📚 Documentation – Multilingual Segmentation Dataset

This `docs/` folder contains the full documentation for the **Multilingual Segmentation Dataset**,  
designed to support clarity, reproducibility, and transparency in its construction and usage.

The dataset includes a curated, linguistically informed collection of **raw and segmented excerpts** drawn from historical literary works in multiple medieval languages, primarily Romance.

It supports tasks such as:

- ✂️ Sentence segmentation  
- 📜 Historical linguistic analysis  
- 🌍 Cross-linguistic and diachronic comparison of medieval texts  

The documentation outlines segmentation principles, data structures, heuristics, and metadata sources used to compile the corpus.

## 📁 `data/` Folder Structure

Each subcorpus (e.g. `lancelot/`, `Multilingual_Aegidius/`) includes its own `raw/` and `segmented/` directories.

### `raw/`  
📄 **Cleaned, unsegmented texts**  
- UTF-8 encoded, markup removed  
- Original orthography, punctuation, and spacing preserved  
- No segmentation applied

### `pre_split/`  
🧾 **Manually or heuristically segmented excerpts**  
- Extracted from `raw/`  
- Marked with `£` for sentence/segment boundaries  
- Available in `.txt` format

### `split/`  
🔀 **Machine learning partitions**  
- Train/dev/test sets  
- In both `.txt` and `.json`  
- Organized by language (`ca/`, `fr/`, etc.) or multilingual folders

## 🧭 How to Use This Documentation

- **Researchers**: reproduce or extend the dataset using segmentation guidelines  
- **Annotators**: follow language-specific segmentation criteria  
- **Developers**: integrate the dataset into NLP pipelines with the documented structure
