Be Mercurius flovte we may vnderstond £þat þe goode sperit be not disseyvid £by þe hold enemy trowe £ony mysbeleve of þe feyth £or othir wyse £than he shuld beleue stedefastly £þe Article þat Seynt Matheu þe Euangelist seith, £þat God shall come and iuge þe qweke £and the dede, £where he seith, £"Inde venturus iudicare vivos £et mortuos". 
Þerfore now no þing of dampnacion is to hem £þat ben in Crist Jhesu, £wich wandren not aftir þe fleiȝss. £For þe lawe of þe spiritt £of lijf in Crist Jhesu haþ delyuerid me £fro þe lawe of synne, £and of deeþ.£For þat þat was vnpossible to þe lawe, £in what þing it was seek bi fleiȝss, £God sente his sone in to þe liknesse of fleiȝssh of synne, £and of synne dampnede synne in fleiȝss; £þat þe iustifijng of þe lawe £were fulfild in vs, £þat goon not aftir þe fleiȝss, £but aftir þe spiritt. £For þei þat ben aftir þe fleiȝss, £saueren þo þingis £þat ben of þe fleȝss; £but þei þat ben aftir þe spiritt, £felen þo þingis þat ben of þe spiritt.
For þe prudence of fleiȝss is deeþ, £but þe prudence of spiritt is lijf and pees. £For þe wisdam of þe fleiȝss £is enemy to God; £for it is not sogett to þe lawe of God, £for neþer it may.£And þei þat ben in fleiȝss, £mow not pleese to God. £But ȝe ben not in fleiȝss, £but in spiritt, £if neþeles þe spiritt of God duelliþ in ȝou.
But if any haþ not þe spiritt of Crist, £þis is not his. £For if Crist is in ȝou, £þe bodi is deed fro synne, £but þe spiritt lifeþ £for iustifijng.
And if þe spiritt of him £þat reiside Jhesu Crist fro deeþ£duelleþ in ȝou, £he þat reisede Jhesu Crist £from deeþ shal quykene £also ȝoure deede bodies, £for þe spiritt of him þat duelliþ in ȝou. £Þerfore, breþern, we ben dettours, £not to þe fleiȝss £þat we lifen aftir þe fleiȝss.£For if ȝe lifen £aftir þe fleiȝss, £ȝe shule dye; £but if ȝe bi þe spiritt sleen £þe dedis of fleiȝss, £ȝe shulen life. 
£For who euere ben ladde £bi þe spiritt of God, £þes ben þe sones of God. £For ȝe han not take eftsone þe spiritt £of seruage in drede, £but ȝe han taken þe spiritt £of adopcion of sones, £in wiche we crien, £And þe þilke spiritt ȝeldeþ wittnessing £to oure spiritt, £þat we ben þe sones of God; £if sones, and eiris, £and eiris of God, £and eiris togidere wiþ Crist; £if neþeles we suffren togidere, £þat also we ben glorified togidere. 
£And I deme þat þe passions of þis tyme £ben not worþi £to þe glorie to comynge £þat shal be shewid in vs. £For þe abiding of creature £abideþ þe shewing of þe sones of God. £But þe creature is sogett £to vanytee, £not willinge, £but for him £þat made it sogett in hope; £for þe ilke creature shal be delyuerid £fro seruage of corrupcion £in to liberte of þe glorie £of þe sones of God.
And we witen £þat ech creature sorowiþ and traueliþ £wiþ peyne til yit.
And not oonli it, £but also we vs self, £þat han þe firste fruyȝtis £of þe spiritt, £and we vs self sorewen wiþ inne vs £for þe adopcion of Goddes sones, £abiding þe aȝenbijng of oure bodi.
But bi hope £we ben made saaf.
For hope þat is sein, £is not hope; £for who hopeþ þat þing, £þat he seeþ? £And if we hopen þat þing £þat we seen not, £we abiden bi pacience.
And also þe spiritt £helpeþ oure infirmite; £for what we shulen preie, £as it bihoueþ, we witen not, £but þilke spiritt axiþ £for vs wiþ sorowingis þat moun not be toolde out. £For he þat sekiþ þe hertis, £whot what þe spiritt desireþ, £for bi God he axiþ £for holie men. £And we witen, £þat to men þat louen God, £alle þingis worchen togidere in to good, £to hem þat aftir purpos ben clepide seintis. £For þilke þat he knew bifore, £he bifore ordeynede bi grace £to be maad lijk to þe ymage £of his sone, £þat he be þe firste bigoten £among manye briþern.
And þilke þat he bifore ordeynede to blis, £hem he clepide; £and wiche he clepide, £hem he iustifiede; £and wich he iustifiede, £and hem he gloriede.
What þanne shulen we seie to þes þingis? £If God for vs, £who is aȝens vs? £Þe wich also sparide £not his owne sone, £but for vs alle bitook him, £how also ȝaf he not to vs alle þingis wiþ him? £Who shal accuse aȝens þe chosen men of God? £It is God þat iustifieþ. £Who is it þat condempneþ? £It is Jhesus Crist £þat was deed, ȝhe, £þe wiche roos aȝen, £þe wiche is on þe riȝt half of God, £and þe wiche preieþ for vs. £Who þanne shal departe vs £fro þe charite of Crist? 
Tribulacion, or angwiȝss, or hungir, or nakidnesse, or persecucion, or perel, or swerd? £As it is writen, £For we ben slayne al dai for þee, £we ben gessid as sheep of slauȝter. £But in alle þes þingis we ouercomen, £for him þat louede vs. 
But I am certein, £þat neþer deeþ, £neþer lijf, £neþer aungels, £neþir principatus, £neþer vertues, £neþer present þingis, £neþer þingis to comynge, £neþer strengþe, £neþer heiȝte,£neþer depnesse,£neþer noon oþer creature £mai departe vs £fro þe charite of God, £þat is in Crist Jhesu oure Lord. £Y seie treuþe in Crist Jhesu, £Y lie not, £for my conscience beriþ wittnessing to me £in þe Holi Goost, £for greet heuynesse is to me, £and contynuel sorewe to my herte. £For I my self desirede £to be departid fro Crist for my breþern, 
þat ben my cosyns aftir þe fleiȝss, £þat ben men of Israel; £whos is adopcion of sones, £and glorie, and testament, £and ȝifing of þe lawe, £and seruise, and bihestis; £whos ben þe fadris, £and of wiche is Crist £aftir þe fleiȝss, £þat is God aboue alle þingis, £blessid in to worldis. Amen.
But not þat þe word of God £haþ fallen doun.
For not alle £þat ben of Israel, £þes ben Israelitis. £Neþer þei þat ben seed of Abraham, £alle ben sones, £but in Isaac þe seed £shal be clepid to þee.
Þat is to seie, £not þei þat ben sones £of þe fleiȝss, £ben sones of God, £but þei þat ben sones£of biheest ben demed in þe seed. £For whi þis is þe word of biheest, £Aftir þis tyme shal I come, £and a sone shal be to Sare.
And not oonli she, £but also Rebecca hadde twei sones £of oon liȝgging bi of Isaac, £oure fadir.
And whanne þei weren not ȝit borne, £neþer hadden doo £any þing of good eþer of yuel, £þat þe purpos of God £shulde duelle £bi eleccion, £not of werkis, £but of God clepinge, £it was seid to him, £Þat þe more shulde serue þe lasse, £as it is writen, £I louede Jacob, £but I hatide Esau. £What þerfore shulen we seie? £Wheþer wickidnesse £be anentis God? £God forbede. £For he seiþ to Moises, £Y shal haue merci £on whom I shal haue mercy, £and I shal ȝife merci £on whom I shal haue merci. £Þerfore it is not neþer £of man willinge, £neþir rennyng, £but of God hauynge merci.
And þe scripture seiþ to Farao, £For to þis þing £I haue stired þee, £þat I shewe in þee my vertu, £and þat my name be toold £in al erþe. £Þerfore of whom God wole, £he haþ merci, £and whom he wole, he endureþ. £Þanne seist þou to me, £What is souȝt ȝit? £For who wiþstondeþ his wille? £O man, whoo art þou, £þat answerist to God? £Wher a maad þing seiþ to him £þat made it, £What hast þou maad me so? £Wheþer a potter of clei £haþ not power £to make of þe same gobett oo vessel £in to onour, £anoþer in to dispijt? 
Þat if God willinge £to shewe his wraþþe, £and to make his power knowen, £haþ suffrid in gret pacience vessels of wraþþe £able in to deþ, £to shewe þe riȝcchessis £of his glorie in to vessels of merci, £wiche he made redie in to glorie. £Wiche also he clepide not oneli of Jewis, £but also of heþene men, £as he seiþ in Osee, £I shal clepe not my puple my puple, £and not my louede my louede, £and not getinge merci geting merci; £and it shal be in þe place, £where it is seid to hem, £Not ȝe my puple, £þere þei shulen be clepid £þe sones of God lifinge. £But Isaie crieþ for Israel, £If þe noumbre of Israel shal be £as þe grauele of þe see, £þe relifes shulen be made safe.
Forsoþe a word makinge an ende, £and abreȝgginge in equyte, £for þe Lord shal make £a word breȝggid on al erþe. £And as Isaie bifore seide, £But God of oostis hadde laft £to vs seed, £we hadden be maad as Sodom, £and we hadden be lijk as Gomor. £Þerfore what shulen we seie? £Þat heþene men £þat sueden not riȝtwesnesse, £han geten riȝtwesnesse, ȝhe, £þe riȝtwesnesse þat is of feiþ.
But Israel suynge þe lawe of riȝtwesnesse, £cam not parfittli £in to þe lawe of riȝtwesnesse. £Whi? For not of feiþ, £but as of werkis. £And þei spurneden £aȝens þe stoon of offencion, £as it is writen, Lo! £I putte a stoon of offencion in Sion, £and a stoon of sclaundre; £and ech þat shal bileue in it, £shal not be confoundid. £Breþern, þe wille of my herte £and my biseching £is maad to God £for hem in to helþe.  £But I bere wittnessing to hem, £þat þei han loue of God, £but not aftir kunnyng.  £For þei vnknowing Goddis riȝtwesnesse, £and sekinge to make stidefast her owne riȝtfulnesse, £ben not sogett to þe riȝtwesnesse of God.  £For þe eende of þe lawe is Crist, £to riȝtwesnesse to eche man þat bileueþ.  £For Moises wroot, £For þe man £þat shal do riȝtwesnesse £þat is of þe lawe, £shal life in it.
But þe riȝtwesnesse £þat is of bileue, £seiþ þus, £Seie þou not in þi herte, £Who shal stie in to heuene? £(þat is to seie, £to leede doun Crist), £or who shal go doun in to helle? £(þat is, to aȝenclepe Crist £fro deeþ).  £But what seiþ þe scripture? £Þe word is niȝ in þi mouþ, £and in þi herte; £þis is þe word of bileue, £wiche we prechen.  £Þat if þou knowlechist £in þi mouþ þe Lord Jhesu Crist, £and bileuest in þi herte, £þat God reiside him fro deeþ, £þou shalt be saaf.  £For bi herte me bileueþ to riȝtwesnesse, £but bi mouþ knowleching £is maad to heelþe.  £For whi þe scripture seiþ, £Eche þat bileueþ to in him, £shal not be confoundid.  £And þer is no distinccion £of Jew and of Greke; £for þe same Lord £of alle is riche in alle, £þat inwardli clepen him.
For eche man who euere shal inwardli £clepe þe name of þe Lord, £shal be saaf.  £How þanne shulen þei inwardli clepe him, £in to whom þei han not bileued? £Or hou shulen þei bileue to him, £whom þei han not herd? £Hou shulen þei here, £wiþ oute a prechour? £And hou shulen þei preche, £but þei be sent? £As it is writen, £Hou feire ben þe feet £of hem þat prechen pees, £of hem þat prechen goode þingis.  £But not alle men obeien to þe gospel.
For Isaie seiþ, £Lord, who bileuede to oure heering? £Þerfore feiþ is of heering, £but heering bi þe word of Crist. £Here begynnyth a schort tretys £and a comfortabyl for synful wrecchys, £wherin thei may have gret solas £and comfort to hem £and undyrstondyn the hy £and unspecabyl mercy £of ower sovereyn Savyowr Cryst Jhesu, £whos name be worschepd and magnyfyed £wythowten ende, £that now in ower days to us unworthy deyneth £to exercysen hys nobeley and hys goodnesse.
Alle the werkys of ower Saviowr ben £for ower exampyl and instruccyon, £and what grace £that he werkyth £in any creatur is ower profyth £yf lak of charyté be not ower hynderawnce.
And therfor, be the leve of ower mercyful Lord Cryst Jhesu, £to the magnyfying of hys holy name, £Jhesu, this lytyl tretys schal tretyn sumdeel £in parcel of hys wonderful werkys, £how mercyfully, how benyngly, £and how charytefully he meved and stered £a synful caytyf unto hys love, £whech synful caytyf many yerys was in wyl £and in purpose thorw steryng of the Holy Gost £to folwyn oure Savyour, £makyng gret behestys of fastyngys £wyth many other dedys of penawns.
And evyr sche was turned agen abak £in tym of temptacyon, £lech unto the reedspyr £whech boweth wyth every wynd £and nevyr is stable £les than no wynd bloweth, £unto the tyme £that ower mercyfulle Lord Cryst Jhesu £havyng pety and compassyon £of hys handwerke £and hys creatur turnyd helth into sekenesse, £prosperyté into adversyté, £worshep into repref, £and love into hatered. £Thus alle this thyngys turnyng up so down, £this creatur whych many yerys had gon wyl £and evyr ben unstable was parfythly drawen £and steryd to entren the wey of hy perfeccyon, £whech parfyth wey Cryst ower Savyowr £in hys propyr persoone examplyd. 
Sadly he trad it £and dewly he went it beforn. £Than this creatur, £of whom thys tretys thorw the mercy of Jhesu £schal schewen in party the levyng, £towched be the hand of owyr Lord £wyth grett bodyly sekenesse, £wher thorw sche lost reson £and her wyttes a long tym £tyl ower Lord be grace restoryd her ageyn, £as it schal mor openly be schewed aftyrward. £Her werdly goodys, £whech wer plentyuows and abundawnt £at that day, £in lytyl whyle after wer ful bareyn and bare.

And that londe £He had y-chose bifore all other londes £as the most vertuous £and most worthi of the world. £And therfore seith the philosofre thus: £virtus rerum inmedio consistit. £That is to say: £"vertu of thynges is in the myddel." £And in that londe He wolde lede His liff £and suffre passion £and deth of Jewes £for to bigge us and delivereus£fro paynes of Hell and deth withouten eynde, £which was ordeyned to us for synne £of oure forme fader Adam £and for oure owen synnes also. 
As for Hymselfnought, £for He hadde noon yvel deserved, £for He dide never yll. £And He that waskyng of joye, £He myght best in that place suffre deth. £For whoso wole do eny thyng £for the which he wole be knowe opynli, £he wole do hit crie opynli £in the myddelplace of a cité other of a toune, £so that hit may be knowe £to all parties of that cité £other of that toune. £So dide He that was kyng of the worlde. 
He wolde suffre dethat Jerusalem, £that is in the middel of the worlde, £so that hit myght be knowe to men £of all parties of the worlde £how dire He bought man £that He made to His licknys£for the gret love £that He hadde to us. £For more worthy catel £myght nought besette for us £than His blessid body £and His precious blood £which He offred for us. 
Lo, dere God, £what love He hadde £to His sogettes, £when He that hadde don notrespas, £only for oure trespas suffred deth. £Ryght wel ought men to love £and dredeand worshippe soche a lord, £and preise soch a lond so holy £that brought forth socha fruyt, £thorgh which every man is saved £but hit be his owene defaute. £This is thelond that longeth £to oure heritage. £And in that lond £He wolde deyghe £and seysed to leve hit £to His children. 
For which every good Cristen man £that hath wherofsholde streynth hem £for to conquere oure ryght heritage £and chace away the myssetrewantes. £For we beth called Cristen men £of Crist Oure Fader. £And if webe right children of Crist £we aughte then £to chalenge the righte heritage of OureFader £and put hit £out of strange men hondes. £But now pryde, covetise, and envye £hath enflammed the herte of lordes of theworlde, £that they bien more bisy £forto deserte her neyghbores £than to chalangeand conquere £here ryght heritage biforeseyd. £And comyn peple £that wolde puthere body and catel £to conquere oure heritage may nought do £withoute lordes. 
Forasemblé of comyn peple £withoute a chief lorde beth £as a flock of sheep £that hathno shephurd, £which they parteth asoundre £and woot nought whyder to go. £Butwolde God that wordli lordis £were of good acoord and eche of hem other £and alsocomune peple £that they wolde take this holy viage over the see. £I trowe thenwithynne a litel £while oure right heritage forsayde £sholde be reconsiled £and y-puttein handes £of the right eyres of Jhesu Crist. 
And for as moch as men desireth £to hyre speke of the Holy Lond £and they havetherof greet solas, spoort, and comfort, £I shal telle somwhat £that I have sey. £JohnMaundevyle knyght, £thow Y be nought worthi, £that was bore in Engelond £in thetoun of Seynt Albones £and passed the see £in the yer of the Incarnacioun £of OureLord Jhesu Crist 1332 £uppon Seynt Michelis day. £And sithe hiderward £have Y belong tyme £over the see, £and have Y seye £and go thorgh many londes, £and Y leyghin many provinces and kyngdomes. 
I have passed thorgh Turky and Surry, £Hermony the Lasse and the More, Tartari, Perce, Arabie, Egipte the Heigh and the Lowe, Libie, Caldee, £and a greet party of Ethiope, Amazayn, £and a greet partyeof Inde the More and the Lasse, £and thorgh many other iles that beth aboute Inde, £wher that dwelleth many diverse folk £of maneris and diverse lawes and shappes. £Of which londes and iles £Y shal speke more plenerly. £And Y shal divise a parti of that £Y have seye in the worlde £as hit may come £to my mynde herafter. £And speciali of hem that wole and beth £in purpos to visite the holy cité of Jerusalem, £and theholy places that beth thereaboute, £and weyes which £men shul holde thider, £for Yhave many tymes y-passid and ryden £to Jerusalem in company £of greet lordesand other good companye. 
In the name of God Almyghty, £whoso wole passe £over the see, £he may go bymany waies £after the contré £that he cometh fro, £and many of hem cometh to ooneynde. £But troweth nought £that Y wole telle all the tounes, citees, and castelles £thatmen shul go by, £for then sholde Y make a long tale, £but sum contreis and mostprincipal stedes £that men shul go thorgh to the ryghte way. £Ferst, if a man come £fro the west side of the worlde £as Ingelonde, Walys, Skotlond,Irlond, Norway, £he may if he wole go thorgh Almayne £and the kyngdome of Hungré, £that marcheth to the lond of Poyaline £and to the lond of Panonye and Alfeigh. 
The kyng of Hungré £is right a greet lorde £and holdeth greet londes and fele,£for he holdeth the lond £of Hungré, Savoyze, Comayne, £a greet party of Bulgariethat £men calleth the lond of Bugers, £and a greet party of the kyngdome of Rosse,£and hit lastith to the lond of Neflond, £and hit marcheth to Pruysse. £And in thelond of Hungrie, £men goon thorgh a cité £that men calleth Chipproun £and thorghthe castel of Newbow, £by the same toun £that is toward the eynde of Hungrie. £And thenne men passeth £by the ryver of Danubye, £that is a greet ryver £and hit goth toAlmayne £under the hilles of Lombardy, £and hit taketh into hym 40 other ryversand £hit renneth thorgh Hungry, £thorgh Grecis, thorgh Tarchie, £and goth into thesee £so swiftly that the water £is fressh 20 mile in the see. 
And then men goth to Belgrave £and entre into the lond of Bruges £and thermen passith a brugge of stoon £that is over the rever of Marrok. £And so passiththorgh the lond of Pynceras £and cometh to Grece, £to the cité of Sternes, £and to thecité of Affynpayn, £and so to the cité of Bradremple, £and thenne to Constantynople,£that was sumtyme called Bessamoran, £and ther dwelleth comunely the emperour of Grece. £Ther is the beste cherch £of the worlde and fairest, £and hit is of Seynt Sophie. £And byfore this cherch £is an image of Justinian the emperour £y-gilded uppon anhors y-crouned. £And hit was woned £to holde an apple rounde in his hond. 
Andmen seyn ther £that hit is a tockne £that the emperour hath i-loste £a greet party ofhis lond, £for the appill is fall out of the imageis hond £for he lost gret party of hislordship. £For he was woned £to be emperour£of Romayne and Grece £and all Asie theLasse, of Syrrie, £and of the lond of Jude, £in the which is Jerusalem, £and of the londof Egipt, £of Percie, and Arabie; £but hit was lost — £all but Grece. £And men manytymes wolde putte the apple £into the imageis hond, £but he wolde nought holde hit. 
And his other hond he holt upward £to the west in tockne to manasse mysdowers. £This image stondeth £uppon a pilour of marbell. £At Constantynople ther £is the sponge and the reed £of the which the Jewes gafOure Lorde to drynke £galle uppon the Croys. £Som men lyveth that half of theCroys of Crist £be in Cipre in an abbey of monkes, £that men calleth the hille of theHoly Croys; £but hit is nought so, £for that crosse £that is in Cipre £is that crosse £thatuppon which Dismas, £the good theef, was honged. 
But all men woot nought, £and that is nought wel y-do, £for they seyn for getyng of offryng that hit £is the Croysof Our Lord Crist. £And ye shal understonde £that the Croys of Our Lord £was imakydof foure maner of trees, £and hit is conteyned in this verse: £In cruce fit £palma, cedrus, cipressus, oliva. £For that pece £that went upright fro the erthe £into the heedwas of cipresse; £and that pece overthwart £into the which the hondes £wer nayled was of palme; £and the mortais of cedre; £and the table above his heed £that was a footand half long, £uppon the which £the title was wryten in Ebru, Greu, and Latyn, £was of olive: £Jhesu Nazarenus, rex Judeorum. 
And the Jewes makid this Cros £of thesefoure maner of trees £for they wened that Oure Lord £sholde have honged upponthat Cros £als longe as that Cros myght have dured. £And therfore they maked thefoot of cedre, £for cedre may nought rote in erthe, £nother in water. £And for theywente £that the body of Crist £sholde have stonke, £therfore was maked a peece £thatwent fro the erthe upward of cipres: £for that tre is wel smellyng, £so that the stenchof His body £shold nought have greved men £that passid therby. 
And that overthwartpeece £was maked of palme, £for in the Olde Testament £was ordeyned that when £anyman hadde victorye £he was crouned with palme. £And the table of the title £wasmaked of olive, £for that tree tokned pees, £as the story of Noe witnessith hit, £whanthe culver brought the branch of olive£ that bitokneth pees y-maad £bytwixt God andman. £And so trowed the Jewes £to have pees when Crist were deed, £for they seidethat Crist £makid the bate among hem. £And ye shal understonde £that Our Lord was nayled £to the Cros liggyng, £andtherfore He suffred the more payn. £As Grekes and Cristin men £that dwelleth overthe see seyn, £that the tre of the Cros £that we callen cipresse £was of the tree £thatAdam eet of the apple, £and so fynde they writen. 
And they sayn that her scripturetelleth £that Adam was sike and bad £his son Seth that he sholde go to Paradis £andpray the angel that kepid Paradis £that he wolde sende hym £of the oyle of mercy £toanoynty therwith his membris £that he myght have heel. £And Seth wente theder, £butthe angel wold nought lete hym in, £but seyde to hym £that he myght nought havethe oyle of mercy. £But tho he toke hym foure graynes £of the same tre £that Adameet of the apple £and bad hym als so sone £as his fader were deed, £he sholde put thograynes £under his tonge £and grave hym so. 
And he dide so. £And of these fouregraynes spronge foure trees, £as the angel seyd, £which sholde bere a fruyt, £thorghwhich fruyt Adam sholde be saved. £Of which trees was maad the Cros £that bareGod Jhesu Crist, £that sweet fruyt £thorgh which Adam £and alle that come £of hymwere saved and deliverid £fram eyndelys deth, £but hit be here owen defaute. £ThisHoly Cros hadde the Jewes i-hudde £in the erthe £under the roch of the mount ofCalvarie, £and hit lay ther 200 yer and more £into that tyme that Seynt Eline fondhit. £The which Seynt Eline was £moder of Constantyn, £the emperour of Rome, £andsheo was doughter of a kyng, £the which was kyng of Ingelond £that was that tymecalled £the Greet Brytayne, £when the emperour toke £her to wyve for here greetfairnesse £when he was in that contré. 
And ye shal understonde £that the Cros ofOure Lord £was of leyngthe of eyght cubitis, £and that overthwart £was of thre cubitisand an half. £A party of the croune of Our Lord, £wherwith He was i-crouned, £and oon of thenailes, £and the speer-heed, £and many other relikes beth in Fraunce in the kyngeschapel. £And the croune beth £in a vessel of cristal wel y-dight and richely. £For akyng of Fraunce £somtyme boughte these relikis of the Jewes, £to wham the emperourhad i-leyd £to wedde for a greet somme of goolde and silver. £And though hitbe £so that men sayn that hit beth thornes, £ye shal understond £that His was risshesof the see £that beth white, wecle, and priketh £as sharply as thornes. 
For I have seymany tymes £that croune of Parys £and also of Constantinople, £for they beth but ofoon £y-maked of risshes of the see. £But they have departed hem £in two parties,£of which oon party is at Parys £and that other party is at Constantynople. £And Yhave a poynt therof, £and that semeth whit thorn, £and that was y-give £to me for gretlove, £for ther beth many broken and fallen £in the vessel wher the croun is, £as theybreken when men stiren the vessel £to shewe the croune £to greet lordes that comeththider. £And ye shal understonde that Our Lord, £that nyght that He was take, £He waslad into a gardeyn £and there He was examined sharply. £And ther the Jewesskorned Hym £and makyd hym a croune of the branche of the albespine £thatgrowed in the same gardeyn £and sette hit uppon His heed £so faste that the bloodran adoun £by many places of His visage, £and His necke, £and His shuldres. 
Andtherfor hath the albespyne many vertues. £For he that berith a branch uppon hym,£ne shal no thundre £ne no tempest in no maner hym deer. £Ne in the hous £that hitis ynne £may noon yvel spirit com, £ne in place £wheer hit is. £And in the same gardeyn£Seynt Petir deneyd Oure Lord God thries. £And afterward Oure Lord was y-lad £byfore the bysshopis of the lawe £in anothergardeyn of Anne, £and ther He was examined £and also y-skorned and y-crounedwith £a whit thorn £that men callen barbarines £that groweden in the same gardeyn,£and that hath als many vertues. 
And then was He y-lad £into the gardeyn of Cayphas,£and ther He was y-crouned with englenter. £And then He was y-lad into thechambre of Pilat, £and ther He was examined and also y-crouned. £And tho theJewes sette Hym £on a chayre and clothid Hym £in a mantel, £and they makydthe croune £of rysshes of the see £and knelid to Hym £and skorned Hym £and sayde: £Ave, rex Judeorum. £That is to say: £"Hayl, kyng of Jewes." 
And of this croune £is oon halfendeel at Parys £and that other deel at Constantinople. £And this croune He haddeuppon His heed £when He was doon on the Cros, £and therfore hit is most worthi. £And the sper shaft hath the emperour of Almayne, £but the heed is at Paris. £Also atConstantynnople £lyth Seynt Anne Our Lady Moder, £for Seynt Eline brought hurether fro Jerusalem. £And ther lith also the body of John Crisostom, £that was bysshopof Constantinople. £And ther lith Seynt Luke the Evangelist, £for his bonys werebrought £fro Bethany wher he was grave. £And many other relikes beth ther. £Andther is the vestel of ston as hit were marble, £which men callen ydrions, £that evermore droppeth water £and fillith hymself ech yer. 
And ye shal understond £that Constantinople is right a fair cité and a good, £andryght wel y-walled, £and hit is thre cornerid. £And ther an arme of the see that mencallen Hellesponte, £and som callen hit Bouch of Constantynople, £and som callenhit Brace de Seynt Gorge. £And this water closeth two parties £of the cité. £Andupwarde to the see £uppon the water was y-woned £to be the greet cité £of Troyein a ful fair playn, £but that cité was destroyed £with men of Grece. £And ther beth manyiles £that men callen thus: £Calastre, Calcas, Cetige, Tesbiria, Arynona, Faxton,Molo, Carpate, and Lempne. £And in this ile is the Mount Athos £that passeth thecloudes. £And ther beth many spechis £and many contreis £the which beth obesshantto the emperour, £that is to saye £Turcople, Pynornard, Coma, Comange, Trachise,and Macidone, £of which Alisaundre was kynge, £and many other. 
In this contré was Aristotle y-bore £and in a cité £that men callen Strages, £a litlefro the cité of Trachye. £And at Strages was Aristotle y-grave, £and ther is an auteruppon his tumbe. £And ther they make £a greet feste every yer als though he werea seynt. £And uppon his auter they holden greet conseylis. £And they troweth thatthorgh inspiracioun £of God and of hym £they shal have the better consail. £In thatcontré beth right hyghe hilles, £and toward the eynde of Macedone £is a greet hillethat men callen Olimpus, £that departith Macedone and Trachie £and is high up tothe cloudes. 
And that other hille £that men calleth Aches £is so high that the shadeof hym £recheth to Olimpus £that is neygh 77 myle bytwyne. £And above that hille isthe eyr £so cleir that men may feile no wynd ther. £And therfore may no beest lyvether, £for the eyr is so drigh. £And men seyn in that £contré that philosopheris £somtyme wente uppon thilke £hill and helde to here nose a sponge i-moisted £with waterto have the eyr. £And above, in the poudre of the hill, £they writen letteris with herefyngres, £and at the yeris eynde they come ageyn £and fyndeth the same lettres £withoute eny faute. 
And at Constantynople the emperouris paleis £is right fair and wely-dight. £And therin is a fair paleis for justyng, £and hit is uppon stages, £that allemen may see the justes, £and under thilke stages beth stables £vauted for the emperouris hors, £and alle the pilouris beth of marbel. £And withinne the cherche of Seynt Sophie £a emperour wolde have i-graven hisfader £when he was deed. £And they makid the grave and fond a body £in the erthe,£and theruppon lay a greet plate of fyn goold. £And theruppon was i-writen £in Ebru,Gru, and Latyn thus: £Jhesu Cristus nascetur £de Virgine Maria £et ego credo in eum. 
Thatis to say: £"Jhesu Crist shal be bore £of the Virgyn Mari £and I belyve on Hym." £Andthe date of this, £when hit was leyd in the erthe, £was 2000 yer byfore that Our Lordwas y-bore. £And yit is that plate in the tresorie £of that cherche. £And men seyn thathit was the body £of Hermogenes the wise man. £And though hit be so £that men ofGrece beth Cristyn, £yit they varieth fro youre feith. £For they sey that the HolyGoost £com nought of the Sone £but fro the Fader, £and they beth nought £obesshentto the Cherche of Rome, £nother to the pope. 
And they seyn that her patriarch £hathals moche power over the see £as the pope on this side. £And therfore the Pope Johnthe Twelfthe sende lettres £to hem how Cristin feyth £shold be all oon. £And that theisholde be obesshant £to the Cherch of Rome £and to the pope, £that is Cristis vicaron erthe, £to wham God gaf playn power £for to bynde and to assoyle, £and therforthey sholde be obedient to hym. £And they sent agen to hym, £the pope, divers letters and anaswers, £and among other thyng £they seyde thus: £Potenciam tuam summamcirca tuos subdiectos £firmiter credimus. £Superbiam tuam summam tollerare £non possumus. 
Avariciam tuam summam saciare £non intendimus. £Dominus tecum sit. £Quia Dominus nobiscumest. Vale. £This is to say: £"We trowe well thi power £is greet uppon thy sogettis. £We mai nought suffre thi greet pride. £We beth nought in purpos £to stanche thigreet covetise. £Our Lord be with thee, £for He is with us. Farwell." £And other answershad they non of hem. £Also they makith here sacrament of sour loof breed, £for Our Lord makid £His of whete £in tockinyng of the Maundé, £and they drien hitby the sonne and kepen hit £all the yer, £and geven hit to sike £instede of Godis body. 
And they maken but oon unctioun £when they cristne children, £and they anoyntennoon sike man afor his deth. £And they seyn £that ther is noun Purgatory, £and thatsoules shal have £ne joye ne payne into the Day of Dome. £And they tellen that simplefornicacioun £is no deedly synne £but a kyndely thyng, £and that men and wymmenshul £be weddid but ons, £and whoso wole be wedded more, £her children bethbut bastardes £and i-gete in synne. 
And her prestis ben wedded as other ben. £Andthey seyn that oker £is noon synne dedly. £And they sillen benefis of Holy Cherch,£and so doth men in this contré, £and that is a greet sclaundre. £For now is simonie crouned kyng £in Holi Cherche. £They seyn also that in Lente £men sholde synge nomasse £but uppon the Saterday £and uppon the Soneday. £And they fasteth noughtthe Saterday £no tyme in all the yer, £but hit be Youle Eve other Pasche Eve. £And theysuffre no man £that cometh fro this side £of the see £to synge at her auters. 
But and hitfalle £that ther do by any happe, £they wassh her autres £afterward with holy water. £And they seyn that ther sholde be said £but oon masse at oon £autre uppon the day. £They seyn that Our Lord £ne eet never mete, £but He makid tocknyng of etyng. £Also they seyn that we synne deedly £in chavyng of oure beerdis, £for the berd is knowynga man fro a womman. £Also they seyn that we synne in etyng of beestis £that were defendid in the Oolde Lawe, £als swyn, hares, and other beestis. £And they seyn that wesynne in etyng £of flessh in the Wennesday, £als when we eete cheese other eyron onthe Fryday. 
And they cursen all tho £that etyn no flessh uppon the Saturday. £Alsothe emperour of Constantynople maketh £alle the patriarkys, £archebysshoppes, £andbysshoppes, £and geveth alle the digniteis and cherches, £and he depriveth hem £thatben worthi of the pryvacion. £Now thowe hit be £so that thes thynges £toucheth nought to my way, £yyt hit likithto many men £to hyre of the condicioun and lawes and maneris £of diverse londesand contrees. £And this is the ferst contré £that is discordant agen our feithe, £therfore I have setten here £that ye may wite the diversité £that is bytwixt our feith andheres, £for many man hath desier £to here speke of diverse thynges. 
Now come I ageyn to know the way £fro Constantynople. £Whoso wole go thorgh Turkye, £he goth thorgh the cité of Nyke £and passeth thorgh the gate of Thoimtot£that is ful hygh, £and hit is a myle £and an half fro Nyke. £And whoso wole may go £by the Brace of Seynt George, £and by the greet see, £ther Seynt Nicholas lith. £And ferstmen cometh to the ile of Cilo. £In that ile groweth mastik £uppon smale trees, £asplum trees other chery trees. £And then men goth £thorgh the ile of Pathmos, £therwroot Seynt John the Evaungelist the Apocalips. 
And when Our Lord deide, £SeyntJohn was of eelde of 32 yer £and he levede after the Passion of Crist 62 yer. £Fro Pathmos men goth to Ephesome, £a fair cité £and neygh to the see, £and therdeide Seynt John £and was grave byhiende £the autre in a tumbe. £And ther is a faircherche £in that place that Cristen men £were woned holde. £But in the tumbe ofSeynt John £is nothyng elles but manna, £for his body was translatid into Paradis. £Turkes haldeth now £that cité and all Asie the Lasse, £and therfor hit is called Turkey. 
And ye shal understande £that Seynt John leet make his grave £by his lyveand laide hymself therinne al quyk. £And therfor som seyn £that he deide nought £but that he restith therynne £ontothe Day of Dome. £And forsothe ther is a greet mervaile, £for men may se apartly theerthe £of the tumbe many tymes stire and meve, £as ther were a quyk thyng therunder. £And fro Ephesome men goth thorghe many iles £in the see unto the cité ofPathan, £wher Seynt Nicholas was bore, £and so to Marcha £wher he was chose to bebysshop, £and ther groweth ryght good wyn and strong, £that men callen wyn ofMarcha. £And fro then men may se £the iles of Grece, £the which the emperour gaff£somtyme to Jonays. 
And then men passen thurgh £the iles of Cofos and Lango, £ofwham Ypocras was lord. £And som sayn that in the ile of Lango £is Ypocrasis doughter £in maner of adragon £that is a hundred foot long, £as men seyn, £for I have hit nought seye. £Andmen of the iles callen here £ladi of the contrees. £And sheo lith in an old castel £andshewith her thre tymes a yer. £And she doth no man harm £but if any man do herharm, £and thus she is changed £fro a damysel to dragon thorgh a goddas £that mencallen Diana. £And men seyn £that she shal dwelle so £into the tyme £that a knyghtcome £that is so hardy £that der go to hure and kysse here mouth. 
And then shal sheturne agen £into hure owen kynde and be womman, £and therafter heo shal noughtlyve longe. £And hit is nought ferne ago £that a knyght of Rodes, £that was doughtiand hardy, £seyde that he wolde kysse her. £And when he was uppon £his horsand wente to the castel £and entred into the cave, £the dragon bygan to lift up his heedagen hym. £And when the knyght say the huge beest £he fled away. £And the dragonfolwed £and took hym £and bare hym maugre his teeth £uppon a roch £and cast hyminto the see £and so was he lost. 
And also a yong man £that wist nought of that dragon £went out of a shippe £andwent thorgh the ile £tille he com to that castel £and come to that cave. £And he wentso longe £til he fond a chambre. £And ther he saw £a damisel and she kembid hureheed £and lokyde on a myrrour, £and sheo hadde moche trosour aboute hure. £Andhe wente that sheo hadde be a comyn womman £that dwellid ther £to kepe men todele with here. 
He abood ther, £and tho the damysel saw the shade of hym in themerour. £She turned her and asked what he wolde, £and he seyde £he wolde be hureparamour £other hure lemman. £And she askid hym £wher he were a knyght, £and hesaide nay. £And then she saide £that she myght nought £be his lemman, £but she baadhym go ageyn £to his felawes £and make hym a knyght £and come ageyn on themorghe, £and she wolde com out of hure cave £and baad hym thenne kysse hure onthe mouth. 
And she baad hym £that he sholde have no drede."£For Y shal do theenoon harme, £for thow thou thenke £that Y am hidous," £she sayde, £"ghit drede theenought, £for hit is don £to me by enchauntement. £And if thou kysse my mouth, £thoushalt se me as thou dost nough. £And thou shalt have £alle these tresours, £and be mylord and lord £of these iles." £And he departid £fro here and come to his felawes £tothe shippe £and ther they makyde hym knyght. 
And come aghen £uppon the morghe£to kysse that damsel. £And when he saw her come £out of her cave £in shap of a dragon £he hadde so greet drede £that he fleyghe £to the shippe ayen. £And she folwydhym, £and when she saw £that he turned nought agen, £she bygan to crie £as a thyngthat hadde gret drede £and greet sorwe, £and she went agen £to hure cave. £And anoonthis knyght deide. £And sithen hiderward £myght no knyght se hure £but he deydeanoon. 
But when a knyght cometh that £is so hardy to kysse hure mouth, £he shalturne £that damysel to hure owen shappe, £and be lord of the contré byforeseyd. £And fro thenne men cometh to ile of Rodes, £whiche that the Hospitalersholden. £And that ile was somtyme take £fro the Emperour £and was woned somtymebe y-called Colles, £and so callen the Turkes yit. £And Seynt Poule in his pistle £wrotto the men of that ile. £This yle is fer 8 hundred myle fro Constantinople. £And fro this yle of Rodis £men goth to Cipre, £wher beth many vines £that ferstbeth reed £and after oon yer £they wexen all white. 
And the vines £that beth most whitebeth £most cleer and most smellyng. £And men passith by this way £by a place where £was woned be a greet cité £thatmen callid Satalay. £And al that contré £was lost thorgh foly of a yong man, £for hehadde a fair damysel £that he lovede, £and she dayde sodenly £and was y-do in graveof marble. 
And for the greet love that he hadde to hure, £he wente on the nyght tohere grave and oppenyd hit, £and lay by here and went his way. £And at the 9monthes ende, £a voys come to hym and seyde, £"Go to the tumbe £of that womman£and opene the tumbe £and byhold £what thow hast gyte on here. £And if thow lettefor to goo, £thee worth greet harm have." £And he yede and opened the tumbe, £and ther fley an heed ryght parolous £to se that fley even aboute the cité.
For schamefastnesse £is a manere drede £as it is iseide tofore. £Þanne by diuerse causes £we may preue £þat wymmen ben schamefast. £But hou it euere be £of þe cause þerof, £wymmen [scholde] ben schamefast; £for by cause of schamefastnesse £þei leuen and forsaken many foule dedes £þe whiche þei wolde not leue £noþer forsake £ner þat þei ben constreyned and wiþholde | £by chaynes of schamefastnesse. £Þe seconde, £wymmen ben to preysyng, £for comynlich þei ben mylde and merciable. £For comynliche wymmen, £children and olde men ben merciable £but not for þe same cause. 
For as it is iseid tofore, £children ben merciable £for þei ben innocent and demiþ and trowiþ £þat oþir ben innocent £and hauin harme with wronge £and hauin þerfore sone merci of hem. £And olde men ben merciable £for þei faillen in body and lif, £and hauen mercy and rewþe of oþere men £for oþere men £scholde haue mercye £and rewþe of hem. £For man is sone inclined for £to do to oþere men £as he wolde £þat oþere men dede to hym, £þerfore olde men hauen sone mercye £and rewþe of oþere men. £And wymmen ben merciable £for þei ben nesche of herte; £for þei þat ben nesche £of herte mowe not suffry hard doyng. £Þerfore wymmen hauen mercye and rewþe anon £whanne he seeþ oþere suffre harde peyns. 
Þe þridde is to wetynge of wymmen, £for comynlich whan wymmen ben mylde £þei ben swithe mylde, £and whanne þei ben crewel £þei ben swiþe cruel, £and whan þei ben schameles £þei ben to schameles. £For whanne wymmen ben bolde £to do foule dedes, £þei doun so foule dedes £þat vnneþe a man scholde be founde £to do so foule dedes £and be so schameles. £Þei þis þridde be ipreysed in good, £Ʒut in iuel it is to blamyng. £For it is iknowe £what is to preysyng in wymmen, £it is to rekenyng £what is to blamyng in hem. 
And we may specialliche in wymmen £fynde þre þat ben to blamynge: £first, for comonliche þei ben vicious and folwen passions; £þe seconde, for þei ianglen moche and stryuen and | chiden; £þe þridde, for þei ben vnstedefast and vnstable. £First, wymmen folwen passions £whanne þei mowe and ben intemporate, £for in hem lackeþ resoun £and hauen not whareby he scholde be withdrawe £fro lust and likyng £as a man haþ £þat is more irewled by resoun. £Þe seconde, wymmen ianglen and stryuen and chiden; £and þat is for þe same cause, £for comynlich resoun £is not þe brydel of a womman £for comynliche hem lakken resoun. 
But schamefastnesse brideleth a womman £more þan resoun; £and Ʒif wymmen ben conty[n]ent and iangleth £not noþer stryuen noþer chiden, £þat is more for schamefastnesse £þan for resoun. £Wherfore whanne þei ben imeued £þei conne not chaste hemself £bote ianglen and chiden £wiþoute bridel, £for we seen þat wymmen ianglen and chiden £lenger þan men £for þei hauen lasse resoun þan men. £Þe þridde, £wymmen ben vnstedefast and vnstable, £and oon caas þat comeþ of feble complexioun. £For as it is iseid tofore £comynliche þe soule folweþ þe complexioun of þe body. £Þerfore as wymmen hauen nesche bodi and vnstable, £so þei ben nesche and vnstable £in desire and in wil.
It is iseid tofore £þat wyues, children and seruantes £scholde not be rewled £by on manere rewlyng, £for þe housebonde scholde rewle his wif £oþer wise þan his children oþer seruantes. £Bote for it is not inouƷ £to trete vnyuersaliche £of rewelyng of wifes tellyng £þat it is in anoþer manere rewlyng £þan rewlyng of children and of seruantes £but it be treted specialliche £by what rewelyng wyues schulde be rewled, £þerfore it nedeþ to speke £in special som what of rewlyng of wyues. 
Þanne it | is to wetyng £þat oon is a comyne rewle £to al maner rewlyng; £f. sov for who euere be £þat wil reule eny thing wel moot haue special cautels £to amende þe defautes of þyng £þat schal be rewled. £For as it fareth in spekyng, £so it fareth in som wise in workes and dedes. £For we seen þat some men £ben parfit and renable of speche £and som men stameren and boffen. £And þei þat stameren and boffen £[ben] not al in o wyse, £for it is hardere £to som men to speke oo word £and for som to speke anoþer. 
And who þat wolde rewle stamerers and boffers £in spekynge moste teche hem £to take a special strif £and special fondyng £and afforsyng to speke þe wordes £þat þei mowe worst speke. £For we reden £þat sum philosofres £dede in þe same wise, £for þei were ilette £in þe tonge £and ofte fondede to sowne þe letters £þat þei myƷte worste sowne £and were so imaad parfit £and renable of speche. 
Þanne in þis wise £it most be in workes and dedes; £for whanne a man knoweth £þe defaute of hymself oþer of anoþer, £Ʒif he wol rewle hymself oþer anoþer arigt, £he moot specialliche fonde £to amende þe defautes £in þe beste wise £þat he can £and in sum esy manere. £Wherfore by cause þat wymmen, £as it was iseid £in þe nexte chapitre, £comynliche ben intemporate, £fol of iangelynge and vnstedefast and vnstable, £he mot be rewled £by suche rewiyng £þat he be brouƷt to be temporate, £softe and stille, stedefast and stable. £As it was iseid in þe firste book, £þe partees of temporancia £ben foure – chastite, honeste, abstinence and sobernesse. £And wymmen ben temporate £whanne þei ben chast, honest, abstinent and sobre. £And wifes scholde be chast not oon|liche £for to be trewe £to here housbondes £but also for conseyuyng £and beryng of children. 
For Ʒif a wif ys not chast £and trewe to here housebond, £it may liƷtliche happe þat anoþer child £þan his owne schal be þe housebondes eyre. £Þan it is semelich £þat al citeseyns wifes be chast. £And þat is more semlich for wyues of kynges and princes, £for of here mysgetyng children £may com more discord and strif. £Þe ii, it is semlich £þat wifes ben honest; £for it is not inow for wyfes £to be chast and kepe hemself £fro vnlaweful workes and dedes, £but þei moot also be pudic and honest £for to be war of tokenes and of wordes £þat semen mene £to be vnhonest £and is tokene þerof. 
For it is not inow £þat anoþer mannys child be not heire, £but it nedeþ £þat þe fader be siker and certeyne £of his owne childe. £Þanne for vnhonest tokenes and signes £maken suspecioun of incontinent wyues, £þat þe fader may be syker £and certayn of his owne childe £it is spedful £þat wyues be honest. £Þe þridde, £wyues mot be abstinent, £for to be waar of superfluyte of mete £and of drynke £is cause of incontinencia. 
Þe ferþe, wifes mot be sobre £and war of to moche drynke. £For superfluyte boþe of mete £and of drynke £is cause of lust £and of likynge of lecherie. £Þerfore in olde tyme £among wymmen of Rome, £as Valerius Maximus seith, £libro ii, capitulo De Institutis Antiquis, £how it was not laweful to drynke wyne. £Þerfore he seith £þat vse of wyne was vnknowe to wymmen of Rome £lest it scholde brynge hem to schame and velanye, £for ofte vse of wyne £was next to þe most venus. 
Þanne wyues scholde be so irewled £þat þei scholde be chast, honest, abstinent and sobre. £And þe manere £by þe whiche wyues scholde be ibrouƷt £to al þese is dyuerse £as housebondes ben diuerse £in gentellesse | and richesse. £[For citeseyns þat ben lackyng £in gentellesse and richesse] £scholde by hemself informe and teche £here wyues and vse þew cauteles £to make here wyues good £in þe manere of goodnesse [as] £it is iseid tofore. £But riche men and lordes £þat ben gentile and hauen cyuyle myƷt and power £scholde aspie wymmen of good fame £and of good age, wiƷse, £and of good maners £and þewes to teche here wyues £and brynge hem £in by þew monyciouns £and techynge to be chaast, honest, and sobre, £and to haue þe goodnesse £þat is irekened tofore. 
It is iknowe £how wyues scholde be rewled £to be temporate £and it is to declaryng £how þey scholde be irewled £to be soft and stille. £For as it is iwrete, primo Poleticorum, £ornament of wymmen is silens; £for Ʒif wymmen hauen silens £as þei scholde, £þei semen þerby þe more omate and ihiƷt £and þe bettre iloued of here housebondes. £Þanne it is semelich £þat wyues be softe and stille; £and also it is semelich £þat þei ben stedefast and stable, £for þe more stedefast and sad and stable £a wif is þe bettre a housebond troweþ £þat he doþ as sche scholde. 
Þanne by suche rewlenge wyues £scholde be reuled £to haue þe forseyde sixe propretees and goodnesse £þat þei ben chaast, honest, stille, abstynent, sobre and stable. £And to alle þese £þe housebondes may brynge hem by hemself £oþer by wymmen of good loos £and of good fame. £Wherfore it is semelich £þat alle cyteseyns rewle so here wyues; £and þe more perel may come to £þe regne of euel rewlyng of wyues of kynges and princes, £þe more semeliche it is £þat þei rewle so here wyues. £[I]t is not inow to wite and to knowe £how kynges and princes £and generallich al citeseyns £scholde rewle here wyues £and to | what goodnesse £þey scholde brynge here wyues £but it be also iknowe £how þei scholde bere £and haue hemself to here wyues. 
And as it longeth to þis doyng, £þre mote be knowe in þe whiche housbondes £scholde bere and haue hemself £wel to here wyues. £For firste, £þei scholde vse here wyues þewliche and moderatliche; £þe seconde, £þei scholde trete hem worschepfullich. £Þe þridde, £þey scholde abyde wiþ hem in þew tyme. £Housebondes scholde vse here wyues moderatliche and wisliche £for inmoderate and passyng vse of lecherie, £first, destroyen þe body; £þe seconde, £it bereth doun þe soule; £þe þridde, £it defouleth appetit and talent £and makeþ wyues intemporate. 
Þe body of þe housebonde is destroyed £Ʒif þei Ʒeuen hem £to moche to þe doynge of wedloc, £for þe vertue of generacioun £is to swythe corrupt; £and as þe philosofre meneþ, iii Ethicorum, £þe appetite of suche lust and likyng £may not haue ynow for comynliche £a man desireth more þan kynde nedeþ. £Þanne Ʒif a man folwen £þe appetite of doynge of wedloc £wiþoute bridel of refraynyng, £þanne he doþ more þanne kynde nedeþ £and spendeþ and wasteþ hymself £in more þan may be restored. 
And þat may not be £wiþoute feblyng of his owne body, £for þe brayn and siƷt and oþere lemes and membres £ben ifebled and apayred £by to greet vse of dede of wedloc. £Þe seconde, £to greet vse þerof £not oonliche febleþ þe body £but apeyreth and bereþ doun þe soule also. £For þe body is þe instrument of þe soule; £and as þe hamer is instrument of þe smyth, £and Ʒif þe hamer is febled and apayred, £þe | ‡ smethes woork is apeyred. £And so Ʒif þe brayn £and oþere noble membris £ben febled and apaired, £þe soule is ilette £of þe vse of resoun £so þat he may not haue witte and knoweleche £att þe fulle. 
Þerfore it is preued tofore £by auctorite of þe philosofer £þat suche passynge and ouer doyng smyteþ þe resoun. £Þe þridde, £suche doynge to moche ivsed defouleþ £þe appetite and makeþ wymmen intemporate; £for the more þey vsen lecherie, £þe more appetite is excited £to þe dede of lecherie, £as þe philosofer meneþ, £[vii Ethicorum. 
And þerfore þe lewed mevyng a meneþ £of som men is ipreued lewed: £þei menen þat þey now wollen do £þe dede of lust and likynge and absteyne ham afterward. £For eche vse of suche fleschliche likynge exciten £to vse it more afterward; £and þe more a persone vseþ it, £þe more he is excited £to vse suche a dede £and is alwey £þe more intemporate and more. £Þanne it is semelich £þat alle citeseyns vse moderatliche £þe fleschliche doyng of wedloc. 
And þe more vnsemeliche £it is þat kynges and princes £be apeyred in body £by suche doynge £and haue þe soule apeyred £and þe appetite intemporate, £þe more semelich it is £þat þei vse suche doynge temporatliche. £And it is not inow for hem £to vse suche doynge moderatliche £but þei vse it £also wisliche and redyliche. £For in alle workes and dedes £mot be wisdom and redinesse so £þat it be doun £in þewe tyme £and in couenable place and manere. £For som tyme soche doyng moot bee spared, £for in tyme of bedes and of prayers £suche doyng scholde be spared; £and also whanne harme and greef scholde come £of suche doynge, £suche doyng | scholde be spared. 
Þanne it most be do £in þew tyme £and in couenable place £and in conuenient manere, £for bytwene housebonde £and wyf scholde not be onlich likynge frendschipe £but also honest frendschipe. £For it is iknowe how housebondes £scholde moderatliche vse £here wyues and rediliche, £it is to declarynge £how þei scholde trete £here wyues honestliche. £For by þe staat and faculte of richesse £eche housebond scholde araye his wif £and fynde here £whaat here nedeþ. £For þe wif is a persone faste iioyned to þe housebonde, £and þerfore whaat is worschepe to þe wif £is worschep to þe housebonde. 
And for it is declared tofore £þat wif is not to þe housebonde £as his seruant £but as is his felawe, £eche housebonde scholde trete and araye his owne wyf £after his owne estate. £For it is declared £how housebondes scholde moderatliche, wisliche, £and rediliche vse here wyues £and howþei scholde trete hem worschepliche, £it is to declarynge £whaat conuersacioun housebondes £scholde haue to here wyues. £And housebondes hauen good conuersacioun £with here wyues £Ʒif þey schewen to hem £tokenes of loue and of frendschipe £and Ʒif þei taken hem £by good informacioun and loore. £And þewe signes and tokenes and frendschipe and couenable informacioun and lore £may not be declared £but [by] takynge hede £of dyuerse states and condiciouns of persones. 
For þe housebonde scholde besiliche £take hede wheþer here £wyues ben proute oþer meke £and wheþer þey ben wyse oþer foles. £For housebondes scholde haue such conuersacioun with here wifes £so þat þei schulde schewe £mo tokenes of loue to hem £þat ben meke þan to hem £þat ben proute; £| for proute wyues ben so stoute of herte £þat Ʒif þe housebonde schewe to hem £many tokenes of loue, £þey wollen fonde to be here £housebondes maistres and ladies. £Also housebondes schulde haue £suche conuersacioun with here wifes £þat wise wyues and foles scholde be £dyuersliche enformed and itauƷt. £For wise wyues wol be tauƷt and corrected £by faire wordes and plesynge, £but wyues þat been fooles £mot be more scharpliche iblamed. 
þanne alle housebondes scholde take heede £to here owne estaate £and of condiciouns of persones £and schewe to here wyues þew tokenes of frendschipe £and of loue and teche hem £by þew warnynges and loore. £Kynges and princes £and generalliche alle citeseyns scholde £wete and iknowe £how þei scholde araye here wyues. £For þe housebond scholde rewle þe wif and brynge here £to honeste workes and vertues, £it is spedful £þat alle housebondes take hede £wherinne wymmen trespassen comynliche£and take heede and knowe £what is laweful and vnlawefulle. 
And for comynliche wymmen desiren most £to be holde faire £and trespasseth specialiche desyrynge and louynge £to be gayliche arayed, £wherfore housebondes £scholde knowe what aray of wymmen is leeful £and what araye is vnlefful. £For wymmen ben neuere vertuous £but þei forsake and leue vnlefful doyng £and, primo Rethoricorum, £þe philosofer declareth £how greet harm falleþ to regne £and to citee by wymmen £þat ben not vertuous £noþer louen leefful doynge £but vnlefful. £And he spekeþ of þe Lacedemonyes, £men of þe lond £þat | hatte Lacedemonia, £and seith þat þei ben vngracious £in þe haluendele £for þei soffren þeire wyues £do vnlufful doyng. 
Þanne for þe hous of a prince £oþer of a citeseyn £scholde not be vngracious £in þe haluendele £noþer in oþer wyse, £princes and citeseyns scholde rewle £here wyues in araye £and chaste hem £in alle doyng £in þe whiche wymmen trespassen ofte. £Þanne it is to wetynge £as it longeþ herto £þat wymmen araye stondeþ in tweyne, £for som araye is ifeyned £and som is verrey in dede.£And for suche araye is ifeyned, £it is vnleufful and forbode. 
Þe oþer araye is not ifeyned £but it stondeþ in þewe ornamentes of araye £and Ʒif wymmen ben þerwyþ arayed semelich £as here astaat axeth þanne £it is lefful and honest. £And housebondes scholde araye here wyues £as here astaat axen in cloþyng £and oþere omamentes. £Þerfore Valerius Maximus preyseþ þe Romayns £for þei arayen here wyues in fayre clothynge £and in oþere ornamentes. £Þanne so it scholde be of ornament and araye. £But for to teche wyues more specialliche £how þei scholde be arayed £in cloþynge and in oþere omamentes, £it is to wetynge £þat in cloþynge wymmen £may trespace in twey wise: £first, in takynge more þanne inow, £þe seconde by lacke and defaute. 
For to putte of more þan inowƷ it | £nedeþ to haue þre vertues £þe whiche ben itouched £by Andronycus Peripateticus in his book £þat he makeþ of vertues. £And þis þre vertues ben icleped humilitas, moderancia and symplicitas: £mekenesse, moderatnesse and semplenesse. £And wymmen ben meke in araie £whanne þei arayen hemself semliche and wel £and not for prude and veyn glorie £but for to plese here housebondes £and for to wiþdrawe hem fro fornicacioun. £And þei ben moderate £whan þei taken heede £to here owne astaat and axeth £not to greet araye. £For a knygtes wif scholde be betere arayed £þanne a symple citeseynes wif £and a kynges wif oþer a princes £wif scholde be better arayed þanne oþere symplere wyues. £Also Ʒif eny mannes £wif were meke and arayed not for veyn glorye, £Ʒit he myƷt trespase in araye £Ʒif schue were not moderat £but arayed passyng here owne astaat. 
Þe þridde, £wymmen scholde be symple in araye £so þat þei scholde not be to besy £to haue greet araye. £For þeiƷ a womman be not arayed £for veyne glorie £noþer passynge here owne estaat, £Ʒut sche may trespasse £Ʒif sche is to besy £aboute here owne array. £Þanne in þre manere wise £may be superfluyte of aray. 
In tweyne may be trespace, £wherfore, in defaute and lacke. £First, Ʒif it is for sleuthe and necligence, £for sum wymmen ben so slowe and reccheles £þat onliche for necgligence £þey leeuen to araye hemself £as þei scholde. £Þe seconde, £in suche defaute is trespas £Ʒif wymmen wenen to be preysed £for suche lacke and defaute. £For som tyme som man £is prout of wrecchednesse £þat he suffreþ. | £For as it fareth £in lame men and seeke £þat ben at cherche dores, £comynliche he þat is most lame £oþer sike is best apaied; £for he troweth þat most men £wol loke on hym and hopeth £to haue most almesse and Ʒiftes. 
So sum tyme he þat is worst arayed £in cloþynge is most prout for þei trowen £to be preysed þerfore. £Þanne wymmen trespassen £Ʒif þei ben proute of euel araye £and defaute of cloþynge. £Þerfore, iiii Ethicorum, £þe philosofer blameþ £þe Lathanies suche men £for þei were cloþed worst £þan here astaat axede £and were stoute £and proute þerfore. £Þanne wyues scholde be £so reweled in araye £so þat þei be besiliche itauƷt £to knowe þe sixe þat ben itouched. £For firste, £þei scholde be iwamed and icharged £to vse no feyned araye. £Þe seconde, £to be humyle and meke £þat þei be not passynglich arayed £for euel noþer for veyn glorye. 
Þe þridde, £þat þey ben moderat £þat þey be not arayed passyng here owne astaat. £Þe ferþe, £þat þei ben symple £and not trauele £to besiliche aboute here awne aray. £Þe fifþe, £þat þey be not necligent noþer notabliche £for slouthe arayed worse £þan here astaat axeth. £Þe sixte, £þat þei ben not prout neiþer desire £to be preysed for euel £and for wrecchede araye £and for defaute of clothing.
For so moche as noble persones £cannot rewle ne governe £without the servyse and werke £of the people, £than hit behoveth £to devyse the oultrages £and the offyces of the werkmen.
Than I shal begynne first £at the first pawn £that is in the play of the chesse £and signefieth £a man of the comyn peple on fote.
For they be al named “pietons," £that is as moche £to say as footmen.
And thenne we wyl begynne £at the pawn £whyche standeth £tofore the rooke £on the right syde of the kyng, £for as moche as thys pawne apperteyneth £to serve the vycayre or lyeuetenaunt £of the kyng and other officers £under hym of necessaries of vytaylle.
And this maner of peple is figured £and ought be maad £in the forme and shappe £of a man holdyng £in his right honde £a spade or shovel, £and a rodde in the lyft hand.
The spade or shovel is for £to delve and labour £therwyth the erthe, £and the rodde is for £to dryve and conduyte £wyth al the bestys £unto her pasture.
Also, he ought to have £on hys gyrdel £a sarpe or crokyd hachet £for to cutte £of the superfluytees £of the vignes and trees.
And we rede in the Bible £that the first labourer £that ever was was Caym, £the first sone of Adam, £that was so evyl £that he slewe his broder Abel, £for as moche as the smoke £of his tithes £went strayt unto heven, £and the smoke and fume £of the tythes of Caym £went dounward upon the erthe.
And how wel that thys cause was trewe.
Yet was there another cause of envye £that he had unto his broder.
For when Adam, theyr fader, £maryed them £for to multeplye the erthe of his ligne, £he wold not marye ner joyne £togyder the two £that were borne attones, £but gaf unto Caym £her that was born with Abel, £and to Abel £her that was borne wyth Caym.
And thus began the envye £that Caym had ayenst Abel, £for hys wyf was fayrer £than Caym’s wyf.
And for this cause he sle[we] Abel £wyth the chekebone of a beste.
And at that tyme was never no maner of yron £blody of manne’s blood.
And Abel was the fyrst martir £in the Olde Testament.
And thys sayd Caym £dyd many other evyl thynges £whiche I leve, £for it apperteyneth not to my mater.
But it behoveth for necessyté 
that somme shold laboure the erthe £after the synne of Adam.
For tofore or Adam synned, £the erthe brought forth fruyt £without labour of handes.
But sithe he synned, £hit must nedes be laboured £with the handes of men.
And for as moche as the erthe £is moder of al thynges, £and that we were first formed £and took our begynnyng of the erthe, £the same wyse at the last, £she shal be the ende £unto al us and to al thynges.
And God that formed us £of the erthe hath ordeyned £that by the labour of men £she shold gyve nourysshyng £unto al that lyveth.
And first the labourer of the erthe £ought to knowe his God £that formed and made heven and erthe of nought, £and ought to have loyalté 
and trouth in hymself, £and despise deth £for to entende to his labour.
And he ought to geve thankynges £to hym that made hym £and of whom he receyveth £al his goodes temporal, £wherof his lyf is susteyned.
And also, he is bounden £to paye the dismes and tythes £of al his thynges, £and not as Caym dyd £but as Abel dyd of the beste £that he chese out alwey £for to gyve to God £and to plese Hym.
For they that grutche and be greved £in that they rendre and geve to God £the tienthes of her goodes, £they ought to be aferd £and have drede £that they shal falle in necessyté, £and that they myght be despoylyd or robbyd £by warre or by tempest £that myght falle or happen in the contray.
And hit is no merveylle, £though hyt so happen £for that man that is disagreable £unto God and weneth £that the multeplyeng £of his goodes temporel cometh £by the vertu of his owne counceyl £and his witte, £the whiche is made £by the only ordenaunce of Hym £that made al, £and by the same ordenaunce £is sone taken awey £fro hym that is disagreable.
And hit is reson £that whan a man haboundeth £by fortune in goodes £and knowith not God £by whom it cometh, £that to hym come somme other fortune £by the whiche he may £requyre grace and pardon, £and to knowe his God.
And we rede of the Kyng Davyd, £that was first symple £and one of the comyn peple, £that whan fortune had enhauncid £and sette him in grete estate, £he left and forgate his God, £and fyl to advoultrie and homycide £and other synnes.
Than anone his owne sone, £Absalon, assaillid £and began to persecute hym. £And than whan he sawe £that fortune was contrarye to hym, £he began to take ageyn his vertuous werkis £and requyred pardon £and so retorned to God agayn.
We rede also of the children of Ysrael, £that were nygh enfamyned in desert, £and sore hungry and thrusty, £that they prayed £and requyred of God for remedye.
Anone He chaunged His wille £and sent to hem manna and flessh.
And whan they were replenysshed and fatte £of the flessh of bestes £and of the manna, £they made a calf of gold £and worshipped hit, £whiche was a grete synne and inyquyté.
For whan they were hongry, £they knewe God.
And whan theyr belies £were filled and fatted, £they forgid ydolles £and were ydolatreres.
After this every labourer £ought to be faithful and trewe, £that whan his maister delyvereth £to hym his lande to be laboured, £that he take nothyng to hymself £but that he ought to have and is his, £but laboure truly £and take cure and charge £in the name of hys maystre, £and do more diligently hys mayster’s labours £than his owen, £for the lyf of the most grete and noble men £next God lieth £in the handes of the labourers.
And thus al craftes and occupacions ben ordeyned £not only to suffise to them only £but to [the] comyn.
And so it happeth oft tyme £that the labourer of the erth £useth grete and boistous metis, £and bryngeth to his maister £more subtile and more deynteous metes.
And Valerius rehercith in his sixt book £that there was a wyse and noble maistre £that was named Anthonius, £that was accusid of a caas of avoultry.
And as the cause henge £tofore the juges, £his accusers or denonciatours brought a labourer £that closed his lande, £for so moche as they sayd £whan his mayster went £to do the advoultrye, £this same servaunt bare the lanterne, £wherof Anthonius was sore abasshid £and douted that he shold depose agaynst hym.
But the labourer, £that was named Papirion, £said to his maister £that he shold denye his cause hardily £unto the juges, £for to be tormentid, £his cause shold never be enpeyred by hym, £ner nothyng shold yssue £out of his mouth £wherof he shold be noyed or grevyd.
And than was the labourer beten and tormentid, £and brent in many places of his body.
But he sayd never thyng £wherof his maister was hurt or noyed.
But the other that accused his maister were punysshed, £and Papirion was delyverd £of his paynes.
And also tellith Valerius £that there was another labourer £that was named Penapion, £that servyd a maister £whos name was Themes, £which was of mervaillous faith £to his maister.
For hit befel £that certeyn knyghtes cam £to his maister’s hows £for to slé hym.
And anone as Penapion knewe hit, £he went into his maister’s chambre £and wold not be knowen, £for he did on his mayster’s gowne £and his rynge on his fyngre, £and lay in his bedde, £and thus put hymself in parelle of deth £for to respyte hys mayster’s lyf.
But we see nowadayes many fooks £that daigne not £to use grose metis of labourers £and flee the cours clothyng £and maners of a servaunt.
Every wyse man [who is] a servaunt £that trewly servyth his maister £is free and not bonde.
But a fool that is over proud is bonde.
For the debylité and feblenes of corage £that is broken in conscience £by pryde, envye, £or by covetyse is right servytude.
Yet they ought not to doubte to laboure.
For fere and drede of deth, £no man ought to love £to moche his lyf, £for hit is a foul thyng £for a man to renne £to the deth £for the envye of his lyf.
And a wyse man £and a stronge man £ought not to fle £for his lyf, £but to yssue. £For there is no man £that lyveth £but he must nedes dye.
And of this speketh Claudyan, £and saith that al tho thynges £that the ayer goth £about and envyronneth, £and alle thyng that the erthe laboureth, £al thynges that ben conteyned £within the see, £al thynges that the flodes brynge forth, £alle thynges that ben norisshed, £and al the bestes that ben £under the heven shal deporte £alle from the world.
And al shal goo £at His commaundement, £as wel kynges, prynces, £and al that the world envyronneth £and goeth about.
Alle shal goo this way.
Than he ought not to doubte £for fere of deth.
For as wel shal dye the ryche £as the poure.
Deth maketh alle thynge lyke £and putteth al to an ende.
And therof made a noble versefyer £two versis whiche folowe: £“Forma, genus, mores, sapiencia, res, et honores / £Morte ruant subita £sola manent merita. £" 
Wherof the Englissh is: £“Beauté, lignage, maners, wysedom, thynges and honoures / £Shal ben deffetid by sodeyn deth; £nothyng shal abyde £but the meritis. £" 
And herof fynde we in Vitas patrum £that ther was an erle, £a riche and noble man, £that had a sone onely.
And whan thys sone was of age £to have knowleche of the lawe, £he herde in a sermone £that deth spareth none.
And as wel dyeth the yonge £as the olde.
And that the deth ought specially £to be doubted £for thre causes.
One was that no man knoweth £whan he comyth.
And the second, £ner in what state £he taketh a man.
And the thyrd, £he wote never £whether he shal goo.
Therfore eche man £shold dispyse £and flee the world, £and lyve wel, £and holde hym toward God.
And whan this yonge man £herde this thyng, £he wente out of his contray £and fledde unto a wyldernesse £unto an hermytage.
And whan his fader had loste hym, £he made grete sorowe £and dyd do enquere £and seke hym so moche £that atte last he was founden £in the hermytage.
And thenne his fader £cam theder to hym and sayd, £“Dere sone, come from thens! £Thou shalt be after my dethe erle £and chyef of my lignage.
I shal be lost £yf thou come not £out from thens." £And he than, £that wyst none otherwyse £to eschewe the yre of his fader, £bethought hym and sayd, £“Dere fader, £there is in your contré 
and lande a right evyll custume.
Yf hit plese you £to put that awey, £I shal gladly come £out of this place £and goo with you."
The fader was glad and had grete joye, £and demaunded of hym £what hit was.
And yf he wolde telle hym, £he promysed hym £to take hit awey, £and hit shold be lefte £and sette aparte. £Than he sayd, £“Dere fader, £there dyen as wel the yonge folke £as the olde in your contray.
Do that awey, £I praye you."
Whan his fader herde that, £he sayd, £“Dere sone, £that may not be, £ner no man may put that awey £but God onely."
Than answerd the sone to the fader, £“Than wyl I serve Hym £and dwelle here wyth Hym £that may do that."
And so abode the childe £in the hermytage £and lyved there in good werkis.
After this, £hit apperteyneth to a labourer £to entende to his labour £and flee ydelnes.
And thou oughtest to knowe £that Davyd preyseth moche £in the Sawlter £the trewe labourers and sayth, £“Thou shalt ete the labour £of thyn handes £and thou art blessyd, £and He shal doo £to thee good."
And hit behoveth £that the labourer endende £to his labour £on the werkedayes £for to recuyel and gadre togydre £the fruyt of hys laboure.
And also, he ought to reste on the holy day, £bothe he and hys bestys.
And a good labourer £ought to norisshe and kepe his bestys.
And this is signyfyed £by the rodde £that he hath, £whiche is for to lede £and dryve them to the pasture.
The first pastour £that ever was was Abel, £whyche was juste and trewe, £and offrid to God the bestis £unto hys sacrefise.
And hym ought he to folowe £in craft and maners.
But no man that useth £the malyce of Caym £maye ensue and folowe Abel.
And thus hit apperteyneth £to the labourer £to sette and graffe trees and vygnes, £and also to plante and cutte them.
And so dyd Noe, £whyche was the first £that planted the vygne £after the deluge and flood.
For as Josephus reherceth £in the Book of Naturel Thynges, £Noe was he that fonde first the vigne, £and he fonde hym bytter and wylde.
And therfore he took four maners of blood, £that is to wete £the blood of a lyon, £the blood of a lamb, £the blood of a swyne, £and the blood of an ape, £and medlid them al togeder £wyth the erthe.
And than he cutte the vigne £and put thys about the rotes therof, £to the ende that the byttirnes £shold be put awey, £and that hit shold be swete.
And whan he had dronken £of the fruyt of thys vygne, £hit was so good and myghty £that he becam so dronke £that he despoyled hym £in suche wyse £that his pryvy membres myght be seen.
And his yongest sone, £Cham, mocqued and skorned hym.
And whan Noe was awaked £and was sobre and fastyng, £he assemblid his sones £and shewed to them £the nature of the vygne and of the wyn, £and tolde to them the cause £why that he had put the blood £of the bestes £about the rote of the vigne, £and that they shold knowe £wel that otherwhile, £by the strengthe of the wyn, £men be maad £as hardy as the lyon and yrous.
And otherwhile, £they be made symple and shamefast as a lambe, £and lecherous as a swyne, £and curious and ful of play as an ape.
For the ape is of suche nature £that whan he seeth one doo a thyng, £he enforceth hym £to do the same, £and so don many £whan they ben dronke.
They wyl meddle them £with al offycers and maters £that apperteyne nothyng to them.
And whan they ben fastyng and sobre, £they can scarcely accomplisshe theyr owne thynges.
And therfore, £Valerian reherceth £that of auncient £and in olde tyme women dranke no wyn, £for as moche as by dronkenshyp, £they myght falle £in ony filthe or vylony. £And as Ovyde saith, £that the wynes £otherwhyle apparaylle the corages £in suche manere £that they ben covenable to al synnes, £whiche take awey the hertes £to do wel.
They make the poure, riche, £as longe as the wyn is in his heed.
And shortly, dronkenshyp is the begynnyng £of alle evylles, £and corrupteth the body, £and destroyeth the sowle, £and mynyssheth the goodes temporels.
And this suffiseth for the labourers.
The second chappytre of the thyrd tractate £treteth of the forme and maner £of the second pawne £and of the maner of a smyth.
Capitulo secundo.
The second pawn that stondeth £tofore the knyght £on the right syde of the kyng £hath the forme and fygure of a man £as a smyth £and that is reson.
For hit apperteyneth £to the knyghtes £to have bridellys, sadellis, spores, £and many other thynges maad £by the handes of smythes, £and ought to holde an hamer £in his right hond, £and in his lift hande a squyer.
And he ought to have £on his gyrdel a trowel, £for by this is signefyed £alle maner of werkmen £as goldsmythes, marchallis, smythes of alle forges, forgers £and makers of money.
And al maner of smythes £ben signefyed £by the martel or hamer.
The carpenters ben signefyed £by the dolabre or squyer.
And by the trowel we understonde £al masons and kervers of stones, tylers, £and al those that make howses, castels, and towres.
And unto al thyse crafty men hit aperteyneth £that they be trewe, wyse, and stronge. £And hit is nede £that they have £in hemself fayth and loyaulté.
For unto the goldsmythes £behoveth golde and sylver, £and alle other metallys, £yren and steel, to other.
And unto the carpentiers and masons £ben put to theyr edefyces £the bodyes and goodes of the peple.
And also men put in the handes of the maroners £body and goodes of the peple.
And in the garde and sewerté of them, £men put body and sowle £in the parilles of the see.
And therfore ought they to be trewe £unto whom men commytte suche grete charge £and so grete thynges £upon her fayth and truste.
And therfore sayth the phylosopher: £“He that leseth his fayth and beleve £may lose no gretter ne more thynge."
And fayth is a soverayn good £and cometh of the good £wylle of the herte £and of his mynde, £and for no necessyté wyl deceyve no man, £and is not corrupt £for no mede.
Valerius rehercith £that Fabius had receyved £of Hanybal certeyn prysoners £that he helde of the Romayns £for a certeyn somme of money, £whiche he promysed to paye £to the sayd Hanybal.
And whan he cam £unto the senatours of Rome £and desyred to have the money lente for hem, £they answerd that they wold not paye nor lene.
And than Fabius sent his sone to Rome £and made hym £to selle hys heritage and patrymonye, £and sent the money £that he receyvyd therof unto Hanybal, £and had lever and lovyd better £to be poure £in his contréy of heritage £than of beleve and fayth.
 But in thyse dayes £it were grete folye £to have suche affyaunce £in moche peple £but yf they had ben prevyd afore. £For oftentymes men truste in them £by whom they ben deceyvyd £at theyr nede.
And it is to wete £that these crafty men and werkmen £ben soveraynly proffytable unto the world.
And wythout artificers and werkmen, £the world myght not be governed.
And knowe thou verily £that alle tho thynges £that ben engendrid £on the erthe £and on the see ben maad £and formed for to do proffyt £unto the lignage of man, £for man was formed £for to have generacion £that the men myght helpe £and proffyt eche other.
And here in ought we to folowe nature, £for she sheweth to us £that we shold do comyn proffyt, £one to another.
And the first fondement of justyce £is that no man shold noye ne greve other, £but that they ought do the comen proffyt.
For men say in reproche, £“That I see of thyn, £I hope hit shal be myn."
But who is he in thyse dayes £that entendeth more to the comyn proffyt £than to his owne? £Certeynly none.
But alwey a man £ought to have drede and fere £of his owne hows £whan he seeth his £neyghbour’s hows afyre.
And therfore ought men £gladly helpe the comyn prouffyt, £for men otherwhyle sette not £by a lytyl fyre £and myght quenche hit in the begynnyng £that afterward maketh a grete blasygng fire.
And fortune hath of nothyng £so grete plesure £as for to torne and werke alwey.
And nature is so noble a thyng £that whereas she is, £she wyl susteyne and kepe.
But thys rewle of nature £hath faylled longe tyme.
How wel that the decree saith £that alle the thynges £that been ayenst the lawe of nature £ought to be taken awey £and put aparte.
And he sayth tofore £in the eighth distinccion £that the ryght lawe of nature defferenceth £ofte tymes fro custom and statutes establisshyd.
For by lawe of nature £al thyng ought £to be comyn to every man.
And thys lawe was of olde tyme.
And men wene yet specially £that the Trojans kept this lawe, £and we rede that the multitude of the Trojans £was one herte and one sowle.
And verayly we fynde £that in tyme passid £the philosophres dide the same.
And also, it is to be supposid £that suche as have theyr goodes comune £and not propre is most acceptable to God.
For ellis wold not thyse £religyous men £as monkes, freres, chanons, observauntes, £and al other avowe hem £and kepe the wylful poverté 
that they ben professyd to? £For in trouth I have myself £ben conversaunt in a religious hows £of Whyt Freres at Gaunt, £whiche have al thyng £in comyn among them, £and not one richer than another, £insomoche that yf a man gaf £to a frere three pence or four pence £to praye for hym in his masse, £as sone as the masse is don, £he delyveryeth hit £to his overest or procuratour, £in whiche hows ben many vertuous and devout freris.
And yf that lyf were not the best £and the most holyest, £Holy Chirche wold never suffre hit in religyon.
And accordyng therto, £we rede in Plato, £whiche sayth £that the cyté is wel £and justly governed and ordeyned £in the which no man may say £by right, by custome, ne by ordenaunce, £“Thys is myn."
But I say to thee certeynly £that sythen this custome £came forth to say £“This is myn, £and this is thyn," £no man thought £to preferre the comyn prouffyt £so moche as his owne. £And al werkmen ought to be wyse £and wel advysed £so that they have none envye £ne none evyll suspecion one to another.
For God wyl £that our humayn nature be covetous of two thynges, £that is of religyon £and of wysedom. £But in this caas ben £somme often tymes deceyved.
For they take often tymes religyon £and leve wysedom, £and they take wysedom £and refuse religion.
And none may be veray £and trewe wythout other.
For it apperteyneth £not to a wyse man £to do onythyng £that he may repente hym of hit, £and he ought to do nothyng £ayenst his wylle £but to do al thyng nobly, £meurely, fermely, and honestly.
And yf he have envye upon ony, £hit is folye, £for he on whom he hath envye £is more honest £and of more havoyr £than he whiche is so envyous.
For a man may have none envye on another, £but bycause he is more fortunat £and hath more grace than hymself.
For envye is a sorowe of corage £that cometh of this ordenaunce £of the prouffyt of another man.
And knowe thou verily £that he that is ful of bounté 
shal never have envye of another.
But the envyous man seeth £and thynketh alwey £that every man is more noble £and more fortunat that hymself, £and saith alwey to hymself, £“That man wynneth more than I!" £and “Myn neyghbours have more plenté of bestes!" £and “Her thynges multeplye more than myn!" £And therfore thou oughtest knowe £that envye is the most grettest dedely synne £that is, for she tormenteth hym £that hath her within hym £wythout tormentyng or doyng ony harme to hym £on whom he hath envye.
And an envyous man £hath no vertu in hymself, £for he corrumpeth hymself, £for as moche as he hateth £alwey the welthe and vertues of other.
And thus ought they to kepe them £that they take none evyl suspecion.
For a man naturelly, £whan his affeccion hath suspecion in ony man £that he weneth £that he doth, £hit semeth to hym veryly £that it is don.
And it is an evyl thyng £for a man £to have suspecion on hymself.
For we rede that Dyonyse of Zecyle, a tyraunt, £was so suspecious £that he had so grete fere and drede.
For as moche as he was hated of alle men, £that he put his frendes £out of theyr offyces £that they had and put other straungers in their places £for to kepe his body, £and chese suche £as were right cruel and felons.
And for fere and doubte of the barbours, £he made his doughters £to lerne shave and kembe.
And whan they were grete, £he wold not they £shold use ony yron £to be occupyed by them £but to brenne and senge his heeris, £and menaced them £and durst not truste in them.
And in like wyse £they had none affyaunce in hym.
And also, he did do envyronne £the place where he lay £wyth grete dyches and brode lyke a castel.
And he entrid by a drawe bridge, £whiche closid after hym.
And his knyghtes laye £wythout wyth his gardes, £whiche watched and kept £straytly thys forteresse.
And whan Plato sawe thys said Dionyse, £Kyng of Zecille, £thus envyroned and sette about £wyth gardes and watchemen £for the cause of his suspescion, £sayd to hym openly £tofore alle men, £“Kynge, why hast thou don £so moche evyl and harme £that thee behoveth to be kept £wyth so moche peple? £And therfore I say £that it apperteyneth not to ony man £that wylle truly behave hymself £in his werkes £to be suspecious. £" 
And also, they ought £to be stronge and seure £in theyr werkys.
And specially they £that ben maysters and maronners £on the see.
For yf they be tumerous and ferdful, £they shold make aferde them £that ben in theyr shippis £that knowe not the parilles.
And so hit myght happen that £by that drede and fere, £al men shold leve theyr labour, £and so they myght be perisshed and dispeyrid £in theyr corages.
For a shyppe is soon perisshed and lost £by a litil tempest £whan the governour faylleth £to governe his shyppe for drede £and can geve no counceyl to other.
Thenne it is no mervaylle £though they be aferde £that ben in his governaunce.
And therfore ought to be £in them strengthe, force, and corage, £and [they] ought £to considere the paryls £that myght falle.
And the governour specially ought £not to doubte.
And yf hyt happyn £that ony parril falle, £he ought to promyse £to the other good hoop. £And hit aperteyneth £wel that a man of good and hardy corage £be sette in that office, £in suche wyse £that he have ferme £and seure mynde £ayenst the parylles £that oft tymes happen in the see.
And wyth this ought the maronners £have good and ferme creaunce £and beleve in God, £and to be of good recomforte £and of fayr langage unto them £that he governeth £in suche parellys.
And thys suffyseth to you £as touchyng the labourers.
The thyrd chappytre £of the thyrd book treteth £of the office of notaries, advocates, skryvenars, and drapers or clothmakers.
Capitulo tercio.
The third pawn, £whiche is sette £tofore the alphyn on the right syde, £ought to be fygured as a clerke.
And hit is reson that he shold so be.
For as moche as emonge the comune peple £of whom we speke in this boke £they plete the differences, contencions, and causes, £otherwhyle the whiche £behoveth the alphyns £to geve sentence £and juge as juges.
And hit is reson £that the alphyn or juge £have his notarye, £by whom the processe may be wreton.
And this pawn ought to be maad £and figured in this manere.
He must be made like a man £that holdeth £in his right hand £a payr of sheris or forcettis, £and in the lyfte hand a grete knyf, £and on his gurdel a penner and an ynkhorn, £and on his eere a penne to wryte with.
And that been the instrumentis and the offyces £that been maad and putte £in wrytyng autentique, £and ought to have passyd £tofore the juges as libelles, writes, condempnacions, and sentences.
And that is signefied £by the scripture and the penne. £And on that other parte, £hit aperteyneth to them £to cutte clothe, £shere, dyght, and dye.
And that is signefyed £by the forcettis or sheris.
And the other ought to shave berdis £and kembe the heeris.
And the other ben coupers, coryers, tawyers, skynners, bouchers, and kordwanners.
And these ben signefyed £by the knyf £that he holdeth £in hys hand.
And somme of thyse forsayd crafty men £been named drapers or clothmakers, £for so moche as they werke with wolle.
And the notaries, skynnars, coryours, and cordwaners werke £by skynnes and hydes £as perchymyn, velume, peltrie, and cordewan.
And the tayllours, £cutters of cloth, £wevars, fullars, dyers, £and many other craftes £ocupye and use wulle.
And al thyse crafty men, £and many other that I have not named, £ought to do theyr craft and mestier, £where as they ben duly ordeyned £curiously and trewly.
Also, there ought to be £amonge thyse crafty men £amyable companye and trewe, £honest contenaunce, £and trouthe in theyr wordes.
And hit is to wete £that the notaryes ben ryght prouffytable £and ought £to be good and trewe £for the comyn.
And they ought to kepe them £from appropryyng to them self £that thyng that aperteyneth to the comyn.
And yf they be good to themself, £they ben good to other.
And yf they be evyl for themself, £they ben evyl for other.
And the processes that ben maad £tofore the juges ought £to ben wreton and passyd by them.
And it is to wete £that by their writyng in the processis £may come moche prouffit.
And also, yf they wryte otherwyse £than they ought to doo, £may ensewe moche harme and domage £to the comyn.
Therfore ought they to take good hede £that they chaunge not, £ne corumpe in no wise, £the content of the sentence.
For than ben they first forsworne £and ben bounden £to make amendis to them £that by their trecherye they have endomaged.
And also ought they to rede, visite, £and to knowe the statutes, ordenaunces, £and the lawes of the citees £of the contré 
where they dwelle and enhabite.
And they ought £to considere £yf there be onythyng therin conteyned £ayenst right and reson.
And yf they fynde onythynge contraire, £they ought to admoneste £and warne them £that governe that suche thynges £may be chaunged in to better estate.
For custume establisshed £ayenst good maners £and ageynst the fayth £ought not to be holden by ryght.
For as hit is sayd £in the decree £in the chappytre £tofore all ordenaunce maad £ayenst right ought to be holden for nought. £Alas, who is now that advocate or notarye £that hath charge to wryte £and kepe sentence £that putteth his entente £to kepe more the comyn prouffyt £or as moche as his owen! £But alle drede of God is put aback, £and they deceyve the symple men £and drawen them £to the courtes disordenatly, £and constrayne them to swere £and make othes not covenable.
And in assemblyng the peple thus togyder, £they make mo traysons in the cytees £thenne they make good alyaunces.
And otherwhile they deceyve theyr soverayns, £whan they may do hit covertly.
For there is nothyng at this day £that so moche greveth Rome and Italie £as doth the College of Notaryes and Advocates Publique, £for they ben not of one accorde.
Alas! £And in Engelond, £what hurte doon the advocates, £men of lawe, £and attorneyes of court £to the comyn peple of the royame, £as wel in the spirituel lawe £as in the temporalle! £How torne they the lawe and statutes £at their plesure! £How ete they the peple! £How enpovere they the comynté! £I suppose that in alle Cristendom £are not so many pletars, attorneys, £and men of the lawe £as been in Englond onely.
For yf they were nombrid, £alle that longe £to the courtes of the chaunserye, £kynge’s benche, £comyn place, cheker, ressayt, and helle, £and the bagge berars of the same, £hit shold amounte to a grete multitude.
And how al thyse lyve and of whom, £yf hit shold be uttrid and tolde, £hit shold not be belevyd, £for they entende to theyr synguler wele and prouffyt £and not to the comyn.
How wel they ought to be £of good wyl togyder, £and admoneste and warne the cytees, £eche in his right in suche wyse £that they myght have pees and love, £one wyth another.
And Tullyus saith £that frendshyp and good wylle £that one ought to have ayenst another £for the wele of hym £that he loveth, £with the semblable wylle of hym, £ought to be put forth £tofore al other thynges.
And ther is nothyng £so resemblyng and lyke to the bees £that maken hony £ne so covenable £in prosperité and in adversité, £as is love.
For by love, £gladly the bees holden them togyder, £and yf ony trespace to that other, £anone they renne £upon the malefactour £for to punysshe hym.
And veray trewe love faylleth £never for wele ne for evyl.
And the most swete £and the most comfortyng thyng is £for to have a frend £to whom a man may say his secret, £as wel as to hymself.
But verayly, amytye and frendshyp £is somtyme founded £upon somme thyng delectable.
And this amytie cometh of yongthe, £in the which dwellith a disordynate hete.
And otherwhile, £amytie is founded £upon honesté.
And this amytie is vertuous, £of the whiche Tullyus saith £that there is an amytie vertuous £by the whiche a man ought to do £to his frende £al that he requyreth by reason.
For for to do to hym a thyng dishonest, £it is ayenst the nature £of veray frendshyp and amytye.
And thus for frendshyp £ne for favour a man £ought not to doo onythyng unresonable £ayenst the comyn prouffyt, £ner agaynst his fayth, £ne ageynst his othe.
For yf alle tho thynges £that the frendes desyre and requyre £were accomplisshed and doon, £hyt shold seme £that they shold be dyshoneste conivracions, £and they myght £otherwhyle more greve and hurte £than proffyte and ayde.
And herof sayth Seneque £that amytye is of suche wylle £as the frende wylle, £and to refuse £that ought to be refused by reason.
And yet he saith more, £that a man ought to alowe £and preise his frend £tofore the peple, £and to correcte and to chastyse hym pryvely, £for the lawe of amytie is suche.
For a man ought not to demaunde £ner do to be doon £to hys frende no vylayns thyng £that ought to be kept secrete.
And Valerian sayth £that it is a foule thynge £and an evyl excusasion £yf a man confesse £that he hath doon ony evyl £for his frende ayenst right and reason.
And sayth that there was a good man named Taffyle, £whiche herde one his frende £requyre of hym a thynge dishoneste, £whiche he denyed £and wold not do.
And than his frende said £to hym in grete despyte, £“What nede have I £of thy frendship and amytee £whan thou wilt not do that thyng £that I requyre of thee?" £And Taffile answerd to hym, £“What nede have I of the frendship £and of the amyte of thee, £yf I shold do £for thee thyng dishonest?" £And thus love is founded £otherwhile upon good prouffytable, £and this love endureth £as longe as he seeth his prouffyt.
And herof men say a comyn proverbe in Englond, £that love lasteth £as longe as the money endurith, £and whan the money failleth £than there is no love.
And Varro rehercith in his sommes £that the riche men ben al lovyd by this love, £for their frendes £ben like as the huske £whiche is about the grayn.
And no man may prove his frende £so wel as in adversité 
or whan he is poure, £for the veray trewe frende fayleth £at no nede.
And Seneque saith that somme £folowe the emperour for riches, £and so don the flies the hony £for the swetenes, £and the wolf the carayn.
And thyse companye folowe the praye £and not the man. £And Tullyus sayth £that Tarquyn the Proud £had a nevewe of his suster, £whiche was named Brutus, £and this nevewe £had banysshed Tarquin out of Rome £and had sent hym in exyle.
And than sayd he fyrst £that he parceyved and knewe his frendes £whyche were trewe and untrewe, £and that he never perceyved afore tyme £whan he was puyssaunt £for to do theyr wylle, £and sayd wel that the love £that they had to hym endured not £but as longe as hit was £to them prouffytable.
And therfore ought al the riche men £of the world take hede, £be they kynges, prynces, or duckes, £to what people they doo prouffyt £and how they may and ought be lovyd £of theyr peple.
For Cathon sayth in his book, £“See to whom thou gevest.
And thys love whiche is founded £upon theyr prouffit, £whiche fayleth and endureth not, £may better be callid and sayd ‘marchaundyse’ 
than love.
For yf we repute this love £to our prouffyt onely, £and nothyng to the prouffyt of hym £that we love, £it is more marchaundyse than love, £for he byeth our love £for the prouffyt £that he doth to us."
And therfore sayth £the versefier thyse two versis: £“Tempore felici multi numerantur amici / £Cum fortuna perit £nullus amicus erit," £whiche is to say in Englissh that £“as longe as a man is ewrous and fortunat, £he hath many frendes, £but whan fortune torneth and perissheth, £there abydeth not to hym one frende."
And of thys love ben loved the £medowes, feldes, trees, £and the bestys £for the prouffyt £that men take of them.
But the love of the men £ought to be charité, £veray gracious and pure £by good fayth.
And the veray trewe frendes ben knowen £in pure adversité.
And Piers Alphons sayth £in his Book of Moralité 
that there was a phylosophre in Arabye £that had an onely sone, £of whom he demaunded £what frendes £he had goten hym in his lyf.
And he answerd that he had many. £And his fader sayd to hym, £“I am an olde man, £and yet coude I never fynde £but one frende in al my lyf.
And I trowe verely £that it is no lytyl thyng £for to have a frende, £and hit is wel gretter £and more a man to have many.
And hit apperteyneth £and behoveth a man to assaye £and preve his frende £or he have nede."
And thenne commaunded the philosopher his sone £that he shold goo £and slee a swyne £and put hit in a sacke, £and fayne that it were a man dede £that he had slayn, £and bere hit £to his frendes £for to burye hit secretly.
And whan the sone had don £as his fader £commaunded hym, £and had requyred his frendes one after another £as afore is sayd, £they denyed hym £and answerd to hym £that he was a vylayne £to requyre and desire of them thyng £that was so perilous.
And than he came agayn £to his fader £and sayd to hym £how he had requyred al his frendes, £and that he had not founden one £that wold helpe hym in his nede.
And than his fader sayd to hym £that he shold goo £and requyre his frende, £whyche had but one, £and requyre hym £that he shold helpe hym in his nede.
And whan he had requyred hym, £anone he put out al his mayné 
out of hys hows.
And whan they were £out of the waye or aslepe, £he dyd do make secretly a pytte in the grounde.
And whan hit was redy £and wold have buryed the body, £he founde hit an hogge or a swyne, £and not a man.
And thus this sone prevyd this man £to be a veray, £trewe frende of his fader, £and prevyd that his frendes £were fals frendes of fortune.
And yet reherceth £the sayd Piers Alphons £that there were two marchauntes, £one of Bandach £and that other of Egypt, £whiche were so joyned togeder £by so grete frendshyp £that he of Bandache cam on a tyme £for to se hys frende in Egypt, £of whom he was receyvyd right honuurably.
And this marchaunt of Egypt had £in his hows a fayre yonge mayden £whom he shold have had £in mariage to hymself, £of the whiche mayde thys marchaunt of Bandach £was esprised with her love £so ardantly that he was right seek, £and that men supposid hym to dye.
And than the other dyd do come the phisisiens, £whiche sayd that in hym was no sekenes £sauf passyon of love.
Thenne he axyd of the seek man £yf there were ony woman in hys hows £that he loved and maad al the women £of his hows £to come tofore hym.
And than he chees her £that shold have ben £that other’s wyf £and sayd that he was seek for her.
Than his frende sayd to hym, £“Frende, comforte yourself.
For trewly I gyve her to you to wyf £with alle the dowaire £that is gyven to me wyth her. £" 
And had lever to suffre £to be wythout wyf £than to lese the body of his frende.
And than he of Bandach wedded the mayde £and went with his wyf £and with his richesse ageyn £in to his contré.
And after this, £anone after, hit happend £that the marchaunt of Egypt £became so poure £by evyl fortune £that he was constreyned to seche £and begge his breed by the contray, £in so moche that he cam to Bandach.
And whan he entrid in to the toun, £hit was derk nyght £that he coude not fynde the hows £of his frende £but went and lay thys nyght £in an olde temple.
And on the morne, £whan he shold yssue out of the temple, £the offycers of the toun arestyd hym £and sayd that he was an homycide £and had slayn a man £whiche lay there dede.
And anone he confessid hyt £wyth a good wylle, £and had lever to ben hangyd £than to dye £in that myserable and pour lyf £that he suffryd.
And thus whan he was brought to jugement, £and sentence shold have ben gyven £ayenst hym £as an homycide, £his frend of Bandach cam £and sawe hym, £and anone knewe £that thys £was his good frende of Egypte.
And forthwyth stepte in £and sayd that he hymself £was culpable £of the deth of this man £and not that other, £and enforcid hym £in alle maners £for to delyver and excuse that other.
And than whan that he that had doon the feet £and had slayne the man sawe this thyng, £he considerid in hymself £that these two men were innocent of thys feet.
And doubtyng the dyvyne jugement, £he came tofore the juge £and confessyd al the feet by ordre.
And whan the juge sawe £and herde al thys mater, £and also the causes, £he considered the ferme and trewe love £that was betwene the two frendes, £and understood the cause £why that one wold save that other, £and the trouth of the fayte of the homycide.
And than he pardoned al the feet £hooly and entierly.
And after, £the marchaunt of Bandach £brought hym of Egipt £wyth hym in to his hows, £and gaf to hym his sister in mariage, £and departed to hym half his goodes.
And so bothe of hem were riche, £and thus were they bothe £veray faythful and trewe frendes.
Furthermore, notaries, men of lawe, £and crafty men £shold and ought to love eche other, £and also ought to be contynent, chaste, and honeste.
For by theyr craftes £they ought so to be by necessyté.
For they converse and accompanye them £ofte tyme wyth women.
And therfore hit apperteyneth to them £to be chaste and honeste.
And that they meve not the women, £nor entyse them to lawghe and jape £by ony dysordynate ensignes or tokenes.
Titus Livius reherceth that the philosopher Democreon £dyd doo put out his eyen £for as moche £as he myght not beholde the women £wythoute flesshly desyre.
And how wel it is sayd £before that he dyd hit £for other certeyn cause.
Yet was this one of the pryncipal causes.
And Valerian tellyth £that there was a yong man of Rome £of right excellent beaulté.
And how wel that he was right chaste, £for as moche as his beaulté 
mevyd many women to desire hym, £insomoche that he understood £that the parentes £and frendes of them £had suspecion in hym, £he dyd his vysage £to be kutte £wyth a knyf and lancettis, £endlong and everthwart £for to deforme his vysage, £and had lever have a fowle vysage £and disformed £than the beauté of his vysage £shold meve other to synne.
And also we rede £that there was a nonne, a virgyne, £dyd do put out bothe her eyen, £for as moche as the beauté of her eyen £mevyd a kyng to love her, £whyche eyen she sente £to the kyng in a present.
And also we rede that Plato, £the right ryche phylosopher, £lefte his owne lande and contré, £and chase his mansion £and dwellyng in Achadomye, £a toun whiche was not onely destroyed £but also was ful of pestelence, £so that by the cure and charge and customaunce of sorowe £that he there suffrid £myght eschewe the hetes £and occasions of lecherye.
And many of hys dysciples dyd in lyke wyse.
Helemand reherceth £that Demostenes the philosopher laye ones £by a noble woman £for his dysporte, £and playeng wyth her, £he demaunded of her £what he shold geve £to have to doo wyth her.
And she answerd to hym, £“A thousand pens."
And he sayd ageyn to her, £“I shold repente me £to bye hit so dere."
And whan he advysed hym that, £he was so sore chauffyd £to speke to her £for to accomplisshe his flesshly desyre, £he despoyled hym £al nakyd and wente £and put hym £in the myddes of the snowe.
And Ovyde rehercith £that thys thynge £is the leste that maye helpe £and most greve the lovers.
And therfore Saynt Augustyn rehercith £in his book, £De civitate dei, £that there was a right noble Romayn named Marculian £that wan and took the noble cité of Siracuse.
And tofore, er he dyd doo £assayle hit or befight hit, £and or he had do beshedde ony blood, £he wepte and shedde many teeris £tofore the cité.
And that was for the cause £that he doubted £that his peple £shold defoule and corumpe £to moche dishonestly the chastyté 
of the toun, £and ordeyned upon payn of deth £that no man £shold be so hardy £to take and defoyle ony woman £by force what that ever she were.
After thys, £the crafty men ought to understonde £for to be trewe £and to have trouth in her mouthes, £and that theyr dedes £folowe theyr wordes.
For he that sayth one thyng £and doth another, £he condempneth hymself £by his word.
Also, they ought to see wel £to that they be of one accorde in good, £by entente, by word, and by dede, £so that they be not discordaunt £in no caas, £but that every man have pure verité 
and trouth in hymself.
For God Hymself is pure verité.
And men say comynly £that trouth seketh £none hernes, ne corners.
And trouth is a vertu £by the whiche alle drede £and fraude is put awey.
Men saye trewly £whan they saye that they knowe, £and they that knowe not trouthe £ought to knowe hyt £and alwey use trouthe.
For Saynt Austyn sayth £that they that wene to knowe trouth £and lyveth evyl and vyciously, £it is folye £yf he knoweth hit not.
And also, he sayth in another place £that it is better £to suffre payn for trouth £than for to have a benefete £by falsnes or by flaterye.
And man that is callyd a beste resonable, £and doth not his werkys £after reson and trouthe, £is more bestyal than ony beste brute.
And knowe ye that for to come £to the trouthe hit cometh £of a resonable forsight in his mynde.
And lyeng cometh of an oultrageous £and contrarie thought in hys mynde.
For he that lyeth £wittyngly knoweth £wel that hit £is ageynst the trouthe £that he thynketh.
And herof speketh Saynt Bernard £and sayth that the mouth £that lyeth £destroyeth the sowle.
And yet sayth Saynt Austyn in another place, £“For to say one thynge £and do the contrarye maketh doctryne suspecious."
And knowe ye verily £that for to lye £is a right perilous thynge £to body and sowle.
For the lye that the auncient enemye £maad Eve and Adam £to beleve hym, £made hem for to be dampned £with alle their lignage £to the deth pardurable, £and made hem to be cast £out of paradyse terrestre.
For he maad them to beleve £that God had not forboden them the fruyt £but onely bycause they shold not knowe £that her Mayster knewe.
But how wel that the devyl sayd thyse wordes £yet had he double entente £to hem bothe.
For they knewe anone £as they had tastyd of the fruyt £that they were dampned £to the deth pardurable.
And God knewe hit wel tofore.
But they supposid wel £to have knowen many other thynges £and to be lyke £unto his knowleche and science. £And therfore saith Saynt Poule £in a pistyl: £“Hit ne apperteyneth to saver or knowe more £than behoveth to saver or knowe, £but to saver or knowe £by mesure or sobrenes. £" 
And Valerian rehercith £that there was a good woman of Siracusane £that wold not lye £unto the Kyng of Secille, £whyche was named Dyonyse.
And this kyng was so ful of tyrannye £and so cruel £that alle the world £desired his deth and cursid hym, £sauf this woman onely, £whiche was so olde £that she had seen £three or four kynges reignyng in the contré.
And every mornyng, £as sone as she was rysen, £she prayed to God £that he wold gyve £unto the tyraunt good lyf and longe £and that she myght never see his deth.
And whan the Kyng Dyonyse knewe this, £he sent for her £and mervaylled moche herof, £for he knewe wel £that he was sore behated, £and demaunded her £what cause mevyd hyr £to praye for hym.
And she answerd and sayd to hym, £“Sir, £whan I was a mayde, £we had a right evyl tyraunt to our kyng, £of whom we coveyted sore the deth.
And whan he was dede, £there came after hym a werse, £of whom we coveyted also the deth.
And whan we were delyveryd of hym, £thou camest to be our lord, £which art worst of al other.
And now I doubte yf we have one after thee £he shal be worse than thou art. £And therfore I shal praye for thee."
And whan Dyonyse understood £that she was so hardy in sayeng the trouth, £he durst not do torment her for shame £by cause she was so olde.
The fourth chappitre £of the third book tretith £of the maner of the fourth pawn £and of the marchauntis or chaungers.
Capitulo quarto.
The fourth pawn is sette tofore the kyng £and is formed in the forme of a man holdyng £in his right hand a balaunce £and the weyght in the lyft hand, £and tofore hym a table, £and at his gurdel a purse £ful of money redy for to geve £to them that requyred hit.
And by thys peple ben signefyed £the marchauntes of cloth, lynnen, and wollen, £and of al other marchaundyses.
And by the table that is tofore hym £is signefyed the chaungers £and they that lene money.
And they that bye and selle £by the weyght ben signefyed £by the balaunces and weyghtes.
And the customers, tollars, £and receyvours of rentes £and of money £ben signefyed by the purse.
And knowe ye that £alle they that ben signefied £by this peple £ought to flee avarice and covetyse, £and eschewe brekyng £of the dayes of payment, £and ought to holde and kepe theyr promyses, £and ought also to rendre and restore £that that is gyven to them to kepe.
And therfore hit is reson £that this peple be set £tofore the kyng, £for as moche as they signefye the receyvours £of the tresours ryal £that ought alwey £to be redy £tofore the kyng, £and to answer for hym £to the knyghtes £and to other persones £for theyr wages and souldyes.
And therfore have I said £that they ought to flee avarice, £for avarice is as moche to say £as an adourer £or as worshypar of fals ymages.
And herof sayth Tullyus £that avarice is a covetise £to gete that thyng £that is above necessité.
And it is a love disordynate £to have onythyng, £and it is one of the werst thynges £that is, £and specially to prynces £and to them £that governe the thynges of the comuneté.
And this vyce causeth a man to do evyll, £and thys doyng evyl £is whan hit reygneth £in olde men.
And herof sayth Seneque £that all worldly thynges £ben mortefyed and appetissed £in olde men, £reservyd avarice onely, £whyche alwey abydeth wyth hym £and dyeth with hym.
But I understonde not wel the cause £wherof this cometh £ne wherfore hit may be.
And hit is a fowle thyng £and contrarye to reson £that whan a man is £at the ende of his journey £for to lengthe his viage £and to ordeyne more vitayl £than hym behoveth.
And this may wel be likned £to the avaricious wolf, £for the wolf doth never good £tyl he be dede.
And thus it is sayd £in the proverbys of the wyse men £that the avaricious man £doth no good £tyl that he be deed, £and he desireth nothynge £but to lyve long in thys synne.
For the covetous man certeynly £is not good for onythyng, £for he is evyl to hymself £and to the riche and to the poure, £and fyndeth cause £to gaynsay theyr desire.
And herof rehercith Seneque, £and sayth that Antigonus £was a covetous prynce.
And whan Tynque, £whiche was his frende, £requyred of hym a besaunt, £he answerd to hym £that he demaunded more £than hyt apperteyned to hym.
And than Tynque, £constrayned by grete necessité, £axid and requyred of hym a peny.
And he answerd to hym £that it was no yefte covenable £for a kyng.
And so he was alwey redy £to fynde £a cause nought to geve, £for he myght have gyven to hym a besaunt £as a kynge £to his frende £and the peny £as to a poure man.
And ther is nothyng so litil £but that the humanyté of a kyng £may geve hyt.
Avarice ful of covetise £is a maner of al vices of luxurye.
And Josephus rehercith £in the Book of Auncient Histories £that ther was in Rome £a right noble lady named Paulyne, £and was of the most noble of Rome, £right honest for the noblesse of chastité, £whiche was maryed in the tyme £that the wommen glorefyed them £in theyr chastyté 
unto a yonge man, fayr, noble, £and riche above al other, £and was lyke and semblable £to his wyf in al caasis.
And thys Pawlyne was belovyd £of a knyght namyd Enymerancian £and was so ardantly esprised in her love £that he sent to her £many right riche yeftes £and made to her many grete promyses.
But he myght never torne the herte of her, £which was on her syde £also colde and harde as marbyll.
But she had lever £to refuse his yeftes £and hys promyses £than to entende to covetyse £and to lose her chastyté.
And we rede also £in the Histories of Rome £that there was a noble lady of Rome £whiche lyved a solytarye lyf £and was chaste and honeste, £and had gadrid togeder £a grete somme of golde, £and had hyd hit in the erthe £in a pytte £wythin her hows.
And whan she was deed, £the bisshop dyd do burye her £in the chirche £wel and honestly.
And anone after, £this gold was founden £and born to the bysshop.
And the bisshop had to caste hit £in to the pytte £where she was buryed.
And thre dayes men herd her crye £and make grete noyse, £and say that she brenned £in grete payn, £and they herd her ofte tymes £thus tormentid in the chirche.
The neyghbours went unto the bysshop £and tolde hym therof, £and the bisshop gaf hem leve £to open the sepulcre.
And whan they had openyd hit, £they fonde al the golde molten £with fire ful of sulphre, £and was poured and put in her mouth.
And they herd one say, £“Thou desiredest this gold by covetyse! £Take hyt and drynke hyt!" £And thenne they took the body £out of the tombe.
And hit was cast out £in a prevy place.
Seneque rehercith £in the Boook of the Cryes of Women £that avaryce is foundement of alle vyces.
And Valerian rehercith £that avarice is a ferdful garde £or kepar of richessis, £for he that hath on hym £or in his kepyng moche money £or other richessis £is alwey aferd £to lose hit £or to be robbid £or to be slayn therfore.
And he is not ewrous ner happy £that by covetise getith hit.
And al the evyls of this vice of avarice £had a man of Rome named Septenulle, £for he was a frend of one named Tarchus.
And this Septenulle brent so sore and so cruelly £in this synne of covetise £that he had no shame to smyte £of the hede of hys frend by trayson, £for as moche as one Framosian had promysed to hym £as moche weyght of pure gold £as the heed wayed.
And he bare the said heed £upon a staf thrugh the cité of Rome, £and he voyded the brayn out therof £and filled hyt ful of leed £for to weye the hevyar.
This was a right horrible and cruel avarice.
Ptolomé, Kyng of Egipciens, £poursewed avarice in another manere.
For whan Anthonie, £Emperour of Rome, £sawe that he was right riche £of gold and silver, £he had hym in grete hate £and tormentid hym right cruelly.
And whan he shold perissh £bycause of his richessis, £he toke al his havoir £and put hyt in a shippe, £and went withalle £into the hye see to the ende £for to drowne and perissh there £the shippe and his richesses £bycause Anthonye, his enemye, £shold not have hit.
And whan he was there, £he durst not perisshe hit, £ner myght not fynde in hys herte £to departe from hit, £but cam and brought hit agayn £into his hows, £where he receyvyd £the rewarde of deth therfore.
And without doubte he was not lord of the richesse, £but the richesse was lady over hym.
And therfore hit is said in proverbe £that a man ought to seignorie £over the riches, £and not for to serve hit.
And yf thou canst dewly use thy richesse, £than she is thy chamberer.
And yf thou cannot departe from hit £and use hit honestly £at thy plesure, £knowe verily that she is thy lady.
For the riches never satisfyeth the covetous, £but the more he hath, £the more he desireth.
And Saluste saith that avarice destroubleth fayth, £poesté, honesté, £and al thise other good vertues, £and taketh for thyse vertues pryde, cruelté, £and to forgete God, £and sayth that al thynges be vendable.
And after this, £they ought to be ware £that they lene not to moche, £ner make so grete creaunces £by whiche they may falle in poverté.
For Saynt Ambrose saith upon Thoby: £“Poverté hath no lawe, £for to owe, hit is a shame, £and to owe and not paye £is a more shame.
Yf thou be poure, £beware how thou borowest and thynke £how thou mayst paye £and rendre agayn.
Yf thou be riche, £thou hast no nede £to borowe and axe." £And it is said £in the proverbis £that hit is fraude £to take that thou wylt not ner mayst 
[not] rendre and paye agayn.
And also, hit is sayd in reproche: £“Whan I lene, £I am thy frende, £and whan I axe, £I am thyn enemye," £as who saith God £at the lenyng £and the devyll atte rendryng.
And Seneke saith in his auctorités £that they that gladly borowe ought gladly to paye, £and ought to surmounte in corage £to love hem the better £bycause they lene hem and ayde hem in her nede.
For benefetes £and good tornes don £to a man ought to gyve hym £thankynges therfore, £and moche more ought a man to repaye £that is lent hym in his nede.
But now in these dayes £many men by lenyng £of their money have made £of their frendes enemyes.
And herof speketh Domas the philosopher £and saith that, £“My frende borowed money of me, £and I have lost my frende and my money." £There was a marchaunt of Gene £and also a chaungeour whos name was Albert Ganor.
And this Albert was a man £of grete trouth and loyalté.
For on a tyme there was a man cam to hym £and sayd and affermyd £that he had delyveryd £into his banke £five honderd floryns of gold to kepe, £whiche was not trouth, £for he lyed, £whiche five honderd floryns £the sayd Albert knewe not of, £ner coude fynde in al his bookes £ony suche money £to hym due.
And this lyar coude brynge no wytnes, £but began to braye, crye, £and deffame the said Albert.
And than this Albert callyd to hym £this marchaunt and sayd, £“Dere frende, £take here five honderd florens £whiche thou affermest £and sayest £that thou hast delyverd to me." £And forthwyth tolde hem £and toke hem to hym.
And lo this good man had lever £to lose his good £than his good name and renome.
And this other marchaunt toke these florens £that he had wrongfully receyvyd £and enployed them £in dyverse marchaundyse, £in so moche that he gate and encresid and wan £with them fifteen thousand florens. £And whan he sawe £that he approched toward his deth, £and that he had no children, £he establisshed Albert £his heyr in al thynges, £and sayd that with the five honderd florens £that he had receyvyd of Albert falsely, £he had goten alle £that he had in the world.
And thus by devyne purveaunce, £he that had be a theef fraudelent £was maad afterward £a trewe procurour and atorney £of the sayd Albert.
But now in thyse dayes £there be marchauntis £that do marchaundise £with other menny’s money £whiche is taken to hem to kepe.
And whan they ben requyred £to repaye hyt, £they have no shame £to denye hit appertly.
Wherof hit happend £that ther was a marchaunt which had a good and a grete name £and renome of kepyng £wel suche thynges £as was delyveryd to hym to kepe.
But whan he sawe place and tyme, £he reteyned hit lyke a theef.
So hit befel £that a marchaunt of without forth £herd the good reporte and fame £of this man, £cam to hym, £and delyverd hym grete tresour to kepe.
And thys tresour abode three yere £in his kepyng.
And after this thre yere, £thys marchaunt came and requyred £to have his good delyverd to hym agayn.
And thys man knewe wel £that he had no recorde £ne witnes to preve on hym this dueté, £nor he had no obligacion £ne wrytyng of hym therof, £in suche wyse £that he denyed al entierly £and sayd playnly he knewe hym not.
And whan this good man herd and understood this, £he went sorowfully and wepyng from hym £so ferre and longe £that an olde woman mette wyth hym £and demaunded of hym £the cause of his wepyng.
And he sayd to her, £“Woman hit aperteyneth nothyng to thee! £Goo thy waye!" £And she prayed hym £that he wold telle her £the cause of his sorowe, £for paraventure she myght geve hym £counceyl good and proffytable.
And thenne this man tolde to her £by ordre the caas of his fortune.
And the olde woman, £that was wyse and subtil, £demaunded of hym £yf he had in that cité ony frende £whiche wold be faythful and trewe £to hym.
And he sayd £“ye," that he had dyverse frendes.
Than sayd she, £“Goo thou to them and saye to them £that they doo ordeyne £and bye dyverce cofres and chestes, £and that they doo fylle them £wyth somme olde thynges of no value, £and that they fayne and say £that they be ful £of golde, silver, and other jewels, £and of moche grete tresour.
And thenne that they brynge them £to thys sayd marchaunt, £and to say to hym £that he wold kepe them, £for as moche as they had grete trust in hym, £and also that they have herd £of his grete trouth £and good renome, £and also they wold go £into fer contré 
and shold be longe £er they retorned agayn.
And whilis they speke to hym £of this mater, £thou shalt come upon them £and requyre hym £that he doo delyver £to thee £that thou tokest to hym.
And I trowe, £bycause of tho good men £that than shal proffre to hym £the sayd tresour £and for the covetise to have hit, £he shal delyver £to thee thy good agayn.
But beware! £Late hym not knowe £they ben thy good frendes ner £of thy knowleche." £This was a grete and good counceyl £of a woman.
And verily it cometh of nature £often tymes to women £to geve counceyl shortly £and unadvysedly to thynges £that ben in doubte or perilous £and nedeth hasty remedye.
And as ye have herd, £this good man dyd, £and did after her counceyl, £and came upon them £whan they spack of the mater £to the marchaunt £for to delyver to hym £the sayd cofres to kepe, £whiche his frendes had fayned, £and requyred of hym £that he had taken to hym to kepe.
And than anone £the sayd marchaunt sayd to hym, £“I knowe thee now wel.
For I have advysed me £that thou art suche a man, £and camest to me suche a tyme, £and delyvered to me suche a thynge £whyche I have wel kept. £" 
And thenne callyd his clerk £and bad hym goo fetche suche a thyng £in suche a place £and delyver hit £to that good man, £“for he delyverd hit to me. £" 
And than the good man receyvyd his good £and went his waye right joyously and glad.
And this marchaunt trichour and deceyvour was defrauded £from his evyl malice.
And he ne had neyther that one £ne that other onythyng £that was of value.
And therfore hit is sayd in proverbe, £“To defraude the begiler £is no fraude." £And he that doth wel £foloweth our Lord.
And Seneke sayth £that charité enseigneth and techeth £that men shold paye wel, £for good payement £is somtyme good confessyon.
And this marchaunt trichour £and deceyvour resemblith £and is lyke to an hound £that bereth a chese in his mouth £whan he swymmeth over a water.
For whan he is on the watre, £he seeth the shadowe of the chese £in the watre, £and than he weneth hit be another chese.
And for covetyse to have that, £he openyth his mouth £to catche that.
And than the chese £that he bare fallith doun £into the watre, £and thus he loseth bothe two.
And in the same wyse £was servyd thys marchaunt deceyvour.
For for to have the cofres £whiche he had not seen, £he delyverd agayn £that he wold have holden wrongfully, £and thus by his covetise £and propre malyce £he was deceyved.
And therfore hit apperteyneth £to every good and wyse man £to knowe and considere in hymself £how moche he hath receyved of other men.
And upon what condycion hit £was delyverd to hym. £And it is to wete £that thys thyng apperteyneth £to receyvours and to chaungeours, £and to alle trewe marchauntis and other, £what that somever they be, £and ought to kepe theyr bookes £of resaytes and of payementes £of whom and to whom, £and what tyme and day.
And yf ye demaunde £what thyng makyth them £to forgete suche thynges £as ben taken to them to kepe, £I answer and say £that it is grete covetise £for to have tho thynges to themself £and never to departe from them.
And hit is alle her thought and desire £to assemble alle the goodes £that they may gete, £for they beleve on none other god, £but on her richesses £theyr hertes ben so obstynat.
And this suffyseth of the marchauntes.
Othea opon the Greke may be takyn £for the wysedome £off man and woman , £and as ancient pepyll of hold tyme, £not havynge yit £at that tyme lyght of feythe, £wirchippyd many goddys, £vndyr the which lawe £be passed the hyest lordes £that hathe ben in the world, £as the reaume off Assire, £of Perse, the Grekys, the Troyens, Alexandre, the Romaynes £and many other, 
anamly the grettest philosophurs £that euer was—so £as yet at that tyme God £hade not oppenyd the ȝate off mercy, £but we Crysten men and women now £at this tyme £by the grace of God enlumynid £wyth very feyth may bryng ayene £to morall mynde the oppinyons of ancient pepyll £and thereopon many feyre allegories £may be made £—and as they hade a costom £to worchipe all thynge £the which above the comon cours of thynges £hade prerogatyue of some grace, £many wyse ladyes £in there tyme were called godesses.
And trwe it ys, £aftyr the storie, £that in the tyme £that grete Troye fflorishede £in his grete name a ful wyse ladie callede Othea, £consyderyng the ffre thought of Hector of Troye, £the which that tyme ffloryshed in vertues, £and that it be a shewynge of fortunes £to be in hym in tyme commynge, £sche sent hyme many grete £and notabil yiftys, £and namly the fayre stede £that men callyd Galathee, £the which had no felawe £in all the worlde. £And becavse that all wordly grace[s] £that a good man oughte £for to have were in Hector, £morally we may sey £that he toke theyme £by the cownsel of Othea, £the which sent hyme this pystylle.
By Othea we schall vndirstond £by the vertu of prudence £and of wysedome, £wherewyth he was arayed; £and because the Cardinal Vertues £ben necessarie to good pollicie, £we schall speke of them, £sewynge ich after othyr.
And to þe fryst we have youen £a name and takyn a maner of speche £in some wyse poetykly, £the bettyr to folewe owre matere £acordyng to the very storie, £and to owre purpoyse £we schall take some auctoritees £of ancient philosophres.
Thus we schall sey £that by the seyde lady £this present was yovyn.
Venus is a planete of heuen, £aftyr whome the Fryday is named; £and the metall £that we call tynne or pewter £is yovyn to the same.
Venus yiffeth influence £of loue and of ydylnes, £and she was a lady called soo, £the which was qwene of Cippre.
And because that [she] excedyd all women £in excellent beaute and jolynesse, £and was ryght amerous £and not stedefast in o loue, £and becawse that she yevyth influence of lecheri, £Othea seyth to the good knyght £that he make here not his godes.
This is to vndir∣stond, £that in sech lyfe he £shuld not abaundon his body ne his.
Phebe is called the mone, £off whom the Moneday hath his name; £and to hyme is yoven the metall £that we calle syluyr.
The mone resteth non oure £in a ryghte poynte £and yiffeth influens £of vnstefastenes and foly, £and therefore it is seyde £þat a goode knyght £shulde kepe hym £from which vicys.
And to this purpose Hermes seith, £"Vse wisedome and be stedefast." £Phebe is called the mone, £off whom the Moneday hath his name; £and to hyme is yoven the metall £that we calle syluyr.

CAP.
 VIII. £Þerfore now no þing of dampnacion is to hem £þat ben in Crist Jhesu, £wich wandren not aftir þe fleiȝss. £For þe lawe of þe spiritt £of lijf in Crist Jhesu haþ delyuerid me £fro þe lawe of synne, £and of deeþ. £For þat þat was vnpossible to þe lawe, £in what þing it was seek bi fleiȝss, £God sente his sone £in to þe liknesse of fleiȝssh of synne, £and of synne dampnede synne in fleiȝss; £þat þe iustifijng of þe lawe £were fulfild in vs, £þat goon not aftir þe fleiȝss, £but aftir þe spiritt. £For þei þat ben £aftir þe fleiȝss, £saueren þo þingis £þat ben of þe fleȝss; £but þei þat ben £aftir þe spiritt, £felen þo þingis þat ben of þe spiritt. £For þe prudence of fleiȝss is deeþ, £but þe prudence of spiritt £is lijf and pees. £For þe wisdam £of þe fleiȝss £is enemy to God; £for it is not sogett £to þe lawe of God, £for neþer it may. £And þei þat ben in fleiȝss, £mow not pleese to God. £But ȝe ben not in fleiȝss, £but in spiritt, £if neþeles þe spiritt of God £duelliþ in ȝou.
But if any haþ not þe spiritt of Crist, £þis is not his.
For if Crist is in ȝou, £þe bodi is deed fro synne, £but þe spiritt lifeþ £for iustifijng. £And if þe spiritt of him £þat reiside Jhesu Crist £fro deeþ duelleþ in ȝou, £he þat reisede Jhesu Crist £from deeþ shal quykene £also ȝoure deede bodies, £for þe spiritt of him £þat duelliþ in ȝou.
Þerfore, breþern, £we ben dettours, £not to þe fleiȝss £þat we lifen £aftir þe fleiȝss. £For if ȝe lifen £aftir þe fleiȝss, £ȝe shule dye; £but if ȝe bi þe spiritt sleen £þe dedis of fleiȝss, £ȝe shulen life. £For who euere ben ladde £bi þe spiritt of God, £þes ben þe sones of God. £For ȝe han not take £eftsone þe spiritt £of seruage in drede, £but ȝe han taken þe spiritt £of adopcion of sones, £in wiche we crien, Abba, fadir. £And þe þilke spiritt £ȝeldeþ wittnessing to oure spiritt, £þat we ben þe sones of God; £if sones, and eiris, and eiris of God, £and eiris togidere wiþ Crist; £if neþeles we suffren togidere, £þat also we ben glorified togidere.
And I deme þat þe passions £of þis tyme ben not worþi £to þe glorie to comynge £þat shal be shewid in vs. £For þe abiding of creature £abideþ þe shewing £of þe sones of God. £But þe creature is sogett to vanytee, not willinge, £but for him £þat made it sogett in hope; £for þe ilke creature £shal be delyuerid £fro seruage of corrupcion £in to liberte of þe glorie £of þe sones of God. £And we witen þat ech creature £sorowiþ and traueliþ £wiþ peyne til yit.
And not oonli it, £but also we vs self, £þat han þe firste fruyȝtis of þe spiritt, £and we vs self sorewen wiþ inne vs £for þe adopcion of Goddes sones, £abiding þe aȝenbijng of oure bodi.
But bi hope we ben made saaf.
For hope þat is sein, £is not hope; £for who hopeþ þat þing, £þat he seeþ? 25 £And if we hopen £þat þing þat we seen not, £we abiden bi pacience.
And also þe spiritt £helpeþ oure infirmite; £for what we shulen preie, £as it bihoueþ, £we witen not, £but þilke spiritt axiþ £for vs wiþ sorowingis £þat moun not be toolde out.
For he þat sekiþ þe hertis, £whot what þe spiritt desireþ, £for bi God he axiþ £for holie men.
And we witen, £þat to men þat louen God, £alle þingis worchen togidere £in to good, £to hem þat aftir purpos £ben clepide seintis.
For þilke þat he knew bifore, £he bifore ordeynede bi grace £to be maad lijk to þe ymage £of his sone, £þat he be þe firste bigoten £among manye briþern.
And þilke þat he bifore ordeynede to blis, £hem he clepide; £and wiche he clepide, £hem he iustifiede; £and wich he iustifiede, £and hem he gloriede. £What þanne shulen we seie to þes þingis? £If God for vs, £who is aȝens vs? £Þe wich also sparide not his owne sone, £but for vs alle bitook him, £how also ȝaf he not to vs alle þingis wiþ him? 33 £Who shal accuse aȝens £þe chosen men of God? £It is God þat iustifieþ. £Who is it þat condempneþ? £It is Jhesus Crist £þat was deed, ȝhe, £þe wiche roos aȝen, £þe wiche is on þe riȝt half of God, £and þe wiche preieþ for vs. £Who þanne shal departe vs £fro þe charite of Crist? £Tribulacion, or angwiȝss, or hungir, or nakidnesse, or persecucion, or perel, or swerd? £As it is writen, £For we ben slayne £al dai for þee, £we ben gessid as sheep of slauȝter.
But in alle þes þingis we ouercomen, £for him þat louede vs. £But I am certein, £þat neþer deeþ, £neþer lijf, £neþer aungels, £neþir principatus, £neþer vertues, £neþer present þingis, £neþer þingis to comynge, £neþer strengþe, £neþer heiȝte, £neþer depnesse, £neþer noon oþer creature £mai departe vs £fro þe charite of God, £þat is in Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
CAP. IX. £Y seie treuþe in Crist Jhesu, £Y lie not, £for my conscience beriþ wittnessing £to me in þe Holi Goost, £for greet heuynesse is to me, £and contynuel sorewe £to my herte.
For I my self desirede £to be departid £fro Crist for my breþern, £þat ben my cosyns £aftir þe fleiȝss, £þat ben men of Israel; £whos is adopcion of sones, £and glorie, and testament, £and ȝifing of þe lawe, £and seruise, and bihestis; £whos ben þe fadris, £and of wiche is Crist £aftir þe fleiȝss, £þat is God aboue alle þingis, £blessid in to worldis.
Amen. £But not þat þe word of God £haþ fallen doun.
For not alle þat ben of Israel, £þes ben Israelitis. £Neþer þei þat ben seed of Abraham, £alle ben sones, £but in Isaac þe seed £shal be clepid to þee.
Þat is to seie, £not þei þat ben sones of þe fleiȝss, £ben sones of God, £but þei þat ben sones £of biheest £ben demed in þe seed.
For whi þis is þe word of biheest, £Aftir þis tyme shal I come, £and a sone shal be to Sare.
And not oonli she, £but also Rebecca hadde twei sones £of oon liȝgging £bi of Isaac, oure fadir.
And whanne þei weren not ȝit borne, £neþer hadden doo £any þing of good eþer of yuel, £þat þe purpos of God £shulde duelle bi eleccion, £not of werkis, £but of God clepinge, £it was seid to him, £Þat þe more shulde serue þe lasse, £as it is writen, £I louede Jacob, £but I hatide Esau.
What þerfore shulen we seie? £Wheþer wickidnesse be anentis God? £God forbede.
For he seiþ to Moises, £Y shal haue merci £on whom I shal haue mercy, £and I shal ȝife merci £on whom I shal haue merci.
Þerfore it is not neþer £of man willinge, £neþir rennyng, £but of God hauynge merci.
And þe scripture seiþ to Farao, £For to þis þing I haue stired þee, £þat I shewe in þee my vertu, £and þat my name be toold in al erþe.
Þerfore of whom God wole, £he haþ merci, £and whom he wole, £he endureþ. £Þanne seist þou to me, £What is souȝt ȝit? £For who wiþstondeþ his wille? £O man, £whoo art þou, £þat answerist to God? £Wher a maad þing seiþ to him £þat made it, £What hast þou maad me so? £Wheþer a potter of clei £haþ not power to make £of þe same gobett £oo vessel in to onour, £anoþer in to dispijt? £Þat if God willinge £to shewe his wraþþe, £and to make his power knowen, £haþ suffrid in gret pacience £vessels of wraþþe able in to deþ, £to shewe þe riȝcchessis £of his glorie £in to vessels of merci, £wiche he made redie in to glorie.
Wiche also he clepide not oneli of Jewis, £but also of heþene men, £25 as he seiþ in Osee, £I shal clepe not my puple my puple, £and not my louede my louede, £and not getinge merci geting merci; £and it shal be in þe place, £where it is seid to hem, £Not ȝe my puple, £þere þei shulen be clepid £þe sones of God lifinge. £But Isaie crieþ for Israel, £If þe noumbre of Israel £shal be as þe grauele of þe see, £þe relifes shulen be made safe.
Forsoþe a word makinge an ende, £and abreȝgginge in equyte, £for þe Lord shal £make a word breȝggid £on al erþe.
And as Isaie bifore seide, £But God of oostis hadde laft £to vs seed, £we hadden be maad as Sodom, £and we hadden be lijk as Gomor.
Þerfore what shulen we seie? £Þat heþene men £þat sueden not riȝtwesnesse, £han geten riȝtwesnesse, ȝhe, £þe riȝtwesnesse þat is of feiþ.
But Israel suynge £þe lawe of riȝtwesnesse, £cam not parfittli £in to þe lawe of riȝtwesnesse. £Whi? For not of feiþ, £but as of werkis.
And þei spurneden £aȝens þe stoon of offencion, £as it is writen, Lo! £I putte a stoon of offencion in Sion, £and a stoon of sclaundre; £and ech þat shal bileue in it, £shal not be confoundid.
CAP. X. £Breþern, þe wille of my herte £and my biseching £is maad to God £for hem in to helþe.
But I bere wittnessing to hem, £þat þei han loue of God, £but not aftir kunnyng.
For þei vnknowing Goddis riȝtwesnesse, £and sekinge to make stidefast her owne riȝtfulnesse, £ben not sogett to þe riȝtwesnesse of God.
For þe eende £of þe lawe is Crist, £to riȝtwesnesse to eche man þat bileueþ.
For Moises wroot, £For þe man þat shal do riȝtwesnesse £þat is of þe lawe, £shal life in it.
But þe riȝtwesnesse þat is of bileue, £seiþ þus, £Seie þou not in þi herte, £Who shal stie in to heuene? £(þat is to seie, £to leede doun Crist), £7 or who shal go doun in to helle? £(þat is, £to aȝenclepe Crist £fro deeþ).
But what seiþ þe scripture? £Þe word is niȝ in þi mouþ, £and in þi herte; £þis is þe word of bileue, £wiche we prechen.
Þat if þou knowlechist £in þi mouþ þe Lord Jhesu Crist, £and bileuest in þi herte, £þat God reiside him £fro deeþ, £þou shalt be saaf.
For bi herte me bileueþ to riȝtwesnesse, £but bi mouþ knowleching £is maad to heelþe.
For whi þe scripture seiþ, £Eche þat bileueþ to in him, £shal not be confoundid.
And þer is no distinccion of Jew and of Greke; £for þe same Lord £of alle is riche in alle, £þat inwardli clepen him.
For eche man £who euere shal inwardli £clepe þe name of þe Lord, £shal be saaf.
How þanne shulen þei inwardli clepe him, £in to whom þei han not bileued? £Or hou shulen þei bileue to him, £whom þei han not herd? £Hou shulen þei here, £wiþ oute a prechour? £And hou shulen þei preche, £but þei be sent? £As it is writen, £Hou feire ben þe feet £of hem þat prechen pees, £of hem þat prechen goode þingis.
But not alle men obeien to þe gospel.
For Isaie seiþ, £Lord, who bileuede £to oure heering? £Þerfore feiþ is of heering, £but heering bi þe word of Crist.
Here begynnyth a schort tretys £and a comfortabyl for synful wrecchys, £wherin thei may have gret solas and comfort £to hem and undyrstondyn the hy £and unspecabyl mercy £of ower sovereyn Savyowr Cryst Jhesu, £whos name be worschepd and magnyfyed £wythowten ende, £that now in ower days £to us unworthy deyneth £to exercysen hys nobeley £and hys goodnesse.
Alle the werkys of ower Saviowr £ben for ower exampyl and instruccyon, £and what grace that he werkyth £in any creatur £is ower profyth £yf lak of charyté £be not ower hynderawnce.
And therfor, £be the leve of ower mercyful Lord Cryst Jhesu, £to the magnyfying of hys holy name, £Jhesu, this lytyl tretys £schal tretyn sumdeel £in parcel of hys wonderful werkys, £how mercyfully, how benyngly, £and how charytefully he meved and stered £a synful caytyf unto hys love, £whech synful caytyf many yerys was in wyl £and in purpose thorw steryng £of the Holy Gost £to folwyn oure Savyour, £makyng gret behestys of fastyngys £wyth many other dedys of penawns.
And evyr sche was turned agen abak £in tym of temptacyon, £lech unto the reedspyr whech boweth £wyth every wynd £and nevyr is stable £les than no wynd bloweth, £unto the tyme £that ower mercyfulle Lord Cryst £Jhesu havyng pety and compassyon £of hys handwerke and hys creatur £turnyd helth into sekenesse, £prosperyté into adversyté, £worshep into repref, £and love into hatered.
Thus alle this thyngys turnyng up so down, £this creatur whych many yerys £had gon wyl £and evyr ben unstable £was parfythly drawen and steryd £to entren the wey of hy perfeccyon, £whech parfyth wey Cryst £ower Savyowr £in hys propyr persoone examplyd.
Sadly he trad it £and dewly he went it beforn.
Than this creatur, £of whom thys tretys £thorw the mercy £of Jhesu schal schewen in party the levyng, £towched be the hand of owyr Lord £wyth grett bodyly sekenesse, £wher thorw sche lost reson £and her wyttes a long tym £tyl ower Lord £be grace restoryd her ageyn, £as it schal mor £openly be schewed aftyrward.
Her werdly goodys, £whech wer plentyuows and abundawnt £at that day, £in lytyl whyle after £wer ful bareyn and bare.
Than was pompe and pryde cast down £and leyd on syde.
Thei that beforn had worshepd £her sythen ful scharply reprevyd her; £her kynred and thei that had ben frendys £wer now hyr most enmys.
Than sche, £consyderyng this wondyrful chawngyng, £sekyng socowr undyr £the wengys of hyr gostly modyr, £Holy Cherch, £went and obeyd hyr £to hyr gostly fadyr, £accusyng hyrself of her mysdeds, £and sythen ded gret bodyly penawns.
And in schort tyme ower mercyful Lord £vysytyd this creatur £wyth plentyuows teerys of contricyon day be day, £in so mech that sum men seyden sche mygth wepen £whan sche wold £and slawndered the werk of God.
Sche was so usyd £to be slawndred and repreved, £to be cheden £and rebuked of the world £for grace and vertu £wyth whech sche was indued £thorw the strength of the Holy Gost £that it was to her £in a maner of solas and comfort £whan sche sufferyd £any dysese for the lofe of God £and for the grace that God wrowht in hyr.
For evyr the mor slawnder £and repref that sche sufferyd, £the mor sche incresyd in grace £and in devocyon £of holy medytacyon £of hy contemplacyon £and of wonderful spechys £and dalyawns £whech owr Lord spak and dalyid £to hyr sowle, £techyng hyr how sche schuld be despysed £for hys lofe, £how sche schuld han pacyens, £settyng all hyr trost, £alle hyr lofe, £and alle hyr affeccyon £in hym only.
Sche knew and undyrstod £many secret and prevy thyngys £whech schuld beffallen £aftyrward be inspiracyon £of the Holy Gost.
And often tymes, £whel sche was kept £wyth swech holy spechys and dalyawns, £sche schuld so wepyn and sobbyn £that many men £wer gretly awondyr, £for thei wysten ful lytyl £how homly ower Lord was in hyr sowle.
Ne hyrself cowd nevyr £telle the grace £that sche felt, £it was so hevenly, £so hy aboven hyr reson £and hyr bodyly wyttys, £and hyr body so febyl £in tym of the presens of grace £that sche myth nevyr expressyn it £wyth her word lych £as sche felt it in hyr sowle. £Than had this creatur mech drede £for illusyons and deceytys £of hyr gostly enmys.
Than went sche be the byddyng of the Holy Gost £to many worshepful clerkys, £bothe archebysshopys and bysshoppys, £doctowrs of dyvynyté and bachelers also.
Sche spak also wyth many ankrys £and schewed hem hyr maner of levyng and swech grace £as the Holy Gost of hys goodnesse £wrowt in hyr mende £and in hyr sowle £as her wytt wold serven hyr £to expressyn it.
And thei alle that sche schewed hyr secretys £unto seyd sche was mech bownde £to loven ower Lord £for the grace £that he schewyd unto hyr £and cownseld hyr £to folwyn hyr mevynggys £and hyr steringgys £and trustly belevyn it £weren of the Holy Gost £and of noon evyl spyryt.
Summe of these worthy and worshepful clerkys £tokyn it in perel of her sowle £and as thei wold answer to God £that this creatur was inspyred £wyth the Holy Gost £and bodyn hyr £that sche schuld don hem wryten £and makyn a booke £of hyr felyngys and hir revelacyons.
Sum proferyd hir to wrytyn hyr felyngys £wyth her owen handys, £and sche wold not consentyn £in no wey, £for sche was comawndyd £in hir sowle £that sche schuld not wrytyn so soone.
And so it was twenty yer and mor £fro that tym this creatur £had fyrst felyngys and revelacyons £er than sche dede any wryten.
Aftyrward whan it plesyd ower Lord, £he comawnded hyr £and chargyd £hir that sche schuld don wryten £hyr felyngys and revelacyons £and the forme of her levyngs £that hys goodnesse myth be knowyn £to alle the world.
Than had the creatur no wryter £that wold fulfyllyn hyr desyr £ne geve credens £to hir felingys £unto the tym £that a man dwellyng in Dewchlond £whech was an Englyschman £in hys byrth £and sythen weddyd in Dewchland £and had ther bothe a wyf and a chyld, £havyng good knowlach £of this creatur £and of hir desyr, £meved I trost thorw the Holy Gost, £cam into Yngland £wyth hys wyfe £and hys goodys and dwellyd £wyth the forseyd creatur £tyl he had wretyn £as mech as sche wold tellyn hym £for the tym £that thei wer togydder. £And sythen he deyd.
Than was ther £a prest whech this creatur £had gret affeccyon to, £and so sche comownd £wyth hym of this mater £and browt hym the boke to redyn. £The booke was so evel wretyn £that he cowd lytyl skyll theron, £for it was neithyr good Englysch ne Dewch, £ne the lettyr was not schapyn ne formyd £as other letters ben.
Therfor the prest leved £fully ther schuld nevyr man redyn it, £but it wer special grace.
Nevyrthelesse, £he behyte hir £that if he cowd redyn it £he wolde copyn it owt £and wrytyn it betyr £wyth good wylle.
Than was ther £so evel spekyng of this creatur £and of hir wepyng £that the prest durst not for cowardyse speke £wyth her but seldom, £ne not wold wryten £as he had behestyd £unto the forseyd creatur.
And so he voyded and deferryd the wrytyng £of this boke £wel onto a fourth yer or ellys mor, £notwythstandyng the creatur cryed £often on hym therfor.
At the last he seyd onto hir £that he cowd not redyn it, £wherfor he wold not do it.
He wold not, £he seyd, £put hym in perel therof.
Than he cownseld hir £to gon to a good man £whech had ben mech conversawnt £wyth hym £that wrot fyrst the booke, £supposyng that he schuld £cun best rede the booke, £for he had sum tym red letters £of the other mannys £wrytyng sent fro beyonden the see £whyl he was in Dewchland.
And so sche went to that man, £preyng hym to wrytyn this booke £and nevyr to bewreyn it £as long as sche leved, £grawntyng hym a grett summe £of good for hys labowr.
And this good man £wrot abowt a leef, £and yet it was lytyl to the purpose, £for he cowd not wel fare therwyth £the boke was so evel sett £and so unresonably wretyn.
Than the prest was vexyd £in his consciens, £for he had behestyd hyr £to wrytyn this boke, £yyf he mygth com £to the redyng therof, £and dede not hys part £as wel as he mygth a do, £and preyd this creatur £to getyn ageyn the booke £yf sche myth goodly.
Than sche gat ageyn the book £and browt it £to the preste £wyth rygth glad cher, £preyng hym to do hys good wyl, £and sche schuld prey to God £for hym and purchasyn hym grace £to reden it £and wrytyn it also.
The preste, £trustyng in hire prayers, £began to redyn this booke, £and it was mych mor esy, £as hym thowt, £than it was beforntym.
And so he red it ovyr £beforn this creatur every word, £sche sumtym helpyng £where ony difficulté was.
Thys boke is not wretyn in ordyr, £every thyng aftyr other £as it wer don, £but lych as the mater cam £to the creatur in mend £whan it schuld be wretyn, £for it was so long £er it was wretyn £that sche had forgetyn the tyme £and the ordyr £whan thyngys befellyn.
And therfor sche dede no thing wryten £but that sche knew rygth wel £for very trewth.
Whan the prest began fyrst to wryten £on this booke, £hys eyn myssyd £so that he mygth not se to make hys lettyr £ne mygth not se to mend hys penne. £Alle other thyng he mygth se wel anow.
He sett a peyr of spectacles on hys nose, £and than wast wel wers £than it was befor. £He compleyned to the creatur £of hys dysese.
Sche seyd hys enmy had envye £at hys good dede £and wold lett hym £yf he mygth and bad hym do £as wel as God wold geve hym grace £and not levyn.
Whan he cam ageyn to hys booke, £he myth se as wel, £hym thowt, £as evyr he dede befor £be day lyth £and be candel lygth bothe.
And for this cause, £whan he had wretyn a qwayr, £he addyd a leef therto, £and than wrot he this proym £to expressyn mor openly £than doth the next folwyng, £whech was wretyn er than this.
Anno domini 1436.
Whan he was come £before hem they seide, £"Merlyn, £we knowe well thow art wise £and haste alwey loved wele £the kynges of this reame.
And thow knowest wele £that this londe £is lefte withouten heir, £and a londe withoute a lorde £availeth litill.
Therfore we pray thee and requere £to helpe us £to chese soche a man £as myght the reame governe £to the profite of the peple £and savacion of Holy Cherche."
And Merlin seide, £"I am no soche man £that owe to entermete £of soche counseile, £ne that I sholde chese a man £to be a governoure.
But yef ye acorde to myn awarde £I shall telle yow; £and yef I sey not wele, £acordeth not therto."
And thei seide, £"Alle to the welfare £and profite of us £alle oure Lorde sende grace!" £And Merlin seide, £"I have moche loved this reame £and the peple therinne, £and yef I wolde telle yow £whom ye sholde make youre kynge, £I ought wele to be beleved, £and it were right.
Bot oon faire aventure is yow befallen, £yef ye will it knowen.
The kynge is now deed sithe Martinmasse, £and fro hens to Yoole £is but litill space.
And yef ye leve my counseile, £I shall yeve yow gode and trewe, £bothe ageyn God and the worlde."
And thei seiden alle at ones, £"Sey what thow wilte, £and we shall it holden."
And he seide, £"Ye knowe wele £that now cometh the feste £that oure Lorde was inne ibore, £and He is Lorde £of alle lordes.
And I will undirtake, £yef ye and alle the peple £comynyally pray to oure Lorde £for His grete pité £for to sende yow a rightfull governour, £as He thourgh His grete humylité £at this feste cleped Yooleliste £to be born of a virgyn, £and Kynge of alle kynges, £that He at this feste chese yow soche a man £to be youre kynge and lorde, £that the peple may rule and governe £to His plesir; £and that He shew soche demonstraunce £that the peple may se and knowe £that it is be His eleccion, £and that he that so £is chosen be kynge £withoute eny other eleccion.
And wite ye well, £yef ye thus do, £ye shull se the eleccion £of oure Lorde Jhesu Criste."
Than they ansuerde alle £with oon assent and seide, £"We acorde with this counseile, £and ther is noon erthly man £but that he ought therto acorde."
Than thei praide £alle bisshopis and archebisshopes £to comaunde thourgh £all the cherches £that the peple to praye £as ye have herde.
And alle the lordes were sworne oon £to another to holde the awarde of Holy Cherche, £in that God wolde hem shewen.
In this maner be thei acorded £to the counseile of Merlin.
And Merlyn toke leve of hem, £and thei hym praide £to be with hem at Cristemasse, £to se yef it were soth or no £that he hadde hem taught.
And Merlyn seide, £"I shall not be ther, £for ye shull not se me £till the elecccion be made."
Thus wente Merlin to Blase £and tolde hym alle these thinges.
Than alle the worthy men £of the reame of Logres, £thei come unto Logres at the Yole.
Thus was this thinge don £and abiden to the Yole.
And Antor, that hadde this childe norisshed £till he was a moche man £of fifteen yere of age, £he hadde hym trewly norisshed £so that he was faire and moche; £and he hadde never soken other mylke £but of his wif, £and his sone he hadde made £to be norysshed of another woman.
Ne Antor wiste not £whether he loved better, £ne he cleped hym £never but his sone; £and he wende verily £that he hadde ben his fader.
At Halowmasse Antor made hys sone knyght, £and at Yoole he come to Logres, £as did the other knyghtes of the londe, £and brought with hym his two sones.
On Yoole Even was assembled £alle the clergie of the reame, £and alle the barouns £that weren of valoure £and wele hadde don £as Merlin hadde seide.
And whan they were alle come, £thei ledde alle symple lif and honeste.
Thus thei abode all the Yoole Even £and weren at messe at mydnyght, £and made mekely theire orisouns £to oure Lorde, £that He of His grace £sende hem soche a man £that myght profitably meyntene hem £and the Cristen feith.
Thus they abode the messe of the day, £and so ther were many £that seide thei were foles £that trowed oure Lorde £wolde put his entente £to chesinge of her kynge.
And as thei were in this talkynge, £thei rounge to messe of the day, £and so thei yede to servise.
Whan thei were alle assembled, £ther was oon of the holiest men £of the londe araied £to singe the messe.
But er he yede to messe, £he spake to the peple and seide, £"Ye be assembled £for thre thinges £for youre profite, £and I shall say yow £whiche thei be: £first of all, £for the savacion £of youre soules; £and for the wurship of God; £and the myracle and high vertu £that He thys day shall shewe amonge us, £yef it be His plesir £to yeve us a kynge and chiefteyn £that may save and mayntene Holy Cherche, £that is the sustenaunce £of alle trewe Cristen peple.
We be come to chese oon of us; £we be not so wise to knowe £who is moste profitable £of alle this peple.
And for that we ne knowe, £we owe to praye £to the Kynge of kynges £that is Jhesu Criste oure Saveoure, £that He shewe us verry tokenynge £to His pleasaunce, £as He was bore on this day.
So every man praye £in the beste wise he can."
And thus they did £as the gode man hem counseiled.
And he yede forth to masse, £and he com to the gospell £and that thei hadden offred.
Some of the peple yede £oute of the cherche £where ther was a voyde place.
And whan they com oute of the cherche, £thei sawgh it gan dawe and clere, £and saugh before the cherche dore £a grete ston foure square, £and ne knewe of what ston it was -- £but some seide it was marble.
And above, in the myddill place £of this ston, £ther stode a styth of iren £that was largely half a fote of height.
And thourgh this stithi £was a swerde ficchid into the ston.
When thei sye this £that firste weren come £oute of the chirche, £thei hadde gret merveile £and yede agein £into the chirche £and tolde the archebisshop.
And whan the gode man £that sange masse herde this, £he toke haly water £and caste upon the stith.
And the archebisshop lowted £to the swerde £and sawgh letteres of golde £in the stiel.
And he redde the letteres that seiden, £"Who taketh this swerde £out of this ston £sholde be kynge £by the eleccion of Jhesu Criste."
And when he hadde redde this letteres, £he seide to the peple £what it ment.
Than was the ston delivered £to ten worthi men to kepe, £and to two clerkes.
Than thei seiden £that oure Lorde £hadde hem shewed feire myracle, £and yeden agein £into the mynistre £to heir oute the masse £and to yelde oure Lorde graces.
And thei songen £"Te Deum Laudamus."
And whan the gode man £was come to the awter, £he turned to the peple and seide, £"Feire lordes, £now may ye se £that some of yow be goode men, £when thourgh youre prayers £and orisouns oure Lorde £hath shewde this grete myracle.
Wherfore I praye and reqire yow £above alle vertues £in this erthe, £for highnesse ne erthly richesse £that God hath yoven £in this worlde, £that noon be agein this eleccion £that God hath us shewde the demonstraunce.
And the surpluys £He shall us shewen £at His volunté."
Thanne the gode man £sange forth the masse.
And whan it was fynisshed £they assembled £aboute the ston, £bothe oon and other £who that myght take £oute this swerde firste.
And than thei seiden and acorded £alle that thei sholde assaien it £as the mynistres of Holy Cherche wolde assigne.
To this ther was grete discorde £amonge the higheste men £and moste puyssaunt.
And thei that hadde force seide £they wolden asseyen firste.
So ther were many wordes £that ought not to be rehersed.
The archebisshop spake £that alle myght heren and seide, £"Sirs, £ye ne be not so wise £ne so wele avised men £as I wende.
And I will wele £that ye alle wite £that oure Lorde hath oon ichosen, £but I knowe not whom.
And thus moche may I say to yow, £that gentilnesse ne richesse £shall have no power agein £the wille of Jhesu Criste, £but truste so moche in Hym £that yef he that is £therto chosen were yet unbore, £it shall never be taken £oute of the ston £till he come £that it is ordeyned the honour." £Than acorded alle the noble men and wise, £and seide that he hadde seide soth.
And the wise men £and the high barouns £toke their counseile £and acorded to stonde £the ordenaunce of the archebisshop, £and [thei] com agein £and seiden heringe £alle the peple.
And than made the bisshop grete joye £and dide wepe £for pité and seide, £"This humylité that is £in youre hertes £is of God.
And I will that ye knoweafter myn entente £shall be to the volunté of God £and profite of Cristen feith, £so that I shall have no blame £yef God will." £This parlament was before high messe £of the assay of the swerde, £till that high messe was saide.
Than seide the archebisshop £to the peple £and shewde hem the gret myracle £that God hadde don for hem £at this eleccion: £"And whan oure Lorde sette justice in erthe, £He sette it in the styth £and in the swerde.
And the justice over the lay peple £ought to be the swerde, £for the swerde £at the begynynge was take £to thre orderes £to diffende Holy Cherche £and mayntene rightwisnesse.
And oure Lorde hath now made eleccion £be the swerde.
And wite it wele, £alle that this have seen and beholde, £to whom He will the justice yeve.
And lete no man be to hasty £for to assaye, £for it shall never be drawen oute £for richesse ne for pride.
Ne the poure peple be not displesed £though the lordes £and the high astates assaye before, £for it is right and reson £that the lordes assaien firste.
For ther ne is noon of yow £but he ought to have his kynge £and his lorde the beste and moste worthy man £that he kowthe knowe be his reson."
Thus thei acorded to the archebisshop £with gode herte £and withouten evyll will, £that he sholde chese hem £that he wolde to assaye firste.
Thus thei graunted alle £to holde hym £for hir kynge £to whom God wolde shewe his grace.
Thanne the archebisshop chese £oute one hundred fifty £of the hiest and moste worthi lordes £and made hem go to the assaie.
And whan they hadde alle assayed, £than he commaunded alle other to assaye.
And than they assayden alle they, £oon after another, that assaye wolde. £But ther was noon £that myght it taken oute.
And so it was comaunded £to be kept with ten noble men, £and thei were charged £to take goode hede £who com to assaien, £and yef eny ther were £that myght drawen out of the ston. £Thus was the swerde assaied £alle the eight dayes, £and alle the barouns were at high messe.
And the archebisshop hem preched and shewde £as hym semed beste.
And than he seide, £"I tolde yow wele £that all be leysere myght he come £that was ferthest £fro the assaye of this swerde.
Now may ye verily knowe £that never noon, £saf he that oure Lorde will, £ne shall it not oute take."
And than thei seiden £alle that thei wolde not out of the town £till thei westen £to whom God wolde graunte that honoure.
In that maner thei abiden oute the messe, £and after thei wente £to their hosteles to mete.
And after mete, £as they were used that tyme, £yede the barouns and the knyghtes £to boorde in a feire pleyn, £and the ten men that were ordeyned £to kepe this swerde £yede also to se this bourdise.
And when the knyghtes hadde turneyd awhile, £thei toke their sheldes £to their squeres £so that the peple of the town yede £to arme them. £And Antor hadde made his eldeste sone knyght £at the Halowtide £before Yoole.
And whan the medlé was begunne, £Kay called his brother Arthur and seide, £"Go faste to oure oste £and fecche my swerde."
And Arthur was goode and servisable and seide, £"With gode will."
And than [he] smote the hors £with the spores £and rode forth £to his ostell £for to fecche his brothers swerde, £or ellis some other, £yef he myght eny fynde.
And he fonde noon, £for the hostesse hadde sette it £in hir chambir.
And so he turned to hem agein.
And whan he saugh he myght noon fynde, £he gan to wepe for grete anger.
And as he come before the mynster £ther the ston was, £he saugh the swerde £whiche he hadde never assaide, £and thought, £yef he myght it gete, £to bere it to his brother.
And as he com therby on horse bakke, £he hente the swerde £be the hiltes £and drough it oute, £and covered it with his lappe.
And his brother that abode after £withoute the towne saugh hym come, £and rode agein hym £and asked his swerde.
And Arthur seide he myght not have it, £"but I have brought heere another," £and drough it £oute from undyr his cote £and toke it £to his brother.
And anoon as Kay saugh this swerde, £he knewe it wele £that it was the swerde £of the ston £and thought he wolde be kynge, £and seide he wolde seche his fader £till he fonde hym; £and than he seide, £"Sire, I shall be kynge.
Lo, here is the swerde of the ston."
Whan the fader it saugh, £he hadde merveile £how he it gatt. £And he seide he toke it £oute of the ston. £Whan Antor herde £that he leved it not £but seide he dide lye. £Than thei yede £to the mynster £ther the ston was, £and the tother squyre after.
Whan Antor sigh the ston £and the swerde £not therynne he seide, £"Feire sone, £how hadde ye this swerde? £Loke ye do not lye; £and thow do lye, £I shall it knowewele £and never shall I thee love."
And he ansuerde as he £that was sore ashamed, £"I shall yow lye no lesynge, £for my brother Arthur it me brought £whan I badde hym £to go fecche myn. £But I wote never how he it hadde." £Whan Antor herde this he seide, £"Sone, £yeve it me, £for ye have therto no ryght." £And Kay it delivered £to his fader. £And he loked behynde hym £and saugh Arthur £and cleped hym and seide, £"Come hider, £faire sone, £and take this swerde £and put it theras £ye it toke."
And he toke the swerde £and put it in the stith, £and it heilde as wele or better £than it dide before.
And Antor comaunded his sone Kay £to take it oute.
And he assaied, £but it wolde not be.
Than Antor cleped hem bothe £and seide to Kay, £"I wiste well £that thow haddest not take the swerde oute."
Thanne he toke Arthur £in his armes and seide, £"Feire dere sone, £yef I myght purchase £that ye be kynge, £what gode sholde I have therfore?" £"Fader," £quod he, £"I may nother have that honour £ne noon other goode £but that ye be therof lorde, £as my lorde and my fader."
And he seide, £"Sir, £youre fader I am as in norture, £but certes, £I dide yow never engender, £ne I wot never £who dide yow engender."
Whan Arthur saugh £that Antor hym denyed £to ben hys fader, £he wepte tendirly £and hadde grete doel and seide, £"Feire sir, £how sholde I have this dignité £or eny other £whan I have failed to have a fader?" £"A fader muste ye nede have.
But feire dere sir, £yef oure Lorde will £that ye have this grace £and I helpe yow it to purchase, £telle me what I shall be the better."
And Arthur seide, £"Sir, £so as ye will youreself."
Thanne Antor tolde hym £what bounté he hadde hym don, £and how he hadde hym norisshed, £and how he put awey his sone Kay £and made hym £to be norisshed £of a straunge woman.
"Wherefore ye owe £to yeve my sone £and me guerdon, £for ther was never man £more tenderly norisshed £than I have yow.
Wherefore I praye yow, £yef God yeve yow this grace £and I may helpe yow therto, £that ye guerdon me and my sone."
And Arthur seide, £"I pray yow £that ye denye not me £to be my fader, £for than I sholde not wite £whether that I sholde go.
And yef ye may £helpeto purchase this grace, £and God will that I have it, £ye can nothinge sey ne comaunde £but I shall it do."
And Antor seide, £"I shall not aske thi londe; £but thus moche I will praye yow, £that yef ye be kynge, £that ye make my sone £Kay youre stywarde in soche maner £that for no forfet £that he do to yow, £ne to man of youre londe, £that he lese not hys office.
And yef he be fool or fell or vilenis, £ye owe better to suffre hym £than eny other.
And therfore I praye yow £to graunte hym £that I yow demaunde."
And Arthur seide £he wolde it do £with gode will.
And than he ledde hym £to the auter £and swore that he sholde this trewly performe.
And whan he hadde sworne, £he com before the mynster; £and the turnement was ended, £and the barouns com to hire evesonge.
Than Antor cleped £alle his frendes £and com to the archebisshop and seide, £"Sir, lo, £here is a childe of myn £that is no knyght, £that prayeth me £that I wolde helpe £that he myght assay the aventure £of the swerde, £and that it plese yow £to clepe the barouns."
And so he did, £and thei assembled £aboute the ston.
Than Antor bad Arthur take £oute the swerde £and delyvere it to the archebisshop.
And Arthur toke the swerde £be the hiltes £and withoute more taryinge yaf it £to the archebisshop.
And anoon he toke Arthur £in his armes and seide, £"Te Deum Laudamus," £and so brought hym £into the mynster.
And the barouns and high men £that this hadde seyn and herde £were angry and sorowfull for this, £and seiden it myght not be £that soche a symple man £of so lowe degré £sholde be lorde of hem alle.
Therwith was the archebisshop displesed £and seide, £"Sirs, £oure Lorde knoweth £beste what every man is."
And Antor and his frendes abode by Arthur, £and alle the comen peple.
And alle the barouns £were ageyn them and ageyn Arthur.
And thanne seide the archebisshop £wordes of grete hardynesse: £"I do yow to wite thaugh £alle thei that ben in the £worlde wolde be agein this eleccion, £and oure Lorde will £that this man be kynge, £he shall be it £withouten faile.
And I shall shewe yow £how and what affiaunce I have £in oure Lorde Jhesu Criste.
Now, feire brother Arthur, £go put the swerde ageyn £in the same place £that ye toke itfro."
And Arthur put the swerde ageyn £in the selve place, £and it hilde £as faste as byfore.
And than seide the archebisshop, £"So feire eleccion was never sene.
Now go ye riche barouns and lordes £and assay yef ye may take £oute the swerde."
Than yede alle for to assaye, £but noon it myght remeve £fro the place that it was inne.
Than seide the archebisshop, £"Grete folye do ye £that be ageyn oure Lordes wille -- £for now ye se well how it is."
And thei seide, £"Sir, £we ne be not agein oure Lordes wille, £but it ys grevouse thinge to us £to have a garcion £to be lorde over us alle."
And the archebisshop seide, £"He that hath hym chosyn knoweth beste £what he is."
Thanne the barouns praide the bisshop £to lete the swerde be stille £in the ston tille Candelmesse; £and by that tyme, £men of ferther contrees myght come £to assaye the aventure.
And the archebisshop hem graunted.
Than come oute £of every contree and asseyde, £who that wolde.
And whan they hadden assaied, £the archebisshop seide, £"Arthur, £yef it be pleser £to oure Lorde Jhesu Criste £that thow be kynge, £go forth and brynge that swerde."
And Arthur yede to the swerde £and toke it oute £as lyghtly as nothinge hadde it holden.
Whan the prelates £and the comen peple saugh this, £thei gunne to wepe £for joye and pité and seiden, £"Sirs, £is ther yet eny man £that seith agein this eleccion?" £And the barouns seide, £"Syr, £we pray yow £that the swerde be suffred £yet in the ston to Passh, £but eny man come £by that terme £that may take it thens; £and ellis we will obbey to this.
And yef ye will not suffre £so longe tyme, £every man do the beste he may."
And the archebisshop seide, £"Yef so be he abide to Passh, £and noon other come £that may parforme this aventure, £wele ye than obbey yow to this eleccion?" £And thei seide alle, £"Ye."
Thanne the archebisshop seide to Arthur, £"Sette the swerde agein £in the ston, £for yef God will, £thow shalt not faile £of the dignité £that he hath thee promysed." £And Arthur did £as he comaunded.
And ther was ordeyned £to kepe the ston ten men and five clerkes; £and in this maner £thei bode to Pasch.
And the archebisshop that hadde take Arthur £in warde seide, £"Wite ye right well £ye shall be kynge £and lorde of this peple.
Now loke that ye be a gode man, £and fro hensforth cheseth soche men £as shull be of youre counseile £and officers £for youre housolde, £even as ye were now kynge, £for so ye shall be £with the helpe of God."
And Arthur seide, £"I put me holly in God £and in Holy Cherche £and in youre gode counseile.
Therfore chese ye £as ye seme be moste £to the plesaunce of Jhesu Criste.
And I praye yow clepe £to yow my lorde my fader."
Than the archebisshop cleped Antor £and shewde hym £the ansuere of Arthur.
Thanne chose they soche counsellers £as thei wolde; £and be counseile of the archebisshop £and certein of the barouns, £Kay was made stiwarde.
And of alle othir thinges £thei abode to Pasch, £and than thei assembled at Logres.
Whan thei were alle assembled £on the Ester Even, £the archebisshop drough hem £alle to his paleis £and rehersed £hem the grete wisdom £and the gode condiciouns £that he fonde in Arthur.
And the barouns seide, £"We will not be agein Godes ordenaunce; £but it is unto us a mervelouse thynge £that so yonge a man, £and of so base lyngnage, £sholde be lorde and governour £of us alle."
The archebisshop seide, £"Ye do not as Cristen men £thus to be agein Cristes eleccion."
And they seide, £"We be not ther agein; £but ye have seyn his condiciouns, £and we ne have not don so.
And therfore we praye yow £to suffre us £to knowe his condiciouns £and the manere of hys governaunce £that he will ben of hereafter."
The archebisshop seide, £"Will ye thus delaye his coronacioun?" £And they seide, £"We wolde that his sacringe and coronacion £be respite to Penticoste. £Thus we alle pray and requere." £And the archebisshop it graunted. £Thus departed alle the counseile.
And on the morowe £whan high messe was seide, £Arthur yede to the swerde £and toke it oute £as lightly as he hadde don before.
Than thei seiden £alle that thei wolde have hym £to their lorde and governoure, £and thei praide hym £to sette ther the swerde agein.
And Arthur ansuerde £to the barouns full debonerly £and seide he wolde do their requeste, £or eny thinge £that thei wolde of hym desire.
Thanne they ledde hym £into the mynster to speke with hym £and to assaye his condiciouns and seide, £"Sir, £we se well that God will £that ye be oure kynge £and lorde over us, £wherfore we will do £to yow oure homage £and of yow holde oure honoures.
And we beseke yow £to respite youre sacringe £into Pentecoste, £ne therfore shull ye £nothynge be inteript £but that ye shull be oure lorde £and oure kynge.
But to this we praye yow £to seye us what is your volunté."
Quod Arthur, £"Of that ye sey ye will do £to me youre homages £and holde youre honoures of me, £I may it not receyve, £ne I ne ought not to do so, £for I may not to yow £ne to noon £other yeve noon honoures £till I have receyved myn.
And ther ye sey ye will £that I be lorde of yow £and of the reame, £that may not be byfore £that I be sacred and receyved £the honoure of the empere.
But the respite that ye desire £I it graunte yow £with gode will, £for I will not be sacred, £ne nothinge that therto aperteneth, £ne I may not withouten Godes will £and youre volunté."
Thanne seide the barouns amonge hemselfe, £"Yef this childe live, £he shall be right wise; £and wele he hath us ansuerde."
And than thei seide, £"Sir, £us semeth with youre advice £that ye be crowned and sacred £at Pentecoste, £and by that terme £we shull obbey to yow £at the comaundement £of this archebisshop."
Thanne thei made be brought juellis £and alle othir richesse and yaf it to hym £to se whedir £he wolde be covetouse and cacchynge.
And whan he hadde £alle these yeftes resceyved, £the booke seith he departed it: £to knyghtes, £the stedes and coursers and fresshe robes; £and to hem that were joly and envoisies, £he yaf the juwellis; £and to hem that were averouse, £golde and silver; £and to sadde wise men, £he yaf soche thinge £as hym thought sholde hem plese.
And with hem he heilde companye £and enquered in the contré £what myght hem beste plese.
Thus departed he the yeftes £that were yoven hym, £for to knowe of what condicion £that he wolde be of.
And whan thei sawgh hym £thus demened, £ther was noon £but that hym gretly preysed £in theire hertes, £and seide that he sholde £be of high renon, £and that thei cowde not in hym £espie no poynte of covetise.
But as sone as he hadde the grete avers, £he besette hem in soche manere £that every man seide £that noon cowde have do better, £everych astate and degré.
Thus thei assaide Arthur £and nought cowde fynde in hym £but high vertu and grete discrecion.
And so thei abiden to the Witsontide, £and than alle the baronage assembled at Logres.
And ther thei assaide agein £at the swerde £alle that assaie wolde, £but never was ther founde man £that it myght remeve fro the ston.
And the archebisshop hadde ordeyned £redy the crowne and septre £and all that longed £to the sacringe.
On Witson Even, £be comen counseile £of alle the barouns, £the archebisshop made Arthur knyght.
