LIFE OF ALEXANDER 
How Anectanabus fled Egypt to Macedonia 
The most learned Egyptians 
who know the size of the earth, 
the waves of the sea, 
and the order of the heavens 
(betokening the way of the stars 
and the turning of the skies), 
have bequeathed these things 
to the whole world 
through the highness 
and the wisdom of magic knowledge.

And they tell of a king of that land, 
by name Anectanabus, 
great in understanding, 
and full of love 
in astrology and mathematics.

Now, upon a day it happened 
that a messenger came, 
and said unto him 
that Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, 
was drawing nigh towards him 
with a very great force of foes.

Yet he did not call out his army, 
nor get ready his advance.

Instead of this, 
he hurried into his bedchambers in his palace, 
and, taking down a brazen shell, 
which was full of rainwater, 
and holding in his hand a brazen rod, 
sought by magic spells 
to summon the devils.

By which wizardry he felt, 
in the shell itself, 
the fleets sailing over him 
amid fearful affray.

Now there were lords of 
Anectanabus set in sway over his armies 
to guard the Persian border.

And one hapless man coming to him, 
besought him: 
'O most mighty King Anectanabus, 
there ariseth against thee Artaxerxes, 
the king of the Persians, 
with an untold horde of foes and strange races.

For they are Parthians, Medes, Persians, Syrians, Mesopotamians, Brapes, Phares, Argiri, Chaldaeans, Bachiri, Confires, Hircanians, and Agiophii, 
and many other folks coming from Eastern lands.' 
On hearing this, 
Anectanabus said, sighing: 
'The trust that I gave to thee, 
heed thou right well; 
yet thy prowess 
hath not been the prowess 
of a doughty man, 
but the doings of a cowardly fellow.

For worth showeth itself, 
not in the greatness of the folk, 
but in the steadfastness of their souls.

Dost thou not know 
one lion putteth many does to flight?' 
And having said these words, 
he went into his chamber alone, 
and made brazen shells, 
and filled them with rainwater, 
and held in his hand a palm rod, 
and gazing into this, began, 
as hard as he could, 
to utter spells, 
and beheld how the Egyptians were being smitten down 
at the onslaught of the Barbarians' ships.

Forthwith he changed his dress, 
and shaved his head and beard, 
and took gold 
as much as he might bear, 
and which might be needful to him 
to busy himself with wizardry.

And thus he fled from Egypt, 
near by Pelusium.

And at length, 
coming into Ethiopia, 
he put on linen apparel, 
in the guise of an Egyptian seer 
went into Macedonia.

And there he sate himself, 
and before all the Greeks, 
and in their sight was soothsaying.

But the Egyptians, 
when they saw how Anectanabus was not at Court, 
went to Serapis, 
who was their greatest god, 
and besought him 
that he might give them answer 
as to Anectanabus their king.

And Serapis replied: 
'Anectanabus, your king, 
is gone from Egypt 
because of Artaxerxes, 
the king of the Persians, 
who will subdue you 
unto his lordship.

Nevertheless, when a short time hath flown by, 
he will come back 
to shake off his thraldom, 
and will be avenged on your foes, 
and yoke them under you.' 
And as soon as they had got this answer, 
they made a kingly statue 
out of a black stone, 
in honour of Anectanabus.

And they wrote on it, 
at his feet, 
this saying, 
that it might be handed down 
for their offspring 
to think of.

But Anectanabus remained in Macedonia, 
nor was he known.
How Anectanabus went up to the Palace 
to Olympia the Queen.

In the meantime, 
Philip, king of Macedonia, 
went out to battle.

But Anectanabus went forward to the palace, 
that he might behold Olympia the queen, 
and see how fair she was.

And when he saw her, 
his heart was smitten with love of her, 
and stretching forth his hand, 
he greeted her, saying, 
'Hail, Queen of Macedonia,' 
disdaining to call her 'lady'.

And she, Olympia, 
answered him, 
speaking thus: 
'Hail, master, 
come thou 
and sit near.' 
And when he sate thus, 
Olympia asked many things of him.

'Art thou not an Egyptian?' 
And Anectanabus answered: 
'The word thou saidst was kingly, 
when thou didst name the Egyptians.

For the Egyptians are wise, 
and read dreams, 
understand the birds of the air in their flight, 
open up the hidden places, 
and tell the fate of those newborn, babes.

Of all these things, 
as a seer, 
I, too, have knowledge.' 
And Olympia saw how he gazed upon her, 
and spoke, 
'Master, 
of what dost thou bethink thee, 
who thus lookest on me?' 
And Anectanabus answered, 
'I call to my mind 
many answers of the gods.

One answer had been 
that I was to look upon a queen.' 
And saying this, 
he drew forth from his breast 
a cleansing tablet of bronze and ivory, 
inwrought with gold and silver, 
and on its face were three whirls.

The first contained in itself the Twelve Minds, 
and in the third, 
sun and moon were fashioned.

Next to them, 
was seen a chain of ivory, 
and from it he pulled forth 
sever wonderbright stars, 
that told the hours 
and birthdooms of men, 
and seven carven stones, 
and two stones 
for the saving men whole.

And Olympia beheld these things, 
and said: 
'Master, if thou wouldst I should believe thee, 
tell me the year, 
the day and hour of the king's birth.' 
And upon this, 
he said to the queen, 
'Wishest thou to hear nothing else from me?' 
Quoth the queen, 
'Tell me what shall fall out 
betwixt Philip and me, 
for men say that, 
when Philip shall come from the war, 
he will thrust me forth, 
and take another mate.' 
And Anectanabus answered: 
'They prate of many things untruly; 
but ere a long time pass, 
it shall be as they say.' 
And the queen answered: 
'I beg thee, 
master, 
unveil me all the truth.' 
Thereupon Anectanabus:
'One of the mightiest gods 
shall share thy bed 
and uphold thee 
through all thy thrivings and downfalls, 
even if they be overstrong.' 
Olympia replied: 
'I beseech thee, 
say what shape this god shall put on?' 
Anectanabus replied: 
'Neither young, nor old; 
his beard besprinkled with white hairs.
Wherefore, if this please thee, 
be ready for him, 
for at night shalt thou see him, 
and in thy sleep 
shall he lie by thee.' 
The queen said: 
'If I behold this, 
neither as a seer, 
nor as godly, 
but, as the god himself, 
will I worship' .

And at once Anectanabus said, 
'Fare thee well, 
O queen.' 
After this Anectanabus, 
leaving the palace, 
and walking straight forth 
to the city's camp 
in a desert spot, 
tore up herbs, 
and ground them, 
and took their juice, 
and wrought spells 
and other like things of the fiend, 
that in that same night 
Olympia might behold the god Hamon 
lying beside her, 
and saying to her thereafter, 
'Woman, thou hast conceived him 
who shall beshield thee.' 
And, on the morrow, 
Olympia awoke 
from her slumbers, 
and called Anectanabus to her, 
and told him 
of the dream she had beheld.

Then Anectanabus said: 
'If thou wilt give me room in the palace, 
thou shalt see the god himself, 
face to face.

For that god shall come to thee 
in the shape of a great snake, 
and soon after, 
taking on a manlike body, 
he shall seem to be in my likeness.' 
And to this Olympia said: 
'As thou hast spoken, 
master, do.

Take to thyself a bed in the palace, 
and canst thou make good the truth thereof, 
I will deem thee 
to be the father of the boy.' 
And, about the first watch of the night, 
Anectanabus took on him, 
through spells and wizardry 
to be changed 
into the shape of a great snake, 
and whistling on to the bedchamber of Olympia, 
to fly through.

And he entered her room, 
and rose on to her bed, 
and with great love began to kiss her, 
and the kisses betokened to her 
who he was.

And when he rose up from the bed, 
he smote her on the womb, 
and spake: 
'This begetting be thy avenging, 
and in no wise 
may it be upbraided of men.' 
On such a fashion was Olympia cheated, 
who had lain with a man 
as though he had been a god.

And in the morning, 
Anectanabus went down from the palace, 
and the queen was with child.

And when she began to be big, 
she called unto her Anectanabus, 
saying: 
'Master, 
tell me, 
what doom will Philip wreak on me, 
when he shall come back?' 
And Anectanabus said to her, 
'Be not afraid: 
god Hamon will champion thee.' 
And with these words 
he left the palace, 
and went outside the town, 
to a barren spot.

And, uprooting grasses, rubbed them, 
and grated them, 
and took their sap.

And he caught a seabird, 
and began to sing 
over the herbs, 
and anoint the herbs with the sap.

This he did in fellowship 
with the fiends, 
that he might betray King Philip 
through a dream.

And this was brought about.

That same night the god Hamon appeared to Philip, 
in a dream, 
lying with his wife Olympia, 
and, the night ended, he saw him touch her womb, 
and seal it with a golden ring.

And on the ring there was a stone, 
and graven on this a lion's head, 
and the chariot of the sun, 
and a very sharp sword.

And he said to her: 
'Woman, thou hast conceived thy saviour.' 
And Philip awoke from his sleep, 
and calling Arideus, 
made known to him the dream, 
and what he had seen.

And Arideus said: 
'Philip, 
not from man, 
but from a god, 
hath thy wife conceived.

In truth, the lion's head 
and the chariot of the sun 
and the sharp sword, 
foretoken that he, 
who shall be born of her, 
shall journey to the East 
whence riseth the sun! 
And with the sharp sword 
shall he underyoke 
to himself the nations of the whole world.' 
How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Mighty Dragon 
went to the fore 
in front of Philip 
and overcame his Enemies in the Fray.

In the meanwhile, 
King Philip fought and won.

For there appeared in the battle a dragon, 
who went before him 
and laid low his foes.
And when he came back to Macedonia, 
he met and kissed Olympia.

And King Philip gazed upon her, 
and said, 
'To whom, 
O Olympia, 
hast thou given thyself up.
For sinned thou hast, 
yet not sinned, 
for as much as thou hast brooked frowardness 
from a god.

But I have seen all that has been done 
by a god on thee, 
in a dream: 
therefore be blameless in my eyes, 
and the eyes of all men!' 
How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Dragon 
came before Philip at a Festival 
and kissed Olympia.

On a certain day Philip was feasting 
with his lords and chieftains of Macedonia 
and with Olympia his wife.

And Anectanabus through wizardry 
took on himself the shape of a dragon, 
and, passing through the midst of the couch 
whereon they lay apart, 
whistled so loudly 
that all the revellers were stricken with fear, 
and the greatest dread, 
and coming near Olympia, 
he put his head on her breast 
and kissed her.

Philip, seeing this, 
spoke to Olympia, 
'Woman, 
thee and all I tell; 
beheld this dragon, 
what time I laid my enemies low.' 
How a Bird laid an Egg 
in Philip's Bosom at whose breaking there came forth a Serpent, 
which forthwith died.

And a few days after this Philip the king was sitting 
in his palace, 
and there appeared unto him 
a little and most gentle bird, 
which flew into his bosom 
and laid an egg.
And the egg, falling to the ground, was broken.

And at once there crept 
forth from it a very little snake.

And it turned around, 
wishful to go into the egg, 
but, before it might put in its head, 
it was quenched.

And Philip, seeing this, 
was heavily distressed, 
and called to him Arideus, 
and showed him 
the monstrous thing he had seen.

And Arideus said to him, 
'King Philip, 
a son shall be born to thee, 
who shall reign after thy death, 
and shall fare forth 
over the whole world 
and sway all peoples, 
and ere he come back 
to the land of his birth, 
shall die by a most swift death.' 
And as the time of childbirth 
was drawing nigh, 
Olympia began to feel pain, 
and her womb was tormented, 
and she bade Arideus 
be called to her, 
and spoke with him: 
'Master, 
my womb is wrenched 
with very heavy labours.' 
Anectanabus then spake: 
'Raise thyself awhile 
from thy throne, 
for in this hour the elements are troubled 
by the sun.' 
This was done, 
and the pain went from her.
And soon after, 
Anectanabus said to her, 
'Sit down, 
O Queen!' 
and she sate herself 
and bore a child.

And as soon as the boy was fallen 
on to the earth, 
a mighty thunderclap and thunderbolts, 
with tokens and lightnings 
came about throughout the whole world.
Then night was spread forth and lasted, 
it reaching unto the last hour of day.

Then parts of the clouds fell down in Italy.
And seeing these signs, 
Philip the king was afrighted, 
and went in to Olympia, 
and said: 
'I deemed that this little babe 
should in no wise be fostered.

For he is not conceived of me, 
but of some god, 
for at his birth I beheld the heavens changed.

Yet let him be fostered in my memory, 
as though he were my son, 
and follow in the stead of a son 
I begot through another wife.' 
And when he said this, 
she handled the babe with great care.

And the boy's face had the likeness 
neither of father nor mother.

The hair on his head was shaggy 
as a lion's.

His eyes glistened like the stars, 
but each beamed 
with its own hue, 
one black, the other yellow.

And his teeth were sharp, 
and his eager rush 
as a lion's.

His shape foreshadowed his energy and forethought.
By his parents he was called Alexander.

In the schools, 
and wheresoever he sate, 
he strove with them 
in letters and disputations, 
and by his keen swiftness won the mastership.

And when he was twelve years old, 
he was beweaponed for battle, 
and excelled in arms.
And Philip, 
seeing how quick he was, 
praised him, 
and said: 
'Son Alexander, 
I love thy speed, 
and wit of mind for its work.

But I am sore and feel foolish 
that thy form is no unlike mine.' 
And Olympia heard this, 
and was greatly afraid.

And she called hither Anectanabus, 
and said: 
'Master, learn from me 
what Philip misdeemeth.

For he said to Alexander, 
"Son, 
I love thy speed 
and wit of mind.

But, that thy shape is unlike mine, 
I am saddened."' 
And Anectanabus began to think, 
and said: 
'His thought is nowise harmful.' 
And gazing aloft 
as he was wont, 
he looked on a certain star, 
and riddled out his wish.

And when Alexander heard this, 
he spake: 
'The star thou seest is seen in the heavens?' 
And Anectanabus replied: 
'My son, it is.' 
Alexander said: 
'Canst thou show it unto me?' 
Anectanabus answered: 
'Follow me in the hour of night, 
and I will show it unto thee.' 
Alexander said: 
'Thy fate is not known to thee, 
or uncertain?' 
Anectanabus replied: 
'Enough of this.' 
Alexander said: 
'I would fain know it.' 
Anectanabus answered: 
'In truth know that 
from my son shall come my death.' 
This said, 
as he went down from the palace, 
Alexander followed him 
in the hour of the evening without the city.

And when they arrived 
up on to the ditch of the city, 
Anectanabus spake: 
'Son Alexander, 
gaze thou on the stars; 
look how the star of Hercules is perplexed, 
and how Mercury's star is blithe.

If I see Jove sparkling, my doom telleth me 
of my coming death 
at the hands of my son.' 
At this sight Alexander came up nigh to him, 
and made an onslaught on him, 
making him fall down̛ 
in to þe dyke, 
and thare he feƚƚe, 
& was aƚƚ tofrusched̛; 
and þan̛ Alexander said̛ 
vnto hym one this wyse.

'Fals wreche,' 
quoþ he, 
'that presumeȝ to teƚƚ thyngeȝ 
þat ere to com̛, 
reȝte als þou were a prophete, 
and knewe þe preuateȝ of heuen̛.

Now may þou see that þou lyeȝ, 
And þarefore þou arte worthy 
to hafe swilke a dede.' 
And than̛ Anectanabus ansuerd̛, & said̛: 
'I wyste wele ynoghe,' 
quoþ he, 
'þat I scholde die swylke a dede.

Talde I noȝte lange are to þe, 
that myn̛ awenn̛ son̛ schulde slae me ?' 
'Whi, ame I thi son̛ ?' 
þan̛ quoþ Alexandire: 'ȝaa, for sothe,' 
quoþ Anectanabus, ' 
I gat the.' 
And wit þat word̛, he ȝalde þe gaste.

And than̛ Alexander hert tendird̛ on̛ his Fader, 
And he tuke hym 
vp on his bakke, 
and bare hym to þe palace.

And when̛ his moder Olympias saw hym, 
Scho said̛ vntiƚƚ hym.

'Son̛,' 
quoþ scho, 
'what es that?' 
'Als thi foly hase made it,' 
quoþ he, 
'so it es.' 
And than̛ he gert berye hym wirchipfully.

In the mene tyme, 
a prynce of Macedoyne 
broghte þe kyng a horse vntemed̛, 
a grete and a faire; 
& he was tyed̛ on̛ ilke side 
wit chynes of Iren̛, 
for he walde wery men̛ and ete þam̛.

This ilke horse was called̛ Buktiphalas, 
bicause of his vgly lukynge, 
For he hade a heued̛ lyke a buƚƚe, 
& knottiƚƚs in his frount, 
as þay had hene þe bygynnyng of hournes.

And when̛ þe kyng saw þe bewtee of this horse, 
he said tiƚƚ his seruandis, 
'Takeȝ this horse and putteȝ hym in a stable, 
and makes barreȝ of yren̛ before hym, 
that thefeȝ and oþer mysdoers, 
þat saƚƚ be done to dede, 
may be putt intiƚƚ hym, 
to be slaen̛ of hym.
And þay didd̛ soo.

In þe mene tyme þe kynge Philippe had̛ 
ane answere of his goddes, 
that hee schulde regne 
nexte after hym, 
the whilke myghte ryde 
that wylde horse witowtten̛ harme.

So it feƚƚe þat Alexander þe whilke was 
þan̛ twelue ȝere alde, 
wexe strange & reȝte hardy, 
& was wysse and discrete; 
for he was wele 
lered̛ & connand̛ 
in aƚƚ þe seuen̛ sciences, 
þe whilke twa philosophirs had teched̛ hym : 
þat es to say, 
Arestotle & Calistene.

And one a day, 
as Alexander passed̛ forby þe place þare 
als þe foresaide stode, 
he luked in betwene þe barreȝ 
of yrnne and saw, 
bifore þe horse, 
mens hend̛ and fete, 
& oþer of þaire membris, 
liggand̛ scatered̛ here & thare, 
and he had̛ grete wonder þareoff.

And he putt in his hande bitwene þe barreȝ, 
And þe horse strekede 
oute his nekke, 
als ferre als he myghte, 
and likked̛ Alexander hand̛; 
and he knelid̛ doun̛ on̛ his kneesse, 
and bihelde Alexander in þe vesage langly.

And Alexander vnderstode wele þe wiƚƚ of þe horse, 
and opynd̛ the barreȝ, 
and went into þe horse, 
and straked̛ him softely on þe bakke 
wit his riȝte hand̛; 
And belyfe þe horse 
wexe wonderly meke tiƚƚ Alexander; 
and riȝte as a honde wiƚƚ couche 
when̛ his maister biddes hym, 
so dide he tiƚƚ Alexander; 
and Alexander lukede besides hym, 
& sawe a sadiƚƚ & a brydeƚƚ hyng thare; 
and he tuke & dyd̛þam̛ on̛ hym̛, 
& leppe one his bakke 
& rade furthe on̛ hym.

And when̛ the kynge Philippe sawe hym do so, 
he said̛ vntiƚƚ hym 
'Mi son̛ Alexander' 
quoþ he: 
'Aƚƚ þe ansuers of our goddeȝ 
are fulfillede in the! 
For when̛ I ame dede, 
þou mon̛ regne after me' 
And Alexander ansuerd; 
& said̛ 'I pray the, 
Fader,' 
quoþ he, 
'ordeyne me horse & men̛, 
for I gaa seke dedeȝ of armeȝ.' 
'For sothe' 
quoþ þe kynge wit a glade chere, 
'Take þe a hundreth horse, 
and xl thosandeȝ pounde of golde; 
and take wit the of þe worthieste knyghteȝ 
þat langeȝ to me, 
and wendis furthe.' 
And he didd̛so.

And he tuke wit hym 
also a philosopℏre þat highte Eufestius, 
whilke he traysted̛ mekiƚƚ in, 
And twelue childre 
þat he chese 
to be his playfers, 
and went hym furthe, 
and come intiƚƚ a contreth 
þat es called Polipone.

And when̛ the kynge of þe land̛ herd̛ teƚƚ, 
þat swilke men̛ ware entred̛ 
into his rewme in swilke araye, 
he raysed̛ a gret Oste, 
and come agaynes Alexander 
for to feghte wit hym̛.

And when̛ he come nerehand̛ hym, 
he said̛ vntiƚƚ hym.
'Teƚƚ me' quoþ he 
'whatt þou ert ?' 
And Alexander ansuerd̛ 
'I am Alexander' 
quoþ he 
'þe son̛ of Philippe, 
þe kynge of Macedoyne.' 
'And what hopeȝ þou þat I be ?' 
quoþ þe kynge tiƚƚ hym.
And Alexander ansuerd̛.

'Þou ert kynge 
of Arridouns' 
quoþ he.

'Neuerþelesse,

For men̛ seeȝ ofte tymes men̛

'Þou sais riȝte wele' 
quoþ þe kynge.

'Take hede to thyn̛ awen̛ selfe!' 
And Alexander ansuerd̛ & said 
'Ga hethen̛ away fra me' 
quoþ he 
'for þou can̛ say noghte to mee, 
ne I hafe noghte

And þan̛ þe kyng was worder wrathe, 
And said tiƚƚAlexander 
'Luke on me' 
quoþ he 
'þat spekes to the: 
Fore I swere the be my Fader hele, 
& I anes spitte in thi face, 
þou schale dye.' 
And wit þat he spitte 
at Alexander, 
& said̛: 
'Take þe þare, 
þou biche whelpe, 
þat þe semeȝ tiƚƚ hafe.' 
And Alexander stepped̛ furthe, 
& said̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛.

'For þou' quoþ he 
'hase dispised me, 
bycause I ame littiƚƚ; 
I swere þe,

and owþer I schaƚƚ wyn̛

& brynge it vnder my subieccionn̛, 
or þou schaƚƚ make me subiecte vnto þe.' 
And þare þay assignede day of Bateƚƚe; 
and ayther of þam̛ 
went hame fra oþer.

And agaynes þe day of Bateƚƚe, 
Alexander, 
bi ascent & ordynance of kynge Philippe, 
gadird a grete Oste, 
& went to the place þare þe Bateƚƚe was assigned, 
and fand aƚƚ redy þare, 
kyng Nicoƚƚ and his oste.

And þay trumpped̛ 
vp appon̛ bathe þe parties, 
and bigan̛ to feghte, 
& many men̛ ware slaen̛ on̛ bathe þe sydeȝ.

Bot at þe laste, 
Alexander hade þe felde, 
& tuke kyng Nichoƚƚ, 
& gart smytte of his heued̛, 
& went intiƚƚ his land, 
and conquered it; 
and his knyghtes went 
and coround̛ hym kynge þareoff.

And sythen̛ he went hame tiƚƚ his fader, 
kyng Philippe, 
and fand̛ hym sittand̛ 
at the mete at a bridale: 
For he had put awaye 
fra hym his wyfe Olympias, 
Alexander moder, 
and taken̛ hym anoþer þat highte Cleopatra; 
And Alexander went into þe hauƚƚe, 
and said vnto þe kynge Philipp̛: 
'Fader,' 
quoþ he, 
'I pray ȝow, 
þat for a rewarde of my firste iournee 
þat I hafe now made, 
ȝee graunte me to take my Moder Olympias agayne vnto ȝow, 
& do to hir as awe 
to be done to a qwenne, 
rathere þan̛ I gyffe hir to anoþer kynge; 
so þat I be noȝte ȝoure enemy for euer.

For this weddyng, 
þat ȝe hafe now made here, 
es vnlefuƚƚ!' 
When̛ he hadd̛ said̛ thir wordes, 
ane of þe þat satt 
at þe kynges burde, 
whase name was Lesias, 
ansuerd̛ & said̛ to þe kyng: 'lord̛' quoþ he 
'þou schall hafe a son̛ of Cleopatra, 
and he schaƚƚ regne after þe !' 
Alexander, than̛, 
was gretly greuede 
at his wordes, 
and wit a wardrere 
þat he hade in his hande, 
he went tiƚƚ hym 
and kellede hym.

When̛ kyng Pℏilippe sawe this, 
he was gretly stirred̛,

Bot onane he feƚƚe down̛; 
and ay þe nerre Alexander

And þan̛ Alexander said vntiƚƚ hym: 
'Philippe' quoþ he 
'how es it soo, 
that þou, 
þat hase wonn̛ wit dynt of swerde aƚƚe Grece, 
ne hase now

And þan̛ aƚƚ þe hauƚƚe was troubbled, 
and the brydale letted.

And Alexander went abowte þe hauƚƚe, 
and keste doun̛ þe bourdeȝ

and tuke Cleopatra, 
and schotte hir oute

And the kynge Philippe, 
for sorowe þat he tuke tiƚƚ, 
feƚƚe grefe seke.

And a littiƚƚ afterwardeȝ, 
Alexander went tiƚƚ hym 
for to vesett hym & comforthe hym, 
and said̛ vntiƚƚ hym 'Philippe,' 
quoþ he, 
'if aƚƚ it be noȝte semely,

It es fully my consaile

For vnkyndely me thynnke

And when̛ Philippe herd̛ þir wordes, 
his hert tendird̛, 
& he bigane to wepe.

And þan̛ Alexander went 
tiƚƚ his Moder Olympyas, 
and said̛ vntiƚƚ hir: 
'Be noȝte ferde' 
quoþ he 
'ne be noȝte heuy to my fader,

And when̛ be hade sayde thus, 
he ledd̛ hir furthe to þe kyng Philippe.

And he tuk & kyssid hir, 
and thus was scho reconnselde vntiƚƚ hym agayne.

After þis, 
þare come messengers Fra Darius, 
þe emperour of Perse, 
to kyng Philippe, 
and asked̛ hym tribute 
And Alexander answerd̛ 
to thir messengers, 
& saide, 
'Saise to Darius, 
ȝour lorde,' 
quoþ he, 
'þat sen̛ þe tyme þat Philippe son̛ 
was waxen̛ of age

and so es Darius pryuede of his trybute.' 
And thir messengers 
herd̛ thir wordes; 
þay hade grete wounder of

In þe mene tyme tythyngeȝ come to kyng Philippe, 
þat Ermonye,

And he garte semble a grete Oste, 
and sent Alexander thedir þare wit to feghte wit þam̛, 
and to putt þam̛ agayne vnder his subieccionn̛.

Alexander than̛went wit this Oste tiƚƚ 
Ermony & broghte it agayne in subieccion̛, 
as it was bifore.

An in þe mene tyme, 
whils he was þare, 
a lorde of Macedoyne

a strange man̛ & a balde, 
suget vnto Philippe, 
and bade of lange tyme couette

conspirede agaynes þe kynge, 
and come with a grete multytude 
of folke appon̛ þe kynge, 
to fordo hym.

And when̛ tythyngeȝ here of come to kyng Philippe, 
he went to mete hym

And when̛ he sawe þe grete multitude 
þat Pansamy hade wit hym, 
he turned̛& fledd̛, 
and Pansamy persued̛ after hym̛, 
and ouerhied̛ hym, 
and strake hym

and ȝitt ife aƚƚ he were greuosely wonded̛, 
he dyed̛ noȝte alsone, 
bot he laye halfe dede in the waye.

And than þe Macedoynes, 
þat wenede he bade bane dade, 
made mekiƚƚ sorowe.

And when þis iournee was done 
Pansamy was gretly empridede þare offe, 
& went in to þe kynges palace 
for to take þe qwene Olympias oute of it 
and hafe hir with hym.

And euen̛ þe same tyme, 
Alexander come fra Hermony, 
& sawe swylke

and hyed̛ hym faste towarde þe kynges palace, 
and when Olympias herd̛ teƚƚe þat Alexander hir son̛

& was comande nere, 
Scho went furthe of þe palace 
at a preuee posterne to mete hir son̛, 
and to welcome hym hame.

And alsone als scho come nere hym, 
scho criede appon̛ hym̛ & said̛.

'A A, my son Alexander, 
whare es þe grace & þe fortune

þat es to say,

And alsone the worde come to Pansamy

and he went furthe of palace for to mete hym̛.

And also faste als Alexander sawe hym,

& slewe hym.

And ane of þe Oste said̛ tiƚƚ Alexander: 
'Philippe þi fader'

'lyas dade in þe felde.' 
And þan Alexander went

And þan̛ he began̛ faste for to wepe.

And Philippe luked apon̛ hym̛, 
& said̛

'wit a glade hert may now dye, 
for þat þou so soune hase venged̛ my dede,' 
& euen̛ wit þat worde he ȝalde þe gaste.

And Alexander wirchipfully gert hym be entered̛.

When kyng Philippe was entered, 
Alexander went and sett hym in his trone, 
and gerte calle byfore hym 
alle þe folke 
þat was gaderd̛ thedir, 
lordes & oþer, 
and said̛ vnto þam̛ on þis wyse.

'Men̛,' 
quoþ he, 
'of Macedoyne of Tracy,

And when̛ þe lordes

And þan̛ Alexander answerd̛ & said̛:

When̛ he had said thir wordes 
aƚƚ men̛ alowed̛ his hie witte and hally þay assentede to hym

Sone after Alexander assemblede a grete Oste, 
& went bi Schippe towardeȝ Ytaly, 
and als he come by Calcedoyne, 
he assaylled̛ it reȝte strangly, 
and þe folke of Calcedoyne

Bot at the laste Alexander wan̛ the Citee, 
and fra thethyn̛ he Schippede intiƚƚ Italy.

And alsone als þe Romaynes

and the grete lordes of þe lande

and went vntiƚƚ hym̛, 
and presant hym wit

And than Alexander tuke trybute of þe Romaynes, 
and of aƚƚe the folkes

& lefte þam̛ in gude pesse.

Fra thethyn he Schippede intiƚƚ Affrice,

and þarefore als swa saye, 
eneil sodeynly he conquerid̛

And fra Affric he went by Schippe tiƚƚ ane Ile, 
þat es called̛ Frontides, 
for to consaile wit a godd̛ þat þay called̛ Amon̛.

And as Alexander & his men̛ went towardeȝ þe temple of þis forsaid̛ godd̛, 
þay mett in þe waye a grete hert 
þe whilke Alexander bad his men̛ sla wit arowes.

And þay schott at hym; 
bet nane of þam̛ myghte hitt hym.

And þan̛ Alexander tuke a 
bowe & schotte at hym & hitt

And þan̛ Alexander went into þe temple, 
& made sacrafyce of þis hert vnto godd̛ Amon, 
and bysoughte hym 
þat he schulde gyffe hym ansuares.

When̛ Alexander hade made his prayers þare to godd̛ Amon̛, 
he went wit his Oste intiƚƚ

In þe whilke were feftene gude townues, 
& þay bade twelne grete reuers

and at þe entree of þam̛ into þe see

And on þe same nyghte,

'Alexander,' 
quoþ he, 
'may þou take þis montayne on þi

Quoþ Alexander, 
'how myghte any man̛ do pat?' And Serapis ansuerd̛ & said̛, 
'righte as þis montayne

And than̛ Alexander prayed hym 
þat he walde prophycye

Serapis ansuerd and said, 
'It es noghte spedfuƚƚ tiƚƚ

For if he knewe it, perauenture,

When̛ Alexander wakkened̛ of his dreme, 
he was reghte heuy, 
and sent þe maste substance 
of his Oste to þe Cite 
of Askalon̛ 
and bad þaim̛ habide hym thare, 
and hym

In the mene tyme , 
Egipcyens herd̛ of þe comynges of Alexander, 
& þay went agaynes

wirchipfully.

And when̛ Alexander come intiƚƚ Egipte, 
he fand ane ymage

and he askede þe Egipciens 
whase ymage it was,

'It es þe ymage,' 
quop þay, 
'of Anectanabus 
that was kynge of Egipte noȝte lange sythen̛ gane,

For sothe quoþ Alexander, 
'Auectanabus was my Fader.' 
And þan he knelid doun̛ with grete 
reuerence & kyssed̛ þe ymage.

Fra thethyn̛ he went 
wit his Oste to Surry.

But þe Surriens agaynestude hym 
and faghte wit hym̛ 
and slewe many of his knyghtes.

Neuer þe lesse Alexander had þe victorye.

And þan̛ he went to Damaske, 
& Ensegged̛ it & wanne it, 
and fra thethyn̛ he went to 
Sydon & wan it.

And þan̛ he went 
vnto þe Citee of Tyre 
and layde Ensegge abowte it, 
and þis Ensegge he laye many a day.

And thare his Oste suffred̛ many dysesseȝ.

For þat Cite was so strange 
in itselfe bycause of þe ground̛, 
þat it was sett apon̛, 
and bycause of grete 
towres & many þat ware abowte it, 
and also bicause it was so enclosed̛ wit the see 
þat it myghte noghte lightly be wonnen̛ 
by nane assawte.

Alexander þan̛ vmbithoghte hym, 
one what wyse he myghte best com̛ to for to destruy þis citee, 
and he gerte make a grete basteƚƚ of tree, 
and sett it apon̛ schippes

so þat þare myghte no shippeȝ come nere the hauen̛ 
for to vetaille þe Citee 
or suppoeƚƚ it wit men̛ bycause of þe basteƚƚe.

In þe mene tyme Alexander Oste 
hade grete defawte of vetayƚƚs, 
and þan̛ he sent lettres vnto Iadus, 
þat at that tyme was 
bischoppe & gouernoure of þe Iewes, 
and prayede hym 
for to suppoeƚƚ hym wit som̛ men̛, 
and also þat he walde send̛ sum̛ vetails

and he scholde pay

and þat he scholde also send̛ hym the tribute 
þat he scholde gyffe Darius þe emperour of Perse.

For hym ware better, 
he said̛, 
hafe his frenchippe

The Bischope þan̛ of þe Iewes ansuerd̛ þe messangers þat broghte hym þe

quoþ he, ' 
made athe to Darius, 
þat, whils he leffeȝ, 
I schaƚƚ neuer bere armes agaynes hym̛, 
and þarefore I ne may noȝte do agaynes myn̛ Athe.' 
The Messagers þan̛ went till 
Alexander & talde hym þe bischopes ansuere, 
and he was 
greued̛ & said̛ 
'I make myn̛ avowe,' 
quþ he, 
'vntiƚƚ oure goddes,

whethir it es better to þam̛

And he callede a duke,

And ane Sampson,

Þay went in to þe vale, 
and gadird̛ to gedir catell

And he þat was lorde of þe cuntre, 
Theosellas bi name, 
raysed̛ a grete multitude of folke 
and mett

Bot Melagere & his felaws 
at þat tym̛ had þe better.

And ane þat highte Caulus went baldly to Theosellas, 
& smate of his heued̛.

Aƚƚ this was done bot 
a littiƚƚ fra þe citee of Gadir.

And þan̛ Bertyne, 
lorde of þe citee, 
seand̛ this, 
was gretely stirrede 
and ischewede owte of þe

and sett vp a schowte

that aƚƚe þe erthe trembled̛ witaƚƚe.

And̛ when̛ þe Macedoyns saw

þay were reȝte ferde.

And þan Melagere walde hafe sent a Messangere to þaire lorde Alexander, 
for to

bot he mygte fynd̛ na man̛

Than thir twa batalles met 
Samen̛ & faughte togedir, 
and thare was Sampson slaen, and Bertyne.

And þe Macedoyns wit þe grete multitude 
of þaire enemys ware dreuen̛ abakke, 
and lyke for to be dreuen̛

And ane of þe grekkes, 
þat highte Arttes,

wann̛ hym owte of the 
Bataile & went in alle þe haste, 
þat he myghte, 
tiƚƚ Alexander & talde hym þat þe 
Grekkes & þe Macedoynes ware in poynte to be mescheuede, 
bot if he suppoellde þam̛ þe tittere.

And than Alexander lefte þe segge of Tyre, 
and went wit his Oste 
to þe vale of Iosaphat, 
and fand̛ his men̛ riȝte harde 
bystadde wit þaire enemys.

And he and his Oste vmbylapped̛ 
alle þaire enemys, 
and daunge þam̛ 
doun̛ & slewe þam̛ ilke a moder son̛.

And when̛ he had so done 
he turned̛ agayne vnto Tyre, 
and fande the Bastelle, 
þat he hade made in þe See, 
dongen̛ doune to þe grounde.

For alson̛ als Alexandere was gane fra Tire 
to þe vale of Iosaphat, 
Balan̛ þat was lorde of Tyre 
ischewid̛ oute of þe citee 
wit thee folke þareof, 
& assailled̛ the basteƚƚ manfully, 
and tuk it & dange it doune.

And when̛ Alexander sawe that, 
he was gretly angerde, 
and his hert wonder heuy, 
and so ware aƚƚe þe Macedoynes and the Grekes.

In so mekiƚƚ thay ware nerehand̛ 
in dispeire 
for to wyn̛ þe citee, 
and ware in poynte to hafe riffen up þe segge.

And one þe nyghte nexte suande,

als he laye & slept, 
dremyd̛ þat he hadd̛ in his hand̛ a grape, 
þe whilke hym thoghte

& alsone þare ran̛ oute of it

And when̛ Alexander wakned̛, 
he called̛ tiƚƚ hym̛ a 
Philosophre & talde hym his dreme.

And þe Philosophre ansuerde, 
'be balde,' 
quoþ he, 
'& lefe noȝte to ensegge Tyre,

and keste vnder thi fete, 
and trade þareone,

and þarefore be nathynge abaiste.' 
When Alexander herd̛ thire wordes, 
he was gretly comforthed̛, 
and vmbithoghte hym̛ one whate wyse

And than̛ he garte make anoþer basteƚƚe

and strangere þan þe toþer was.

For it was hiere 
þan̛ þe hegheste towre

And þis basteƚe was tyede wit a hundrethe ankers.

Þan̛ Alexander gert armede hyn̛

And alsone als þay sawe hym entire in to þe citee, 
þay scholde aƚƚ

And when̛ aƚƚ men̛ weren̛ redy, 
hee gerte smyte soundere þe cabiƚƚs þat þe basteƚƚe was tyed̛ wit, 
& þe wawes of þe see bare it to þe walles of þe Citee.

And Alexander 
delyuerlye stert apon̛ walles, 
whare Balan̛ stode, 
and ran̛ apon̛

and keste hym ouer þe walles 
into þe dyke of þe citee.

And when̛ þe

For þe Tyreyenes

And on̛ this wyse was þe citee taken̛ 
and doungen̛ doune to þe erthe.

Fra þe segge of Tyre 
Alexander & his men̛ went to þe citee of Gaȝa and assailed̛it, 
& wit schorte while þay wan̛ it.

And Fra thethyn̛ hyed̛ hym towardeȝ Ierusalem

Qwhen̛ þe Bischoppe of þe Iewes herde

And sythen̛ he commandid̛ þam̛ þat þay schuld̛ com̛ to þe temple,

And þay did̛ soo.

And on þe nyghte nexte after, 
when þe Bischoppe hadd̛ made his sacrafice, 
and was lyand̛ in prayers,

When̛ þe bischoppe wakened̛ of his slepe,

And þay did̛ so.

For þay arayed̛ þe streteȝ

And he lighte off his horse, 
and went bi hym ane to þe iewes, 
And knelid̛ down̛ to þe erthe 
and wirchippede þe hye name of godd, 
þat he saw þar wretyn̛ apon̛ þe bischopes heued̛.

And þan̛ alle þe iewes 
knelid̛ doun̛ & saluste Alexander 
and cried aƚƚ wit a voyce: 
'lyff lyffe,' 
quoþ þay, 
'grete Alexander, lyffe,

lyffe he þat saƚƚ ouercom̛ aƚƚ men̛

Prynce maste gloryous 
and maste worthy of aƚƚ þe princeȝ þat regneȝ apon̛ erthe.' 
When̛ þe kyngeȝ of Surry saw þis, 
þay hadd̛ grete wonder þareoff.

And a prynce of Alexanders, 
þat highte Parmenon̛, 
said̛ vntiƚƚ Alexander: 
'Mi lorde þe Emperour,' 
quoþ he, 
'we mervelle vs gretely þat þou, 
wham̛ aƚƚ men̛ wirchippeȝ and lowteȝ,

And Alexander ansuered̛, 
'I wirchipe noȝ hym,' 
þis quoþ he, 
'Bot Gdd̛, 
whase state he presenteȝ.

For when̛ I was in Macedoyne, 
and vmbithoghte me, 
on̛ what wyse I myȝte conquere Assye, 
I saw hym slepand̛, 
in swilk

and he lete as he sett noȝte by me, 
bot went baldely furthe bi me.

And for I see nane

I suppose it be he

And þarefore I trowe

And aƚƚ thyngeȝ þat I caste

and wele bryng it to end̛.

And þis es þe cause I wirchipped hym.' 
And when̛ he hadd̛ said̛ thies wordes, 
he went into þe citee 
wit the bischope & þe presteȝ, 
and went into þe temple 
þat Salamon̛ made.

And as þe bischope teched̛ hym̛ he offred̛ sacrafice unto Godd̛.

And þe bischope tuke Alexander 
in hande a buke of þe prophicye of Daniel , 
in þe whilke he fande wretyn̛,

And Alexander was reghte gladde,

And þan̛ he gaffe þe

And badd̛ þe bischope ashe

And the bischope askede

and he graunted̛ it.

And þan̛ pe bischoppe askede

& he graunted̛ hym

Alexander than̛ went fra Ierusalem, 
& lefte thare Andromac his Messagere, and hym 
selfe & his Oste went to þe oþer citeȝ 
þat ware in þe lande of Iudee, 
and at ilke a citee 
þat he come to, 
he was wirchipfully ressayued̛.

In þe mene tyme þe Surryens 
þat fledd̛ fra Alexander, 
went to Perse, 
and̛ talde þe emperour Darius 
how Alexander hadd̛ done to þam̛.

And Darius spirred̛ thaym̛ of his

and þay schewed̛ hym purtrayed̛

And alsone als Darius sawe it, 
he dispysed̛ Alexander bycause of his littiƚƚ stature, 
and belyfe he gerte write a lettre 
and sent it till Alexander.

And þarewit he sent hym 
a handbaƚƚ & oþer certane Iapeȝ in scorne.

And þis is þe tenour 
of þe lettre 
þat he sent tiƚƚ hym.

'Darius, kyng of kynges,

When̛ þe messangers

þay gaffe hym the lettres,

And Alexander tuke þe lettres,

And when̛ Alexander sawe þam̛ so heuy

he saide vnto þam: 
'a a,

When Alexander had̛ saide thir wordeȝ he bade his knyghtis

Þan̛ kyng Alexander

Apon þe morne,

When̛ þis lettre was wreten̛,

And þan̛ he come

And fra thethyn̛ he come tiƚƚ Ysaury,

And Alexander went

and thare he tuk wit hym a certane of men̛ of Armes, 
and went so thurgh Asye,

And so he come into Frigy, 
and went into þo temple of þe son̛, and thare he made sacrafyce to þe son̛.

Fra thethyn̛, he come to a reuere, 
þat es called̛ Stamandra, 
and þare he said̛ tiƚƚ his men.

'Blyste mote ȝe be',

'þat hase getyn̛ þe

For þou hase done in þi tyme ma wirchipfuƚƚ thyngeȝ,

And Alexander & said̛ 
'Me ware leuer,'

After this he remonede 
wit his Oste into Macedoyne, 
& fande his Modir Olympias wele couerd̛ of hir sekenes,

And than̛ he ordeyned hym̛ for to wende agayne into Persy, 
And keste hym for to logge

The men̛ of þe Citee, 
when̛ þay herde telle of his commynge, 
þay sperede þe ȝates of þe Citee, 
and wachede þe citee one ilke a syde.

And when̛ Alexander saw þat,

And þe burgeȝ of þe Citee, 
when̛ þay sawe þat þe citee

And þan̛ Alexander said̛ vnto þam̛ agayn̛.

'Iffe ȝe wiƚƚ,'

And þan̛ þe Citaȝenes opened̛ þe ȝates.

Fra thethen̛ þay went to Comnoliche.

And fra thethyn̛ to Bihoy, 
and so to Caldiple.

Syne þay come tiƚƚ a grete reuere, 
whare Alexander Oste hadd̛ grete defaute of vetaƚƚs, 
and þan̛ his knyghtis murnede gretely

When̛ he hadd̛ aƚƚ saide,

Fra thethyn̛ þay

And Alexander went into a temple of Apollo; 
whare als he aghteled̛ to hafe made Sacrafice, 
and hafe hadd̛ ansuere

Bot a woman þat hiȝte Ȝacora,

On þe Morne Alexander come to þe 
temple & made his sacrafice.

And Apollo said̛ tiƚƚ Alexander, 'Hercules,' 
quoþ he.

And Alexander ansuered̛, & said̛, 
'Now þat þou calleȝ me Hercules,' 
quoþ he: 
'I see wele þat aƚƚ thyn̛

Fra thethyn Alexander went till a citee þat es called̛ Thebea, 
and said vnto þe folke of þe citee: 
'Sendeȝ me furthe,' 
quoþ he, 
'foure hundreth knyghtis,

And when̛ þe Thebeans herd̛ thir wordeȝ, 
þay spered̛ þe ȝates of þe citee,

and cried̛ lowde þat Alexander myghte here: 
'Alexander,'

'bot if gaa hethyn̛ fra vs,

When Alexander herde this,

'þat ere so mekiƚƚ praysed̛ & commended̛ of strenghe, 
Spere ȝe ȝour

When̛ he hadd̛ saide thir wordeȝ,

And he ordeynde oþer foure hundreth men̛,

And hym selfe,

And belyfe fra þay

In þe Oste of Alexander was,

a grete enemy to þe citee.

He, when̛ he sawe þe citee bryne, 
made righte mery.

Bot a man̛ of the citee

Alexander behelde hym,

'whareto syngeȝ þou me þis sange ?' 
'A Alorde,'

'to luke

And þan̛ Alexander was wonder wrathe, 
and bad dynge þe walles

And when̛ þay had so done þay

and ane of þe worthieste men̛ of þe citee,

Bot þe Thebeens

Apollo ansuerde,

'he þat schaƚƚ bygge þis citee agayne

And when̛ he hase geten̛ thre victories, 
he saƚƚ onane

Alexander fra þe citee of Thebe, 
went to Corynthe, 
and þare come tiƚƚ hym certane lordes, 
prayand̛ hym þat he walde

And to þis Ilke wrestillynge 
þare come folke witowtten̛ nowmer.

And when̛ aƚƚ men̛ were gadirde,

'whilk of ȝowe,'

Clitomarus þan̛,

And Alexander bad hym ga to.

And Clitomarus went into þe place, 
and þe firste man̛ þat come in his hande, 
at the first tourne he threwe hym wide open̛.

And Alexander said vntiƚƚ hym: 
'Caste thre men̛,'

Þan̛ þare come anoþer man̛

And one þe same wyse he seruede þe thirde.

And þan Alexander gart sett

'My name,'

When Alexander herde þat he saide vntiƚƚ hym: 
'Thou noble wristiller,'

'whi arte þou callede wit owtten̛ citee.' 
'Wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,'

Bot now,

And when̛ herde this,

And þan he garte his sergeanteȝ make a crye

Fra Corinthe, Alexander and his oste remowed̛ tiƚƚ 
a citee þat highte Platea,

And Alexander went to þe temple of Diane, 
and fande þare a woman̛ preste,

And when̛ sawe Alexander,

'þou arte welcomme.

Þou schaƚƚ conquere aƚƚ þe werlde.' 
One þe morne 
Scrassageras went to þe same temple, 
and alsone als þe preste sawe hym, 
scho saide vntiƚƚ hym: 
'Scrassageras,

And when̛ he herde þis

'for to be preste here.

Alexander come to þe ȝisterdaye,

And to me þou sais,

And scho ansuerd; 
& saide, 
'Beeȝ noȝte angry to me,'

'for aƚƚ þis buse be fulfilled̛,

A littiƚƚ after it feƚƚe þat Alexander was gretely angrede at Scrassageras, 
and tuke fra hym his lordchipe, 
& Scrassageras went to þe cite of Atheneȝ, 
and sare wepande he complenede hym

And þan̛ þe Atheneanes ware wonder towardes Alexander, 
and made grete

bot if he restorede Scrassageras

Alexander remowed̛ his Oste fra Platea

and when̛ herde teƚƚe

and manaced̛ hym, 
he wrate vnto þam̛ a lettre þat spak one this wyse. ' 
Alexander, þe son of Philippe

Fra þe tyme 
þat oure Fadir was dedde, 
& we were sett in þe Trone

And thase þat walde noȝte submytt

And now þis oþer daye as we went fra

The Athenyenes redd̛ þis lettre

And ane, þat highte Eschiƚƚe,

and said̛: 
'It es fully my conseƚƚ,'

Alle þe folke þan̛

And he stude vp,

And þan̛ he said̛ vnto þam̛.

For aƚƚ men knawes wele

When̛ þe Athenyenes had herde þir wordeȝ,
