and thys doughter was delyuerd vnto a noble lady for to be nourysshed
wyth hyr  the whyche lady was of the sayd cyte and had a ly∣tel
doughter of the age of vy∣enne the whyche was named y∣sabel  & so the
fayre vyēne was nourysshed wyth the same ysabel from hyr tender age vnto
many yere after  & soo grete loue was bytwene them bothe that they
called eche other systers  & the fayre vyenne grewe and encrea∣••ed euer in souerayn beawte & gentylnesse  so that the renomee of hyr
excellent beawte flourys∣shed not onely thurgh al fraūce but also thurgh
al the Royame


      

of englond & other contrees  It happed after she was xv yere of age
that she was desyred to ma¦ryage of many knyʒtes & grete lordes  & at
that tyme was in the daulphyns courte emonge many hys knyʒtes  a noble
mā of auncyent lygnage & of fayr londes  the whiche was wel by∣loued of
the daulphyn & of alle the lordes of the lande and was called syr
Iames  thys noble man had a moche fayr sone that had to name Parys  &
hys fa∣der made hym to be taught in al good custommes  and whan he was
xviij yere of age he was a∣dressed to the dyscyplyne of ar∣mes  &
demened hym self so no∣bly & worthely in al maner de∣des of chyualrye
that wythin a shorte tyme after he was doubed knyght by the hande of the
sayd lord daulphyn  Noo fayte of knyghthode ne none aduenture of
chyualrye happed after but that he founde hym self at it in soo moche
that the renommee of hym ranne thurgh al the world & men sayd he was one
of the best knyʒtes y^t myght be founde in ony contree  & helde hym
self ryght clene in armes and lyued chastly & Ioyefully  & had euer
aboute hym fowles hawkes and houndes for hys dysporte to alle maner of
huntyng suffysaunt y∣nough for a duc or for an erle  and thurgh hys
prowesse and hardynes he was acqueynted & knowen of many other grete
lor¦des  and emonge alle other he was gretely and louyngly ac∣queynted
with a yonge knyght of the cyte of vyenne that hyght Edward  and were
bothe of one age and moche loued eche other  and as two brethern of
armes wente euer to gyder there as they knewe ony Ioustyng or appertyse
of armes to be had for to gete honour  And wete it wel that besyde
theyr worthynes in armes they were good mu∣sycyens playeng vpon alle
ma∣ner Instrumentes of musyke  and coude synge veray wel  but Parys
passed in al ponytes his felowe Edward  Notwythston¦dyng Edward was
amerous al redy of a noble lady of the courte of braban  but Parys as
yet knewe nought of amorouste but not longe after Venus the goddes of
loue fyred his thouʒt with the hert vnto a noble yong lady  that is to
wete the fayre vyenne the daulphyns doughter of vyennoys that was his
lyege lord  & the more he growed tow∣ard his flouryng age y^e more he
was esprysed & brennyng of her loue for the grrte beaute y^t was in
hyr  But Parys thought euer in hys herte that this loue was not wel
lykly ne cordable  For he was not of so hyghe lygnage as the noble mayden


      

vyenne was of  & therfore Pa∣rys kept hys loue secrete that none shold
perceyue it sauf Ed∣ward his trusty felowe to whom he brake & shewed his
counceyl And the fayre vyenne perceyued not that parys was amerous of
hyr  nor parys also durst ney∣ther shewe nor say nothynge to hyr of
hyt  but the more that he sawe hyr the more grewe y^e fyre of loue
within hym self 


        How Parys and Edward hys felowe played wyth dyuers Instrumētes
        by nyght tofore the chambre of vyenne 

PArys thenne & edward wyth one accorde dyspo¦sed them self for to gyue
somme melodyous myrthe to the noble mayde vyenne  and wyth theyr
musycal Instrumentes  as recourders  they yede by nyght tyme to gyder
toward that parte of the castel where as the fayre vyenne laye in hyr
chambre  and there they sange ful swetely and sowned melodyously theyr
mu∣sycal Instrumentes and pypes  and certeyn the melodye of their
songes and the sowne of theyr Instrument was so playsaunt & so swete
that it passed al other melodye  And whan the daul∣phyn and his wyf &
the fayre vyenne theyr doughter herde this swete and melodyous sowne 
as wel of mās wyces as of dy¦uers Instrumētes they had grete Ioye and
took grete playsyr at it & had grete desyre to knowe what they were that
so grete so∣lace and Ioye made tofore theyr castel  and for to wete &
knowe what they were the daulphyn assygned a day of a feste at the
whyche he sente for alle maner mynstrellys in hys londe  char∣gyng
theym vpon grete payne that they shold come for to playe before hym and
hys barons in hys castel of vyenne  & ••ohan they were al come they played and sange in theyr best wyse  but ••mong them were not foūde tho mynstrelles that the lord daul¦phyn sought
fore  wherof he was sorouful & desyred more to kno∣we what they were
than he dyd afore  And whan vyenne herde alle the mynstrellys of the
bonde that sowned at y^e feste she sayd to ysabel hyr damoysel & preuy
felowe  by my fayth swete syster these mynstrellys playen nouʒt to the
regarde of them that were wonte to come before our cham∣bre  & me
dysplayseth moche that I may not knowe them  for cer∣teynly they come
not hyther for nought  for they loue outher you or me 

WHan the daulphyn vn∣derstode hys doughters wordes he wyllyng to playse
hyr sayd vnto hyr that yf it were possyble she shold kno∣we what they
were that soo


      

sange euery nyght before hyr chambre  wherfore he ordeyned x men of
armes and commaunded them to hyde them self pryuely there as the sowne
was herde  & that they shold brynge to hym other by force or otherwyse
them that made that swete melodye  Now came the nyght that the ij yonge
knyghtes Parys & Ed∣ward that no thynge knewe of thembusshement that was
layed for them came with theyr Instru¦mentes toward the castel & there
they began to synge & sowned theyr Instrumentes so melody∣ously that
grete playsyr it was to here  & whan they had songe and wold haue
retorned thy∣der as they were come fro  the x knyghtes lepte & cam
forth and sa••••wed them curtoyslle sayeng that they nedes must come wyth them for to
speke with their lord the daulphyn  Thenne sayd Pa¦rys to them  Fayr
lordes abyde a lytel whyle  yf it playse you & of vs ye shal haue an 
ansuer Thenne wente Parys & edward a parte and spake to gyder  ye see
fayr brother sayd Parys to Edward in what party we be now and I wold not
that ye shold haue by me ony dysplay syr nor harme  but soo moche I
telle you that or I shold suffre me to be ledde tofore the daul∣phyn I
had leuer deye  therfore fayr brother aduyse we what is beste for to
do  & edward heryng parys wordes sayd  brother myn haue noo fere of no
thynge and lete vs doo as ye wyl  Thenne sayd they to the x men of
armes lordes thurgh your curtosye suf∣fre vs to retorne thyder as we
came fro  for we be at my lord the daulphyns playsyr & of all the
lordes & barons of his courte but in ony maner as for thys tyme we may
not fulfylle hys commaundement 

WHan the sayd x men of armes saw the ij knygh¦tes dysobeyssaunt  they
ansuerd to them ye shal now come to hym other wyth your wylle or by
force  and bygan to pulle oute theyr swerdes & came ayenst the two
yonge knyghtes that naked were from al armes sauf theyr swerdes and
theyr bowclers  wherwyth they couerd them and so manfully deffended
theyr bodyees that they hurte & wounded sore al the ten armed men in so
moche that they maad them alle to voyde and flee fro the place whether
they wold or not  And on the morowe erly the ten men of armes came
tofore the daulphyn alle woun∣ded and sore hurt  And they re¦counted to
hym how two yonge men onely had arayed them so and how they nedes must
flee for fere of theyr lyues 


      

wherof the daulphyn was ryght angry to see them so sore hurt & took
grete dysplaysyr of it  and thought wel that the sayd two yonge
knyghtes were of grete strengthe and vertue  wherfore he comanded an
hondred men to be redy for to espye & take them the nyght folowyng yf
they came a∣geyn chargyng that none hurte shold be doon to them  but
after theyr songe doon  they shold be brought vnto hym  but thys
en¦terpryse came to none effect  for the two yonge knyghtes came not
ageyn but kepte alle that they had doon secrete  whan the fayre vyēne
sawe that she myʒt not knowe what these mynstrel∣lys were she thought
they were somme grete lordes that were a∣merous of hyr  & she & hyr
da∣moysel ysabel spake of none o∣ther thynge than of these myn¦strelles
and had grete playsyr to talke of them  Parys seyng he durst not say
nor shewe the grete loue that he had to the fayr vyenne  thought he
wold hyde hys courage from hyr  wherfore he took acqueyntaunce wyth the
bysshop of Saynt Laurence the whyche lerned hym holy scryp∣ture  The
daulphyn thenne seyng hys doughter ful tryste & pen∣syful for thys that
she myght not knowe the sayd mynstrelles that so melodyously played
to∣fore hyr chambre  he ordeyned a Ioustyng place wythin his cyte of
vyenne and made lystes and scaffoldes to be sette vp & sente his
herauldes in fraunce in En∣glond and in normandye to a∣nounce & shewe
vnto al knyʒtes and gentylmen that wold doo faytes of armes and of
chyual∣rye for loue of al ladyes and da¦moyselles  that the Ioustes
shold be holden the fyrst day of may  in the cyte of vyenne  And he
that shold doo best in armes  shold haue of the Daulphyns doughter a
shelde of crystalle of grete valurr  and a garlond wyth roses and
floures of fyn gold  And wete ye wel that vyenne the noble and fayr
may¦den was ryght gladde of the Ioustes that hyr fader ordeyned for hyr
sake  Fro grete talent and desyre she had to knowe hym that was soo
amerous of hyr  and she thought he wold be at the sayd fyrst day of may
at vyenne 

After the messagers that had pronounced the Ioustes were comen ageyn to
the cyte of vyenne  the moost parte of the knyghtes and gentylmen of
the Royame of Fraunce of En∣glond and of Normandye made them redy for to
come to the cyte of Vyenne to the sayd Ioustes  And in especyal many
no∣ble barons of the royame of En∣glond & of france that amerous


      

were of the fayre vyenne for the renomme of hyr grete beaulte  came to
the sayd Ioustes wyth ryche and noble araye  emonge whome was Iohan duc
of bour∣bon neuew to the kyng of fraūce Edward the kynges sone of
en¦glond  Anthony sone to the erle of prouence  Gherard the mar∣quys
sone of Mountferat  and wyllyam sone to the duc of Car∣nes  Paris
thēne knowyng this noble assemble and the Ioustes that shold be the
fyrst day of M••y thought in hym self whe∣ther he shold goo thyder or not  but the
grete loue that he had to the fayre vyenne constrayned hym therto 
Neuertheles he took counceyl of Edward his felowe the whyche answerd to
hym  yf ye goo I wyl holde you compa∣••ye thyder  but we must departe secretly that we be not knowen  and
anone they made redy theyr harnoys & pourueyed theym of good horses
whiche they harney¦sed al in whyt  & none other to∣ken they had on them
whereby they myght be knowen sauf that they were arayed al in whyt & one
lyke that other  The day of the Ioustes thēne approched & al the lordes
& barons afore sayd cam ij dayes before the feste to y^e cyte of vyenne
where the daul∣phyn for loue of them dyd doo make a noble scaffold where
as the fayre vyenne was rychely a∣rayed  & al that sawe hyr were
ameruaylled of hyr  grete beaute To that feste came many noble knyghtes
& squyers clothed and arayed rychely after the guyse of theyr contree 
& there were ma¦ny mynstrellys playeng vpon al maner Instrumentes  &
many good syngars whyche the noble mayde vyenne herkened ful wel For hyr
hert was onely sette to thynke how she myght knowe hym that was hyr
louer  parys thenne came thyder and was or¦deyned for to serue at the
daul∣phyns table where vyenne satte  & wete ye wel that ful gracy∣ously
and curtoysly he serued and kerued before hyr 


        How Parys gate the prys of the Ioustes in the cyte of Vyenne 

WHan the day was comen that the lordes knyghtes & gētylmen shold Iuste
for loue of the ladyes  Parys & Edward yede to a secrete place where
they armed them secretly and syn came to the lystes with theyr badges &
tokens and were horsed and armed ful rychely and wel  Alle other
knyghtes there were knowen by theyr ar¦mes  but the two whyt knygh∣tes
were vnknowen 

The daulphyn thenne commaun¦ded that euery one shold mustre


      

or the Ioustyng began along the felde tofore the ladyes & damoy¦selles 
and soo they mostred ry∣dyng tofore the scaffold of the fayre vyenne &
were so nobly & rychely armed & arayed  and so godely men they were
that euery one sayd  the floure of knyght∣hode may now be seen in thys
place  a emonge al other pryn∣ces Edward of Englond was moost amerous
of al & ryght re¦nōmed in armes  The pucelle Vyenne soyng alle these
noble knyghtes  sayd to hyr damoysel ysabel  Fayr syster whyche of
them al thynke you that moost dooth for the loue of me  & ysa∣bel
ansuerd  honourable lady me semeth he that bereth the lyon of gold in
his armes dooth more for your loue than the other  Certes sayd vyenne
yonder two whyt knyghtes that bere none armes in theyr sheldes are more
to my fantasye than ony of the other alwaye  we shal see now what they
can doo  Thēne were the knyghtes redy to do fayte of armes  And fyrst
an hardy & valyaunte knyght that bare in hys armes a crowne of gold
bygan the fyrst cours  & ayenst hym ranne the good knyght ed∣ward parys
felowe & recoūtred eche other so vygorously y^t they brake bothe theyr
speres  many other mette eche other sodaynlye gyuyng grete strokes 
somme were ouerthrowen to the erthe & somme brake theyr speres wor∣thely
& kept theyr sterops ryght valyauntly  the other recountred eche other
so manfully that bothe hors and man were caste to the grounde  For
euery man dyd hys best to gete worshyp there  Edward the kynges sone of
englond bare hym ful wel and had the better vpon many a knyʒt there 
but the strong knyʒt parys broched hys hors toward hym  and mette hym
so vygo∣rously that atte ende he ouer∣threwe hym & had the better of hym
wherof he gate grete wor∣shyp and was moche praysed for hys grete
prowesse  Thys Ious∣tyng lasted tyl souper tyme  & whan y^t euen cam
many of them were wery of the Iouste & rested them  but parys dyd thēne
more of armes shewyng his meruayl¦lous prowesse than he had doon of al
that day in so moche that none durst approche hym ne with stonde his
appertyse in armes  & so moche he dyd that thonour & prys of the
Ioustes rested & a∣bode in hym that day 


        How the shelde of crystal & the garlond with floures of gold
        were yeuen to Parys as to the best doer in faytes of armes 

THe feste ended  grete wor¦shyp & loenge abode to y^e ij knyʒtes with
y^e whyt


      

armes  and Parys was ledde vnto the scaffold there as vyēne was the
whyche delyuerd hym the shelde of crystal & the gar∣lond wyth floures of
gold that she helde in hyr honde  & thenne parys with Edward his felawe
departed thens in the secretest wyse that they coude and wente to v••arme them to y^e place where they fyrst armed them self  The ••••••ons and knyghtes that were there spake wel of the prowesse & of the
chyualrye of the knygh¦tes with the whyt armes so that the daulphyn &
the other grete lordes had grete desyre to knowe what they were & to
haue theyr acqu••yntaunce  but they depar∣ted so secretly fro the felde that no man
knewe where they were become nor what waye they toke

AFter al thys was thus doon the knyghtes retor¦ned in to theyr contrees
spekyng euer of the ryal feste and chere that the daulphyn had doon to
them  & of the prowesse of the whyt knyghtes & of the ryght souerayn
beaute and no∣blesse of vyenne  And in the mene whyle there moeued a
stryf betwyxte the barons & knyʒtes of Frauunce and of Englond For somme
were there that were amerous of the doughter of the duc of Normandye 
and somme were that loued and bare oute the bealute of the syster of the
kyng of Englond  sayeng she was fayrer than Vyenne was  and other were
there that helde contrarye oppynyon sayeng that the daulphyns doughter
vyenne passed in beaute al other wym∣men in the world  and for this
reason was grete debate & stryf betwyxte the knyʒtes of fraunce & them
of Englond for the beau¦te of these thre damoyselles  Euer multeplyed
& grewe more the bruyt and the renōme of the daulphyn by cause of the
Ioustes and tournoyment doon in his cyte of vyenne  wherof he had grete
Ioye  for they had be moche honourable and playsaunt to al knyghtes 
And Vyenne euer thought in hyr self who myght he be that had goten the
worshyp and prys of the Ious∣tes and sayd to ysabel  Neuer truste me
dere suster but y^e knyʒt to whom I haue yeuen the shelde of crystal and
my garlond is he that so swetely sange for the loue of me tofore our
chambre  for myn hert gyueth it me  and by my fayth syster he is ful
no∣ble and worthy  & in alle hys dedes ryght curtoys and gentyl as we
myght haue seen whylere wherfor I say you my swete sys∣ter that in hym I
haue putte the rote of myn entyere herte  my wylle and al my loue  nor
neuer I shal haue playsyr ne Ioye


      

vnto y^e tyme that I knowe what he is  for my loue is al hys  & of
what so euer estate he be of I neuer shal take myn herte fro hym 
Thenne began she to wayle and syghe for the loue of hym ful tenderly 
for tyl now she had not felte the sparkles of loue that sprange out of
hyr hert  but parys knewe nothyng herof y^t she desyred to haue hym &
to knowe what he was  but he kepte hys loue secrete in hys hert  For
he durst not shewe it vnto hyr wherfore he ledde hys lyf in grete
trystesse and sorowe he went euer in the felawshyp of the bysshop of
saynt Laurence & made semblaunte of nothyng And Iames the fader of
Pa∣rys that had seen the noble feest and the ryal Ioustes in the cy∣te
of vyenne  wenyng to hym that hys sone parys had not ben there was ful
sory & had gr••te dysplaysyr of it and sayd  Fayr sone Parys I am in a grete
ma∣lencolye & in a thought for you that ye be not so Ioyeful ne me∣ry as
ye were wonte to be  here afore tyme I sawe you euer re∣dy to the
Ioustes and to al ma∣ner faytes of chyualrye for to gete honour  & I
now see you al chaunged syn ye took ac∣queyntaunce wyth thys bysshop for
lothe I were to see you by∣come a man of relygyon as I fere he wyl
brynge you to  and ryght wrothe I am that ye were not at that noble and
ryal tour¦noyment that hath be holden in vyenne for the sake of alle the
ladyes of thys londe  wherfore dere sone I praye you to take hede to
your self that ye lese not your good renommee  your wor¦shyp ne the
praysyng also that ye gate afore tyme  and that ye spende not your
yongthe in yo••e¦nesse  And Parys heryng alle thys ansuerd noo thyng to hys fader but
abode stylle pensyf••••ll thynkyng on y^e beaute of vyēne 

NOw sayth thystorye that as ye haue herde aboue a grete stryf befyl
emong the knyghtes aforesayd for the loue of the thre damoyse••les a∣fore sayd  For the erles sone of Flaundres was gretely wrothe for
thys cause wyth the Duc of brennes and had beten & hurte sore eche other
so that none myʒt make the pees betwyxte theym  For eyther of hem
mayntened & bare oute the beaute of his lady It happed thenne that fyue
knyghtes hardy and valyaunte came forth the whyche sayd that they were
redy to fyght and for to proue by force of armes that Florye the dukes
doughter of Normandye was the fayrest da∣moysel of alle the world  And
Incontynent stert vp fyue other knyghtes that said & mayntened


      

that cou••taunce the kynges sys∣ter of englond was the fayrest  And forthwyth
other v knygh¦tes rose vp that mayntened and vphelde the beaute of
vyenne a∣boue alle other wymmen in the world in so moche that thys
de∣bute cam to the knowleche of the kyng of Fraunce whiche sayd that
herof myght growe a grete trouble and dyscorde emong his barons & other
lordes  Soo sente he worde to them that they shold come toward hym and
that he shold gyue suche a sentence vpon theyr stryf that they al shold
be therof contente  the whyche mes¦sage p••••sed them wel and came 〈◊〉〈◊〉 toward hym assone as they myght  And whan they were come tofore the
kyng they spake of theyr stryf  But anone the kyng ordeyned a Ioustes
for the lou•• of the sayd thre ladyes  & made his m••undement that they al shold co••e wyth theyr ar∣mes and hors for to Iouste the viij day of septembre in
the cyte of parys  and they that shold do best in armes at that day
they shold haue the prys & the wor∣shyp of the feste and the lady on
whos beaute they helde with shold be reputed and holden for the fayrest
damoysel of alle the world  The kyng of Fraunce thenne sente worde to
the faders of the forsayd thre ladyes pray¦eng them to come atte same
feste and that eyther of them shold brynge wyth hym a present of
rychesse the which thre presentes shold be yeuen in the worshyp of their
thre doughters to the best doer in armes in token of vycto¦rye  And
thus the kyng of en∣glond fyrst sent for hys syster Constau••ce a fayre crowne of gold alle sette wyth perlys and precyous stones of
grete value  The duc of Normandye for loue of hys doughter Florye sente
a ryght fayre garlond sette wyth dyuers perlys & precyous sto∣nes moche
ryche and of grete extymacyon  And the daulphyn for loue of hys
doughter vyenne sente a moche ryche coler of gold al enuyronned wyth
precyous stones of, dyuers colours  the whiche was worth a ryght grete
tresour  And these thre Iewel∣lys were delyuerd to the kynge of
Fraunce  The forsayd knygh¦tes thenne made them redy and apparaylled al
thynges accor∣dyng to the Ioustes  & in ryche araye came al to the cyte
of Pa¦rys  and wete ye wel that in Fraunce was not seen afore that day
so grete noblesse of barons and knyghtes as were there as¦sembled  for
there were the moost hye prynces & barons of englond of Fraunce and of
Normandye and eyther of them dyd sette al hys wytte and en••endement to vpholde and bere oute that they


      

had purposed and sayd  and euery baron gaf hys lyuerey that they shold
be knowen eche fro other  & the bruyt & renōme was that my lady
constaunce shold haue thonour of that feste for thys that many a fayre
and hardy knyght made them redy to mayntene the quarelle of hyr
beaulte  but neuertheles eyther of these thre partyes hoped to haue the
worshyp of the feste  & parys that was in vyenne the cyte  and that
wel knewe the grete apparaylle of thys feste  took counceyl of Edward
hys felawe whether he shold goo to parys or not  And Edward counceylled
hym to goo thyder  so that he wente secretly  & sayd yf ye goo thyder
secretly and yf god gyue you grace that ye gete the worshyp of the
feste  grete wele & good shal come to you therby  and yf ye goo and be
knowen the. daulphyn and the other lordes shal not preyse you soo moche
as they shold yf ye were vnknowen for cause that ye be not of so grete
lygnage as they be  another is yf ye goo o∣penl̄y and that my lady
vyenne happeth to haue thonour of the feste by your prowesse  she shal
nought be sette by  consyderyng the other grete lordes that shal be
there procedyng your degree  & yf she gete the worshyp of the feste by
a knyght vnknowen the loue and honour shal growe the more in hyr courage
toward hym that thus hath doon for hyr sake  wherfore I counceyl you to
goo thyder in the moost secretest wyse that ye may  for my truste is
that ye shal gete grete wor∣shyp there  and but yf ye goo  truste me I
shal make my self redy to goo thyder for you  For I wyl be lothe to s••e the beaulte of my lady vyēne to be rebuked At these wordes graunted
Pa∣rys to goo to the sayd Ioustes  and whan he was redy & ha•••• al thynges accordyng to a no∣ble knyght he departed in the se∣cretest
manere that he myght to∣ward the cyte of parys wh••re as the kyng of Fraunce maad grete prouysyon of alle maner metes and
of al other thynges necessarye to suche a ryal fe••te  And in the myddes of the cyte of parys he ordeyned the place where
the knyghtes shold Iouste and dyd doo make many fayre scaffoldes for the
ladyes and da¦moyselles to be sette on  for to be holde the Ioustyng 
Also he dyd do make thre baners ful fayre and ryche  the fyrst baner
was whyt  and there was wryton vpon hit in letters of gold  vy∣enne
doughter to my lord god∣froy of alenson daulphyn of vy¦ennoys  the
second baner was rede  and was wryton theron in letters of gold 
Constaunce the


      

kynges syster of englond  The thyrd baner was whyt and in letters of
gold was wryton the∣ron  Florye doughter to the duc o•• nor••andye  and these iij ba∣ners were pyght vp at the thre cornes of the
felde  and wete ye that so grete prees was there that the peple took
theyr place vpon the scaffoldes ij dayes afore the feste for to see the
grete peple & the fayr ordynaunce that there was 

WHan it was so that the lordes were redy of alle ••hynges that were ne∣cessarye  and were departed fro theyr contrees they
assembled al at parys the xiiij day of septem¦bre  and neuer tofore was
seen so grete a companye of nobles  For fro alle partyes was comen
grete chyualrye  the sōme for to do armes  and the other for to see
the feste whyche was moche sumptuous and noble  & whan the day assygned

merueillously for the nombre of perles & precyous stones that were in
the baners  Now it shold be ouerlonge to recyte of the barons and of
the knyghtes that were in that Iour¦neye  For many were comen thy¦der
fro the royame of spayne  of aragon and of many other con¦trees for to
proue their strengthe and persones  and for to mayn¦tene the barons that m••yntened the thre ladyes maydens  Of whome we shall reherce of the

shal haue the prys and thonour of them of Englond of Fraunce & of
Normandye  and that to thys noo man be so hardy to gaynsay vpon the
payne to lose his lyf 


      

And yet after thys he sayd  ye see here a fayre crowne the why∣che the
quene of Fraunce hath or¦deyned  to thende that it be dely∣uerd to the
fader of the damoy∣sel that shal haue the prys and honour of the felde

mustre was made  euery baner retorned in to hys place  whyche moche
noble and meruayllous thynge was it to see and to by∣holde the noblesse

        How Parys wan the prys at the Ioustes in the cyte of Parys 

WHan thenne it came to the houre of tyerce began the Ioustes  and cam

And thēne came the free knyght parys a∣yenst geffroy beryng lowe hys

parys wyth a grete desyre consented  and soo bothe retorned & came
rennyng  And Parys gaf to geffroy so grete a stroke  that hys hors
slode and thenne geffroy ouerthrewe to the erthe  but by cause that the
hors slode it was sayd that the hors was cause that he ouerthrewe  For
moche they mayntened gef∣froy and sayd that he was not vaynquysshed  &
that it shold be wel doon that they shold Iuste ageyn  And by cause
that Pa∣rys was not knowen ther was none that mayntened hym ne
susteyned  neuertheles the kyng of fraunce knewe wel that gef∣froy was
vaynquysshed loyally & wel  For he had wel seen the aduenture  & wold

and anone sente to hym an heraulde whyche sayd to hym in the name of the
kynge of fraunce  that the kyng had wel seen & wel knewe that Parys had
vaynquysshed hys knyght  Notwythstondyng yf he wold yet ones retorne to

thenne Parys maad hys ansuer sayeng that the beaulte of my lady vyēne
was so grete that in al the world was none to hyr lyke  that yf it
pleased the Kyng I am redy for to


      

furnysshe the Ioustes for hys loue ayenst the knyght yet ano∣ther tyme 
and to Iuste tyl that geffroy shold be vaynquysshed  & that was
wythoute ony gayn sayeng  & the heraulde retorned and tolde it to the
kyng  whe∣rof the kyng was wel contente & sayd that the knyght ought to

retorned to the Iustes  & smote to gyder wyth soo grete myght  that by
veray force geffroy went to therthe vnder hys hors ryght euyl hurte 

THenne whan it came to∣ward euen the Ioustes were so grete thycke and

doun to the erthe  that there abode no moo of the partye of vyenne but

the felde 


        How the kyng commaunded that the thre baners wyth the in

THe Ioustes fynysshed Parys wanne the beau∣te of hys lady the fayre
vyenne  and he was ledde to the scaffolde where as the kynge was  &
the other grete lordes & knyghtes & there were delyuerd to hym the thre
baners & the thre Iewellys that were in them  & Parys shewed them
thurgh all the felde  in sygne that the sayd vyenne had goten thonour
for to be the fayrest damoysell that was in alle the world by the same
yonge knyght  and whan Parys had the thre fayr baners and the thre
ryche Iewellys  he


      

and Edward hys felowe de∣parted out of the cyte of parys and oute of
fraunce the moost secrete wyse that they myght  & retorned in to
dalphyne  Parys retorned in to the companye of the forsayd bysshop of
Saynt Laurence  as he had not been at the feste  & alwaye he
demaun∣ded tydynges of the Iustes that were made in fraunce  and who
had thonour of the Ioustes 

WHan the feste was made al the barons & knygh∣tes that were there had 〈◊〉〈◊〉 desyre to knowe who was 〈◊〉〈◊〉 that so valyauntly & so nobly 〈◊〉〈◊〉 wonne the Iourneye & the honour of the Iustes for to doo to hym
worshyp  but they coude neuer knowe hym  wherof they had grete
dysplaysyr  & sayd that the knyght was of grete wysedom  by cause he
wold not be knowen  And after this the barons & knyghtes took leue of
the kyng  and retorned in to theyr londes al dyscomforted  by cause
they had not goten the ho¦nour of the feste  and yet were they more
angry by cause they knewe not to whome the honour was gyuen of the feste
ne of the Iustes  The kyng of Fraunce whyche moche loued the dolphyn
made to hym grete feste & moche grete honour  And the kyng de¦lyuerd to
hym the crowne that the quene had gyuen  for to gyue to hyr that shold
haue the honour of the Ioustes  to thende that he shold gyue it vnto
hys doughter vyenne in sygne & to∣ken that she was the moost fayr
damoysel of the world  & whan al thys was doon  the dolphyn and the
fader of parys retorned in to dolphyne in moche grete ho¦nour and gre••e Ioye  whan vy¦enne knewe that hyr fader came she came and mette hym
as she was accustomed  Thenne whan the dolphyn sawe hyr  he kyssed hyr
& sette on her hede the crowne whyche the kynge had gyuen hym  and
tolde to hyr how she had goton the honour for to be the moost fayrest
damoysell of the world  and loo here is the fayr crowne that the quene
of fraunce sendeth to you in token that ye haue goten the honour  Not
wythstondyng fayr dough∣ter  that ye haue had many con¦trarye therto 
but ye haue had a good deffendour & ryʒt stronge and hath wel quyted hym
in your nede  For of eche partye were abyden thre knyghtes mo∣che
stronge and p••yssaunte  and on your partye was left but one knyght onely whyche
vaynquys¦shed al the other  wythout ony token  and is departed alle
se∣cretly that no man knewe hym ne the kyng of fraunce hath no knowleche
of hym  but he hath


      

borne awaye wyth hym the thre baners & the iij Iewellys that were in
them & also the prys & thonour of the feste  wherfore swete & fayr
doughter ye wote neuer to whom to gyue thankyn¦ges of so moche honour as
hath be doon for you  but I praye to god of heuen & to the glorious
vyrgyn marye  that it playse hym to gyue to hym good & ho∣nour  Ioye &
excellence & in alle his feates vyctorye  lyke as he is chyef & hede of
al honour and of al chyualrye in thys world For I neuer sawe ne herde of
knyght that so gracyously and so curtoysly bare hym in his ar∣mes & in
his chyualryes  And whan vyēne herde sp••ke of these tydynges  & sawe the grete ho∣nour & prys that she had
goten and al was comen by this noble knyght  she sayd to ysabeau hyr
damoysel  My suster sayd I not to you wel but late  that I was byloued
by the moost noble and valyaunt knyght of fraunce  & and by my fayth my
swete sus∣ter  this is he y^t so swetely songe & that wanne the Iustes
in this cyte & bare with hym the shelde of crystal & my garlonde  and
went his waye so that noo man myght knowe hym  aduyse you wel fayr
suster what hanour is comen to me by his prowesse & by his bounte  I
may wel be so∣ry & dolant  whan I may not knowe who he is  & myn herte
is moche heuy & myn entend••∣ment that I neuer can fynde the moyen to see & knowe hym  and yet she
sayd  Certes my swete suster ysabeau  I byleue that my dayes be
shorte  & that I shall deye of somme cruel & fals deth for the grete
desplaysyr that I haue contynuelly in my herte  for I can none other
thynge doo but wepe & waylle  & alwaye to contynue in sorouful lyf &
heuy but none apperceyued it but o∣nely hyr damoysel ysabeau 

THe fader of parys why∣che had ben with the dol∣phyn in that feste had
not seen there hys sone Parys  wherof he had grete sorowe in his
herte  for he had seen that he was accustomed to be in al noble
Ius¦tes  but thenne he sawe hym goo with the bysshop of saynt
Lau∣rence  and dysposed hym not to doo armes as he was woned  wherfor
he sayd to hym on a day My sone I had hoped to haue had in the grete
consolacyo••  but now thou byngest me in to grete heuynesse and dysplay∣syr  whan
I see that thou wylt not departe from thys bysshop wherfor I praye the
that y^u leue hym  & doo soo that it may be to me playsaunt and to the
hon∣neste  Parys herde hym wel  but he gaf not a word to ansuer


      

The fader of Parys seyng thys went to his secrete felowe Ed∣ward and
sayd to hym  I see wel that the grete amytye & loue that ye haue to my
sone  and knowe ye for certayn that I haue in my hert grete melancolye
whan I remembre that Parys hath had grete honour & fame of chyualrye 
and now I see that he gooth al wyth thys bys∣shop  and leteth hys
hawkes  his houndes and hors to deye for hongre  wherfore I praye you
that ye wyl gyue me somme counceyl  whyche am soo mes∣chaunt that I
deye for sorowe  And whan he had sayd these wordes  Edward had pyte of
hym  & comforted hym the beste wy••e he coude  and departed fro hym  and wente strayte to hys felowe
Parys and sayd to hym I knowe wel that loue constray¦neth the so
strongely  that thou hast noo power ouer thy self  wherfore thy lyf
may not longe endure  And also thy fader and thy frendes ben euyl
contente a∣yenst the  and I say to the that for to be vertuous and
valyaunt it playseth moche to god  And for the loue of one woman thou
doost moche desplaysyr to thy fa∣der  And also for noo persone what
someuer he or she be  thou oughtest not to lese the wele & renomee that
thou hast of chy∣ualrye  It appyereth not in the  that thou hast ouy
vertue or cou∣rage  wherfore I praye the that thou wylt do somme thyng
that it may be playsaunt to thy fader whych hath desyred & prayed me
that I shold soo say to the  whan parys had herde al this  he an∣suerd
to edward and sayd to hym  I knowe wel that these thynges that thou
hast sayd to me been vertuous & honnest  but they been to me greuous 
for to put me from the thoughtes in whyche I am contynuelly 
Ne∣uertheles I praye the that thou gyue me counceyl what is beste that I
doo  Thenne sayd edward it shold wel playse me  yf it were thy playsyr
that we shold goo in to braband  For it is vj monethes passed that I
haue not seen my lady  & there shall we do armes  by which we may gete
fame and honour  & paris agreed therto sayeng that he was contente yf
it playsed hym so to do  & Incontynent they made redy theyr harnoys &
horses and alle thynges necessarye to them  & or Parys departed he put
in hys chambre al the thynges & pryses that he had wōne by chyualryes &
closed them fast in his chābre  & delyuerd the keye to his moder &
prayed hir moche derly that she shold not open it  ne suffre y^t ony
persone shold entre therin  And after they wente toward Bra∣band 
where as they dyd grete


      

feates of chyualrye & Ioustes wherof they gate grete honoure and
worshyp  and were moche praysed of ladyes and damoy∣sellys  And parys
made coun¦tenaunce for to haue abyden in braband for the loue of edward
but hys herte drewe vnto the fayre Vyenne  whome he so mo∣che loued in
hys herte secretely 


        How Dyane and vyenne hyr doughter wenten to vysyte the fader of
        Parys the whyche was seek 

NOw it happened that du¦ryng thys tyme that Pa¦rys and Edward duel leden
in Braband  the fader of Parys fyl in to a sekenesse of foures or
accesse  And the cause came of the thought that he had of ••ys sone Parys  And he be¦yng seek the doulphyn wente on a day to see
hym  and de∣maunded the cause of hys mala¦dye  and comforted hym the
best wyse that he coude  and after re∣torned home  and sayd to hys
wyf  that it were wel doon that she shold goo see and vysyte messyre
Iaques whyche was seke  And forthwyth Inconty∣nent my lady dyane  hyr
dough∣ter Vyenne and ysabeau hyr da¦moysel wyth a grete companye wente
to the castel of Syr Ia∣ques  and salewed hym moche nobly as it wel
apperteyned  & the best wyse that they myght And whan they were in the
chambre where messyre Iaques was and laye  Dame dyane demaunded hym of
his sekenesse And messire Iaques sayd that al hys dys••ase came for hys sone Parys  by cause he loste so hys tyme  and that
he went alway wyth the bysshop of Saynt lau¦rence  wherof I fere me
that he shal become a man of relygyon  I haue no moo chyldren but hym 
I wote not what I shall doo wyth the goodes that god hath gyuen to me 
And my la∣dy dyane comforted hym and sayd that hys sone was moche wel
byloued of the doulphyn  & that he had moche grete amytye of many grete
lordes  barons & knyghtes  & also she sayd that emong al thynges he
shold or∣deyne for hys helthe  & after all thys the moder of parys
prayed hyr that it myght playse hyr to come see the castel  and she
an∣suerd that she moche desyred it Thenne the moder of parys she∣wed hir
al the castel  & ledde hir in to an halle al ful of armes and abylemens
of warre for to fyght in batayll  After she ladde hyr in to anothrr
halle where as were many hawkes  faul∣cens  and many other fowles of
chace  And after in to many


      

other halles & chambres rychely arayed whyche were ouer longe to
reherce  And after the moder of Parys shewed vnto hyr the chambre of
Parys where that he slepte  wherin were many abyl∣ments  whyche shold
wel suf∣fyse y^e chambre of a grete prynce And in the sayd chambre were
two grete standardes couerd af∣ter the guyse of Fraunce  That one was
ful of clo••he of gold and sylke  and that other of harnoys and of many other
thyn¦ges  Thenne sayd Vyenne to y••abeau  by my fayth fayr sys∣ter I haue noo grete meruaylle of th••s yonge knyght Parys though of hym be maad grete m••ncyon  For thordynaunce of thyse thynges shewe wel that he is of grete
valure  And in by∣holdyng of these thynges she sawe a couerture of an
hors alle whyte  And hyr semed that it was the same that the knyght b••re that wanne the prys of the Ioustes that was made in the cyte of
Vyenne  and that had the shelde of crystal & the gar∣lond whych she
tolde to ysabeau And ysabeau ansuerd to hyr  neuer thynke ye soo  For
all day been made semalable couertures and tokenes whyte  wherof ye may
wel be deceyued  Vyenne enforced alle waye hyr self to t••ke better hede  and of the grete Ioye that she had she sayd to hyr
moder  Madame I am a lytel crased and sodeynly taken  wher¦fore yf it
playse you I wold fayne reste a lytel in this cham¦bre  and late me be
alle allone wyth my suster ysabeau  for I wyl haue none other  and
a∣none eche body auoyded oute of the chambre  and ysabeau dyd shytte
the dore that none myght come in  Thenne sayd vyenne now we shal see
yf we may fynde ony thynge that we may haue better knowleche of  For
myn herte sayth yes  After that they had serched and vy∣syted alle the
chambre  they cam on a syde of the chambre where they fonde a lytel
dore  of why∣che henge a lytel keye by a thwonge  and anone they
ope∣ned the dore and entred therin And there was a lytel cham∣bre whyche
was xij foot longe  and was an oratorye  where as was the mageste of
our Lord Ihesu Cryst vpon a lytel aulter and at eche corner was a
can∣styke of syluer  and thyder cam Parys for to make hys sacre∣fyse
whan he aroos  and whan he wente to hys bedde 

And there were the thre ba∣ners that the noble knyght Pa∣rys had wonne
in the cyte of Parys  And the thre Iewel∣lys of the thre damoyselles
afore sayd  And in the same place was also the shelde of Crystal


      

and the garlond that Vyenne delyuerd to hym whan he wāne the prys at the
Ioustes in the cyte of vyenne  And all these he kepte secrete in that
place  And whan vyenne sawe these thyn∣ges  she was sure that Parys
was he whome she had so moche desyred to knowe  and that soo moche
honour had doon to hyr  and for the grete Ioye that she had  she sette
hyr doun on the grounde  and there abode a grete whyle  and coude not
speke a word  And after she spake to ysabeau  & sayd my swete
sys∣ter  blessyd and preysed be our lord of thys good Iourney  For me
thynketh I shold neuer de∣parte oute of thys chambre  Alas I haue so
longe abyden to knowe  who he was that so swe¦tely played in his
Instrumen∣tes so nygh vnto me  and now he is so ferre  & thenne
ysabeau began to repreue hyr and sayd to hyr  Swete lady I praye you
that ye say ne do ony thyng whi∣che myght torne you to folye  and be ye
ruled by wysedom and reason  For not wythstondyng that parys haue so
moche good & vertues  yet ye ought to consy¦der that he is not ••gal to you in lygnage ne in estate  For I knowe wel that many noble &
puyssaunt lordes haue demaun∣ded you in maryage  & loue you & do grete
thynges for you  and also thonour of Parys whyche is your vayssal and
subget is not egall ne worthy vnto you  Thenne vyenne was moche angry
on ysabeau and began to say  A veray god I am wel dyscomforted and
deceyued by the  that thus agayn sayest me of hym that I so longe haue
desyred to knowe  Alas I had supposed that in noo thyng ye wold haue
dysplaysed me  And in good fayth I say to the  that this man I wyl
loue and demaunde  and I promyse the in good fayth  that yf thou ony
more gaynsaye me I shal slee my self  and thenne thou shalt be caus•• of my deth  For I wyl not lese hym that I haue so longe loued  but I
say to the for trouthe  that yf thou euer say to me suche wordes of my
frende parys  that thou shalt neuer after haue space to say them ageyn
another tyme  for yf thou consyderest wel hys noble con∣dycyons and
custommes  thou sholdest preyse hym better than thou doost  And
knowest thou not wel that the kyng of fraūce wold that it had coste hym
half hys Royame that hys sone Lo∣wys were as valyaunte as pa∣rys is 
And also there be many notable lordes that desyre to knowe his nam••  and to haue hys amytye 

Thenne take hede and byholde by my fayth yf euer thou sawe


      

man that myght be compared to hym  certaynly alle vertues been in hym 
And sythe that fortune hath brought me to hys loue  he is worthy to
haue my loue  and yet more than is in me  And haue I not reason &
cause thēne to loue hym  whyche hath doon to me so grete good and
honour and doubtyng noo peryl of hys persone  and is it not wel grete
worshyp to my fader to haue for vaissal and subget the beste knyght that
is in all the world For in alle the world is noo knyght that I wold
forsake pa¦rys fore  ne oone that hath doon so moche for me  And thus
to speke of the feates of Parys she doude not stynte 

Thenne came two  damoysel∣les knockyng at the chambre dore sayeng 
Vyenne ye must come to my lady  And ysabeau sprange oute sayeng that
she shold come anone  And vyēne seyng that she must nedes departe fro
thens sayd to ysabeau  My suster syth we must departe hens late vs take
somme of these Ie∣wellys  and we shal kepe them secretly tyl that Ptrys
be comen and we shal see what counte∣naunce he shal make in hym self
Thenne they took the colyer and the whyte baner of vyenne and other
Iewellys and hydde them vnder theyr clothes  and wente in to the
chambre of mes∣syre Iaques  but vyenne desy∣red gretely to speke with pari•• and thought longe or he came home  And in the mene whyle messire
Iaques recouerd of his maladye and bycam alle hool wherof Vyenne had
grete Ioye but she durst not shewe it 


        How Parys and Edward retorned oute of braband 

AFter certeyn tyme that Parys had be in Bra∣band wyth hys felowe
Edward  he desyred strongely to see the fayr vyenne  For the loue of
hyr destrayned hym mo∣che strongly  Neuertheles he durst not telle it
to hys felowe  to thende that he shold take noo dysplaysyr of hys
departyng  And sone after the space of v dayes Parys receyued a letter
that hys fader was seek  & thēne he sayd to Edward  Ryght dere brother

Incontynente they departed oute of braband


      

and came in to the cyte of vy∣enne  of whos comyng messyr Iaques had
souerayn playsyr specyally  by cause he had herde that Parys hys sone
had doon valyauntly feates of armes  Now it happed that whan Parys was
arryued at home wyth hys fader lyke as he was accustomed  Allewaye
tofore or he wente to hys ••edde  he wente to make hys orysons and pray¦ers  and after he aduysed
yf he lacked ony thynge  and fonde that tho thynges that he loued beste
were taken awaye  wherof he was moche angry  and quasi half in despayr
in suche wyse that alle the nyght he coude not slepe And whan it came i•• the mor∣nyng he came to hys moder and sayd  Moder how is it that ye
haue not kepte my chābre cloos and shytte  For I lacke cer∣tayn thynges
whyche I wold not gladly lese  and haue for them grete dysplaysir  To
whom hys moder ansuerd  My sone by my fayth there neuer entred therin
persone  but on a tyme whan your fader was seek came my lady dyane and
hyr dough∣ter vyenne  and whan they had vysyted your fader  they wente
al aboute for to see thys castel  and thenne they entred in to your

not longe  sauf onely vyenne whyche taryed o∣nely allone sauf hyr
damoysel  by cause she was euyl at ease at hyr hert  wherfore my sone
I praye you to take noo dysplay∣syr  And thenne Parys sayd to hym
self  yf none other theef haue taken it sauf she I shal not be
dyscouerd  Neuertheles I wote neuer yf Vyenne hath taken it awaye for

& wente to do the reuerence to the daulphyn  and to dame Dyane  And
after to Vyenne theyr doughter  And the dol∣phyn receyued hym moche
cur∣toysly  And the daulphyn demaunded hym tydynges and of many other
thynges  And whan the fayre lady Vyenne sawe parys of the grete desyre
that she had to see hym  and of the grete loue that she bare to hym 
alle hyr ch••re was coloured lyke a fresshe rose in the monthe of Maye  and coude
not be contente ne fylled to be∣holde hyr fayre loue and frende Parys 
And the more she by∣helde hym  the more grewe and encreaced hyr loue
toward hym And Parys beyng tofore the dolphyn on his knee moche hum¦bly
durst not boke on Vyenne  But in hys herte he had grete payne  And who
had wel by holden hym  had wel seen in his


      

vysage hys thought  And after that the dolphyn had demaun∣ded hym of
that it plased hym Parys took leue of the dolphyn and of my lady dyane &
of vy∣enne theyr doughter & retorned home to hys faders hous 

AFter a fewe dayes Vy∣enne in suche wyse as loue destrayned hyr said to

than tofore  and took terme to see eche other ageyn as hastely as they
myght  and vyenne re∣torned more Ioyously than she shewed  and wente
in to hyr moders chambre  and after the bysshop departed  & parys

parlament that he had had wyth vyenne  & Edward sayd to hym  fayre
brother and frende  herein is no Iape ne truffes  but I praye you that
ye do your thynges secretly for there ben many false tonges And Vyenne
was moche more Ioyous than she had ben accusto¦med  and Parys also 
And the sayd Parys & edward hys felowe made grete chyualryes & dyd grete
armes  whyche were moche playsaunt to the fayre vy¦enne  Thenne it
happed that af∣ter certeyn tyme seyng the dol∣phyn that hys doughter was
come to xv yere of age  treated for to gyue to hyr an husbond  And
many tymes he had ben re¦quyred of many noble prynces but by cause he
had but hyr one∣ly and no moo sones ne dough¦ters  vnnethe he wold
consente And in treatyng thus of mary¦age Parys herde somme thynges
wherof he was sore ennoyed in hym self  and thought  why thynke not I
to haue this noble lady whyche is so moche desy∣red of so many noble
prynces & barons  and sore bewaylled hym self  and dyd soo moche that
he spake to vyenne and sayd  O swete Vyenne  where is your fayr and
agreable promesse that ye made to me whan I departed fro you  and how
may it be  that your fader speketh for to marye you 

WHan vyenne herde Pa∣rys speke in thys ma∣nere  she sayd to hym pa¦rys
yf my fader speke to me of maryage  it is noo grete mer∣uaylle  for I
may not deffende hym  Neuertheles I haue not consented to ony maryage 
And ye knowe wel that maryage is


      

nothyng worth  wythout the con¦sentyng of bothe partyes  wher∣fore I
praye you to be contente  for I promyse to you that I shal neuer haue
man in mariage but you  and I wold that it shold be shortly
accomplysshed yf it pleased god  honestly & Iustly and not in synne ne
in ordure  Therfore I wyl that ye assaye one thynge  which shal be
moche dyffycyle to doo and ryght pe∣ryllous  but neuertheles it byho¦••eth that it be doon  thēne sayd Parys  honourable lady  that whyche
shal playse you to com∣maunde me  I shal accomplisshe it with good hert
though I shold deye  & thanne sayd Vyenne  I wyl that Incontynent ye
say to your fader  that he goo to my lord my fader  and requyre hym
that he gyue me in maryage to you  and that herein ther be no
deffaute  & whan Parys herde the wylle & desyre of vyenne  he was
quasi al abasshed & sayd  Ryght honourable lady & how  wyl ye that I
deye thus  I praye you yf it playse you  that it be not doo  Thenne
vyēne sayd sette ye so lytel by me  that ye wyl not enterpryse this 
Alas where is your entendement  Certes it must nedes be doon 
Incontynent Parys ansuerd  worshypfull lady  sythe it playseth you  I
shal accomplysshe your cōman∣dement though I shold deye ther∣fore an
hondred thousand tymes & thus took leue of vyenne and wente to hys fader
Incontynent and sayd to hym  Dere fader alwaye ye haue shewed to me
grete loue  wherfore I byseche al myʒty god that he rewarde you lyke as
I desyre  Dere & honou¦rable fader I wold praye you of one thynge  and
by cause it is doubtous I wyl that ye promyse it to me tofore I say it
to you  for ellys I wyl not say it vnto you  & hys fader sayd to hym 
My sone there is nothyng in the world that I may doo for the  but I
shal accomplysshe it by the grace of god  therfor say to me thy playsyr
& wylle  & thenne parys tolde to hys fader a parte of the pryuete and
promesse that he had wyth vyenne  by cause he shold wyth the letter
wylle doo that  whyche he wold requyre hym  Thenne sayd parys to his
fader  the prayer that I praye & requyre you is  that it playse you to
say to the dolphyn  that he gyue to me hys doughter to wyf and in
maryage  And I humbly byseche you that herein ye wyl not faylle me  &
messire Iaques heryng hys sone thus speke  almoost he was fro hym self
for the grete folye y^t he sayd to hym  & he sayd in repreuyng hym that
he neuer shold speke more of that fayte  for he wold not deye for hys
doughter  and


      

that he shold demaunde of hym somme other thynge  for it were grete
folye to speke to hym of suche a thynge  And parys sayd worshypful
fader  as moche pe∣ryllous is it to me as to you  therfor I am not
abasshed thugh ye reffused to doo it  But loue enforceth and
constreyneth me so strongely  that I am half con¦fused  and am as wel
contente that he do it not  as to doo it  but that ye do your deuoyr
one∣ly  and so longe parys prayed hys fader  that be promysed hym to
doo it 


        How messire Iaques demaū¦ded of the doulphyn hys dough¦ter
        vyenne in maryage for hys sone Parys 

THenne went messire Ia¦ques to the dolphyn all chaunged of colour and
sayd to hym  My ryght redoub∣ted and souerayn lord a certeyn requeste
is made to me  whyche I must say vnto you  the whiche me semeth is of
passyng lytel reason  and therfore it must be at your mercy  and in
caas ye fynde therin dysplaysyr  that ye pardonne me  and to take noo
regarde to my grete folye  The doulphyn trustyng in the grete wysedom
of messire Iaques graū¦ted hym to say what someuer he wold  Thenne sayd
messire Ia∣ques  Myn hye and souerayn lord  Parys my sone hath pray¦ed
me so moche that I shold re∣quyre of you vyenne your dou∣ghter to be hys
wyf  the whiche thynge is not onely to say  but also to thynke grete
presumpsy∣on and grete folye  but the loue of my sone constrayneth me
soo strongely  that by force I must say it to you  And sodeynly the
doulphyn was moeued in grete felonnye  and wold not suffre hym to ende
hys wordes  but re¦preued hym moche hardly say∣eng  vylayne & vassal
that thou arte  how kepest thou my wor∣shyp  by god I shal wel
chastyse you  that ye shal neuer thynke suche thynges  and comaunded
hym that Incontynent he shold departe thens  and that neuer be¦ne hys
sone shold come in hys syght  wherfore messire Iaques departed thens
moche rebuked holdyng doun hys heed  and re¦torned in to hys hous  &
tolde to hys sone Parys al that had be sayd and doon bytwene hym & the
Doulphyn  wherof Parys thanked moche hys fader 

THe doulphyn wente in grete thouʒt thurgh the paleys hauyng grete
In¦dygnacyon and alle angry in soo moche that none durst speke to hym ne
come in his waye  and he beyng thus in thys manere


      

he sente for his doughter vyēne & made hyr to come to hym  and sayd to
hyr  we haue had wor∣des of grete dysplaysyr  Thys vyllayne messyre
Iaques hath sayd to vs that we shold gyue you to wyf and in maryage to
hys sone Parys  Aduyse you what wysedom it were  by god or that I
shold do it  I wold ra∣ther make you a nonne or a menchon  & it shal
not be longe to  but that ye shal be hyely ma∣ryed  so that ye shal
holde you conde••••e  & here I swere to you that yf it were not for the grete seruyces
that he hath doon to me Incontynent I shold do smyte of hys hede  &
whan vyenne sawe hyr fader in so grete angre ayenst messyre Iaques & hys
sone  she sente for to seche Edward for to come speke to hyr  & whan
Ed∣ward was come Vyenne sayd to hym  Edward it is soo that my fader is
moche angry ayenst messire Iaques & ayenst parys wherof I haue grete
dysplaysyr & haue grete doubte that my fa∣der wyl do somme harme to
Pa¦rys  & therfore I wyl that ye say to hym  that he kepe hym self in
the moost secretest wyse that he may  and I shal also see the manere yf
I may appease his felonnye and angre  Thenne ed∣ward Incontynent took
leue of vyenne  & went & sayd to paris all that vyenne had sayd to hym
& sayd fayr brother  me semeth that it were good that ye depar¦ted oute
of this contrey for to absente you for a space of tyme For it may be
that to the doul∣phyn shal longe endure hys an¦gre  as I vnderstonde by
that whyche vyenne hath sayd to me  Thenne ansuerd Parys  sythe that
ye haue counceylled me soo I shal so do  not wythstondyng that it shal
be to me a sorouful & an heuy departyng  but er I departe I shal take
leue of Vy∣enne though I shold deye 

THenne Parys dyd soo moche that he spake vnto vyenne on a derke nyght at
a lowe wyndowe  where as they myght wel say what they wold  I am
certeyn sayd vy∣enne that my fader hath wylle to hurte you  wherof I
lyue in grete melancolye  For in al the world is no thynge that I loue
so moche as you  & yf by aduen¦ture ye deye I wyl not lyue  Thenne
sayd parys  h••nourable lady it semeth me beste that I departe fro hens a certeyn tyme
tyl my lord your fader be more peased & hath passed hys euyll wylle 
how be it  that it shal be to me a moche sorouful thynge to wythdrawe
me fro you  For my lyf shal be moche heuy  Ne∣uertheles I shal ac••omplysshe your wylle in alle that ye shall


      

commaunde me  what someuer come therof  And vyēne seyng the good wylle
of parys after many wordes she sayd to hym  Parys my frende I knowe
well the grete loue that ye bere to me  & sythe it so is  I swere to
you by my fayth  that ye shal neuer departe fro thys cyte wythoute that
I goo wyth you  For it is my wylle  wherfore assone as ye may  make
you redy of al thyn∣ges necessarye  and  fynde ye the manere that we
may escape oute of the royame of fraunce  and that we may goo in to
somme other lordshyppe  where as we may lyue Ioyously and surely
Neuertheles tofore or we departe from hens I wyl that ••e promyse two thynges  The fyrst is  that ye touche not my body vnto
the tyme that we be lawfully mary¦ed  The second is that ysabeau parte
in al the goodes that we shal haue  and other thynge wyl I not as for
thys present tyme  but that onely our depar∣tyng may be shortely  and
I shal pourueye somme Iewels & money for our necessyte  and al thys
Parys promysed to hyr  and eche departed fro other for tadresse suche
thynges as to them shold be necessarye 

WHan Parys was depar¦ted fro vyenne he wente to a man named george and
sayd to hym  George my frende alwaye I haue trusted in you  and haue
alwaye loued you  wherfore I praye you now that to thys that I shal say
you ye faylle me not  for I promyse you ye shal not lese therby  and
George promysed to hym to doo al that shal be to hym possyble wyth ryght••good hert  & thenne Parys sayd to hym  knowe ye for cartayn that I
haue wrath & rancour to a man of thys to••••ne for certayn desplaysyr that he hath doon to me  wherfor I wyl slee
hym  and Incontynent as I haue slayne hym  I wyl departe out of the
royame of Fraunce  wherfore I praye you y^t ye wyl goo to Aygues
mortes  & that ye there make redy a galeye fur¦nysshed of al thynges
necessarye tyl that we be arryued there as we wold be  And also I praye
you that ye doo ordeyne fro hens to aygues mortes fro v myle to v myle
alwaye good horses re¦dy to thende that we may surely refresshe vs yf it
be nede  & also I wyl that ye do thys as secretly as ye may  and loo
here is mo¦ney ynough for to furnysshe these sayd thynges  George
sayd  I shal doo al thys gladly  And Incontynent made hym redy  &
whan he came to aygues mortes he hyred a galeye  and establis∣shed al
the passages  and dyd wel al that parys had charged


      

hym  & came ageyn  and tolde to parys how he had pourueyed al that he
had charged hym  whe¦rof parys was moche Ioyous  & anone parys wente
and tolde to Vyenne that alle thynges that she had comaunded were doon
And thēne they concluded that the nexte nyght folowyng that at a certeyn
houre eche of them shold be redy  thēne he took leue of hyr and wente
home  and bad George to take two hors out of hys stable  and that he
shold sa¦dle them and abyde hym wyth∣oute the cyte in a certayn place
tyl he shold come  & Edward the felowe of Parys wyste noo thynge of
alle thys  wherof he was moche abusshed and mer∣uayllously angry whan
that he knewe it 


        How parys ladde awaye vy∣enne and ysabeau by nyght 

WHan Parys was pour∣ueyed of money and of al other thynges beyng to them
necessarye  he wente al∣lone the secretest wyse y^t he myʒt and came to
the place emprysed at the houre taken  and he made a tokene whiche
vyenne knewe And anone vyenne and ysabeau cladde them in mannes araye & ••epen oute of y^e castel by a fauce porte  and so came these two
da∣moyselles to the place where as parys was allone  whyche a∣wayted
vpon theyr comyng  & Incontynent they departed and went where as theyr
horses were whom they took & rode as faste as they myght  and george
rode alwaye tofore by cause to knowe wel the waye  and whyles they thus
rode  aroos a storme wyth a grete rayne whyche endured tyl on the morne
at nyght  and thenne they arryued nygh vnto a lytel towne  but they entr••d not by cause they wold not be knowen  and wente & lodged them in a
lytel chyrche nygh vn∣to the toun  where they fonde a chapelayn whiche
receyued them gladly the best wyse he myght  & thenne whan the nyght
came Parys and the chapelayn slepte in a lytel hous Ioynyng to the
chyrche  George and parys ser∣uaunte slepten in the stable with the
bestes  And vyenne & ysa∣beau slepten in the chyrche  and in the
mornyng erly they wente lyghtly to horsback  & rode tyl they came nyghe
vnto a ryuer  whyche was rysen hye by cause of the rayne that had
fallen  Thenne parys was moche angry by cause he sawe wel that it was
moche peryllous  & sayd to Ge∣orge  that he shold serche & ad∣uyse
somme good place where they myght passe ouer  & george wythdrewe hym a
lytel from them  and chaas a place whiche


      

thought hym good  and took the ryuer wyth hys hors  And whan he was in
the myddes of the streme hys hors faylled hym that he was drowned and
hys hors also  Parys seyng that george was drowned was mo∣che sore
abasshed  and durst make noo semblaunte  by cause that fayre vyenne
shold haue noo me lancolye  And after Vyenne demaunded of Parys where
ge∣orge was bycomen  and parys answerd to hyr  that he had sent hym
for to serche somme good passage  and they wold torne in to the chyrche
ageyn tyl Ge∣orge were comen  And vyenne ansuerd to hym that it playsed
to hyr wel soo to doo  For she had grete doubte and fere for to passe
the water  And whan they were in the chyrche  Parys was moche aferde
to abyde longe in that place  for he sawe that it was  not sure 
wherfore he de∣maunded the chapelayn  yf they myght in ony wyse passe
that water  And the chapelayn sayd not in thre dayes tyl the water were
decre••ed and aualed  And parys sayd to hym that he shold goo in to the towne
to seche and see yf he myght fynde ony men that wold make a brydge soo
that they myʒt passe And that he shold spare for no money  For I shal
paye to them as moche as they wyl haue  & the chapelayn sayd that he
shold doo hys beste  Thus dyd Pa∣rys noo thynge but thynke how they
myght passe the ryuer  Now leue we Parys and torne we to the doulphyn 
whych had lost his fayre doughter vyenne 


        How the doulpyn dyd doo serche and seche vyenne by hys
        seruauntes 

ON the morne that vyēne was loste & departed fro the hous of hyr fader 
& that the doulphyn knewe it  he supposed to haue goon oute of hys
wytte  & al the courte was troubled  & sente hastely men on horsback &
a fote by dyuers par¦tyes the moost secretely that he myght  & prayed
them that they shold brynge home to hym vy∣enne quyck or dede  It
happed by aduēture that one of his men a fote that was sente to seche
Vyenne came in to the towne where as the chapelayn was co∣men to seche
men to make the brydge  The foteman demaun∣ded euery man yf they had
seen two damoyselles whyche were fledde fro the doulphyns courte  Thēne
the chapelayn said to hym that it was not longe syth suche tweyne
departed wyth other men And the man supposed that the sayd chapelayn
had sayd it


      

in Iape or in mockyng  And sayd that the Doulphyn was moche angry  and
had sworne that yf ony mā or woman kne∣we where they were and shewed it
not  that he shold make them to lose theyr hedes  And whan the
chapelayn herde these wordes he remembred hym of them that were hyd in
hys hous  And in grete drede sayd to hym  that he shold tarye there a
lytel  & that for the loue of my lord doul∣phyn he wold gladly seche
for them  and assone as he myght fynde tydynges of them he shold lete
hym wyte  And so departed fro thens  and retorned home ageyn  and
tolde al thys to pa¦rys  and what he had herde in the toune  sayeng
also that he doubted that it was for them of hys companye  wherfore he
sayd to hym ferthermore  syr I praye you that ye departe from hens 
and suffre not that I lese my lyf  but take ye the beste coun∣ceyl ye
can  For there ben fyfty men on horsback that seche you  whan Parys
herde hym say this it nedeth not to demaunde yf he were heuy and
melancolyous  and for the grete sorowe that he had he chaunged al his
colour  And he sayd to the chapelayn  I praye you that ye tarye a
ly∣tel & I shal make you an an∣suer  & thenne Parys went to vyenne 
for to telle to hir al thys feat  And whan vyenne sawe hym entre  and
so chaunged in hys colour sayd to paris  what tydynges brynge ye whyche
are so pale and your colour chaun∣ged  I praye you as hertely as I can
that it playse you to telle me  Thenne Parys sayd to hyr The tydynges
that I brynge ben euyl for you and for me  For shortly shal be
accomplisshed our aduenture  and therfore •• I wyl slee my self  and also he said com¦playnyng  O god how my lyf
is sorowful and heuy to haue brought thys excellent lady as ye ar in
suche daunger  O good god why gaf thou not to me the deth tofore or
that I fette hir out of hyr faders hous  O alas my fader and my moder
what shal be falle of you  whan the doul∣phyn shal knowe  that I haue
stolen from hym hys doughter  O my good felowe Edward why counceylled
not I wyth the tofore or I had doon thys folye And after he retorned to
vyēne sayeng  and what shal falle of you my lady  whan your fader shal
see you  Certes I thynke that how cruel that he be  whan he shal see
your noble persone  his hert shal not suffre to do you ony harme  O
god almyghty do to me that grace y^t I onely may bere the payn of this
fayt & none other  O lady vnhappy was that day for you and for me whan


      

fyrst ye had acqueyntaunce of me  And whan Parys had fynysshed hys
complaynte  he tolde to Vyenne al that the cha∣pelayn had sayd to hym 
And forthwyth as a persone despay∣red  took hys swerde and wold haue
ryuen it thurgh hys body  And Vyenne as vertuouse and valyaunte took to
hyr hert  and took the swerde fro hym and com¦forted hym and sayd  O
free knyght  my Ioye  my lyf  and my solace  what wyl ye doo  knowe
ye not wel  that who that sleeth hym self wytyngly  sleeth the soule
and the body  and yf ye deye  I assure you I shal deye also  and so
shal ye be cause of my deth as wel as of your owne O Parys where is your
wyse∣dom and your prowesse  Now whan ye shold haue moste stren∣gthe &
moost vertuous courage ye be aferde  O my knyght thys is noo newe
thynge that the per¦sones that lyuen in thys world haue trybulacyons 
of what so∣meuer lygnage they be  Certes thys is not the courage of one
so valyaunte knyght as ye be  For now whome that ye ought to comforte 
she must now com¦forte you  And therfor my fayr brother and frende I
praye you as moche as ye may  that Incon¦tynente ye departe fro hens 
and that ye goo your waye  and yf ye do not so I shal slee my self wyth
your swerde  For your de¦partyng is as greuons to me  as myn shal be
to you  but it by houeth to eschewe of two euyls the werse  And also
ye ought to consydere one thyng  that not wythstondyng the grete faulte
and trespaas that I haue made to my fader  yet therfore he shal not put
me to deth  consydered the grete loue that he hath a••way had toward me  and yf ye were taken  I wote wel that ye and I
shold bothe deye  And yet I haue good hope  that myn en∣tencyon shal
come vnto a good ende  For be ye sure though he neuer pardonne me  I
shal ne∣uer haue other husbond but you and that I promyse you by my
fayth  But alle waye of one thyng I praye you  that for none other
lady ye forgete not me  And whan ye shal be in ano∣ther contreye wryte
vnto me of your aduenture  And to thende that ye the better remembre me
loo here is a rynge of gold wyth a dyamonde  the which I praye you that
ye wyl kepe for the loue of me


        How Parys departed from Vyenne  and lefte hyr in the chyrche 

AFter moche other lan∣gage paris kyssed vyēne wyth grete syghes and


      

thoughtes  and she comforted hym the best wyse she myght  in prayeng
our lord Ihesu Cryste that in short tyme she myght see hym  lyke as hyr
herte desyred moost of ony thynge that was in the world  And thenne
Pa¦rys departed fro Vyenne wyth grete sorowe and heuynesse  And took
his waye wyth hys seruaunte tyl he came to the ry∣uer wh••re they coude not tofore haue passed  and as despayred doubted noo
thynge but entred the••m  and the water was soo aualed that they passed wyth∣oute ony peryl 
And they rode two dayes wythoute ony mete  for they durst not passe
thurgh ony toun  And they passed tyl they came to aygues mortes  And
there he founde the galeye that george had hyred  whyche anone he
took  and so longe sayl¦led and rowed tyl that they arryued at Gene 
Parys made meruayllous countenaunces in the galeye  that alle they that
were therin  had supposed he had be a fool  for allewaye he was pe••syf  and ymagynatyf  and vnnethe wold speke ne say a word  Thenne
whan he was at gene he hyred hym a lodgyng & lyued there in grete
heuynesse & sorowe  Now leue we to speke of Parys and retorne we to
vy¦enne whyche abode in the chape∣layns hous


        How vyenne was founde in the chyrche by a foteman  and how she
        was brought ageyn to hyr fader 

WHan Parys was depar∣ted fro vyenne she abode allone wyth ysabeau
ma¦kyng the grettest sorowe of the world that it was a grete pyte to
byholde  lyke as she had as leef to deye as to lyue  And whan she was
wel wery of we∣pyng  and that it was force that she must retorne to the
mer∣cy of hyr fader the doulphyn  she appeased hyr self  And anone the
chapelayn went for to seche the foteman and brought hym in to the ••hyrche  And whan Vyenne sawe hym  she knewe hym wel  For she had
oftymes seen hym in hyr faders hows  And thys man sayd to hyr alle hys
charge  & that many knygh¦tes were oute for to seche hyr  And Vyenne
sayd to hym goo & telle them that thou hast foun¦den me here  & brynge
them hy∣ther  Thenne the man wente & fonde the knyghtes that thenne
were comen in to the towne  and tolde to them how he had foūden hyr  &
that they shold come with hym & he wold brynge them to the place where
she was  whan y^e knyʒtes herde these tydynges a∣non eche made grete
haste tyl they cam to hyr  thēne whā they were


      

tofore vyenne they salewed hyr and sayd to hyr that the doul∣phyn had
doo seche hyr in dy∣uers contreyes  and after they comforted hyr  and
sayd that she shold not be aferde of hyr fader  for he wold doo to hyr
noo desplaysyr  for be shal haue so grete Ioye  whan he shall see
you  that he shal pardonne you and appease hys yre 

And than Incontynent they wente to horsbacke  and brought forth the
chapelayn wyth hyr to thende that he shold excuse hyr tofore hyr fader 
and tolde how she was pure and clene of hyr body 

NOw sayth ••hystory that whan Vyenne was co∣men tofore hyr fader the doulphyn  he
made toward hyr heuy and euyll ••here  But not wythstondyng Vyenne kneled doun on bothe hyr knees to the
erthe sayeng and in wepyng  Redoubted fader I see wel and knowe in my
self that I haue mesprysed and faylled toward you  wherof I haue grete
des∣playsyr  Neuertheles folysshe loue hath enforced me to loue hym 
whyche is wel worthy to be byloued of the moost grettest lady of the
Royame of fraunce allewaye seen the noblenes that is in hym  For I wene
that in alle the world is none to hym lyke ne pareylle  And also I
thynke that I am not the first that haue trespaced by sembla∣ble
reasons  wherfore redoubted fader I am in your mercy  and take of me
vengeaunce  suche as shal playse you  and to me chas¦tysement  and
example to other Neuerth••les I wyl wel that ye knowe and that I ••swere by my soule  that I am as pure and clene of my body as I was▪
that day that I departed fro hens  And loo here is the chapelayn whyche
can say to you the trou∣the  And thenne the chapelayn tolde how she
came wyth in men of whom that one was a moche fayre knyght yonge &
curtoys the whyche I byleue is drowned in passyng a ryuer  And they
were in myn hous  and the two damoyselles slept to gyder in the
chyrche  and the knyght slepte wyth me  And the other two slepte in
the stable with the hor∣ses  Thenne whan the doulphyn herde these
tydynges he had ryʒt grete playsyr  of which he made noo semblaunte 
and gaf to the chapelayn moche money & g••••te yeftes  and bad hym retorne  After the doulphyn took vy∣enne by
the hande  in repreuyng hyr moche gretely  and lad hyr in to hyr
moders chambre wyth ysabeau  for hir moder was seke of the grete sorowe
that she had for hyr doughter  and there the


      

moder blamed them bothe two  And ysabeau sayd that vyenne was as pure
and clene of hyr body as she was the day that she departed  Alas sayd
the doul∣phyn  thou hast put vs in the moost grettest shame of y^e
world And I promyse that alle they that haue consented therto shal be
wel punysshed  ••nd in espe∣cyal that euyl traytre Parys whych is cause of al thys fayte
and yf euer I may haue hym I shal make dogges deuoure hym and also bothe
ye tweyne shal suffre therfore grete penytence  Thenne sayd vyenne
wepyng  I see wel and knowe that ye haue enten••ion to do to me moche gryef and harm  and I see wel that my lyf shal
not longe en∣dure  Therfore I swere to you in good fayth  that there
is noo man in the world that I so mo∣che loue as I doo hym whom ye so
menace and thretene  For in hym I haue my thought & cou∣rage wythoute
euer to faylle hym  and yf ye shortly gyue to me my penaunce  so moche
short¦ly shal be my deth  And yf ye suffre me to endure it longe  so
moche more shal I bere it  and my soule shal be the more sure to fore
almyghty god  & knowe ye for certayn that for hym and hys loue I am
redy to deye  Thēne the doulphyn yssued out of the chambre in grete
Indyg∣nacyon  and commaunded that the fader of Parys shold be put in an
euyl pryson  And that al hys goodes shold be taken fro hym  And also
that vyenne & ysabeau shold be enclosed in a chambre  and that wel
lytell mete shold be gyuen to them  and moche he menaced and thre∣tened
them  and thus they a∣bode a longe tyme in that cham∣bre  and
contynuelly Vyenne dremed of Parys 

And whan she myght haue ony space to speke to Edward felowe of Parys 
she requyred hym that he shold serche yf he myght haue ony tydynges of
pa¦rys  and that he shold lete hyr knowe therof  In thys ma¦ner
vyenne passed hyr tyme in grete sorowe & in grete thought alle waye
desyryng for to here somme tydynges of that noble knyght Parys 

WHan Vyenne had ben a grete tyme in thys ma∣nere  The doulphyn
by∣thought hym that thenne hys doughter Vyenne had been wel chastysed 

And thennne the Doulphyn fader of Vyenne ordeyned that she came oute of
pryson  And thēne he purposed to gyue to hyr an husbond  and sette hyr
in hyr fyrst estate  wherof alle the


      

courte was moche Ioyous  and in especyal Edward felowe of Parys  And
after certayn tyme the doulphyn wrote to the Erle of Flaunders that he
wold doo marye hys doughter vyēne wherupon he requyred hym that he wold
gyue to hym counceyll in thys mater  For it was vnto hym chargeable 
And duryng the tyme that vyenne was oute of pryson hyr herte was neuer
in reste  but euer she was heuy and sorouful for hyr swete and faythful
frende parys  whome she myght not see  and knewe not whether he were
dede or a lyue  And whan the doulphyn sawe hyr so heuy  On a day he
sayd to hyr  My swete dough∣ter  wherfore be ye so sorouful  gyue
your self to playfyr  For as to me I remembre nomore the thynges
passed  And there is noo thynge in the world that ye demaunde me but I
shal doo it for you  And thenne vyēne whyche had not forgeten Pa∣rys
sayd to hym  Honourable fader yf I were sure of the thyn¦ges passed
that they were for∣goten by you  I shold be more sure than I am  but I
byleue fermely  that ye haue them yet in your remembraunce  For ye
holde alwaye messyre Iaques in pryson the fader of Parys  whyche is not
culpable of ony parte of thys dede ne cause  And yf ye wold do to me
soo moche grace that ye wold par∣donne hym and rendre to hym al hys
goodes & thynges I shold be moche Ioyous  And the doul¦phyn for the
playsyr of hys doughter sayd to hyr  that it wel playsed to hym  and
Incon∣tynt the doulphyn dyd do dely∣uer messyre Iaques out of pry∣son 
and dyd do retorne to hym al hys goodes and thynges that had be taken
from hym  wherof messyre Iaques had grete play∣syr  for yf he had
abyden leng••r in pryson he had be dede for hun∣gre  for there was none that
com¦forted hym but edward  whiche comforted hym the best wyse he
myght  & gaf to hym dayly that whyche was necessarye for hys lyf  whan
vyenne knewe that messyre Iaques was oute of pryson  she was moche
Ioyeful and had grete playsyr  Ne∣uertheles al the consolacyon of
vyenne was whan she myght speke wyth edward of hyr loue Parys  And thus
she passed hyr tyme in ryght grete payne and heuynesse the beste wyse
she myght 

WHan the Erle of flaun¦ders had redde the let∣ters of the doulphyn &
vnderstood that he wold marye his doughter vyēne whych was


      

of the age ef xv yere  he trayted that she shold haue of two ba∣rons
that one  that is to wete the sone of the kyng of englond  or the sone
of the duke of bour∣goyne  whyche thenne had grete renomme•• in fraunce  and that was for the grete prowesse that was in hym  and
the sayd erle made thys sayd traytye  & sente word vnto the doulphyn 
that hym semed best that the sone of the du•• of bourgoyn were beste for ••yr  by cause that it shold be grete playsyr to the Kynge of fraunce 
and that he was a no∣ble knyght and of grete pro∣wesse  and whan the
doulphyn had receyued these letters fro therle of Flaunders  he sente
to the kyng of fraunce to wyte of hym whyche shold best playse hym of
these two prynces afore∣sayd that shold haue his dough¦ter For whome
that he wold shold haue hyr  wherof y^e kyng had grete playsyr  and
reputed it to hym grete honour  And he sente to hym worde  that it
shold playse hym best that he maryed wyth the sone of the duc of
bour¦goyn hys neuew  and in so do∣yng he shold doo to hym ryght grete
playsyr  and wold do as moche for hym whan tyme and place requyreth 
And seyng the doulphyn the wylle of the kyng of fraunce sente worde to
therle of flaunders  that he had coun∣seylled wyth hys barons  & also
that it was the wylle of the kyng of fraunce that his dough¦ter shold be
maryed to the sone of the duc of bourgoyne  And thenne therle laboured
so moche in thys mater that he made the sayd sone of the duc to agree as
for hys partye 


        How Parys sente a letter to hys felowe Edward 

NOw late vs leue to spe∣ke of thys mater  and retorne we vnto Parys
whyche abode in the cyte of gene moche heuy  and whyles thys maryage
was in trayty Parys dwelled in gene out of al Ioy∣es and pl••ysaunses worldly  & al for the loue that he had to the fayr vyenne
whome he had soo moche at his hert  And abode alwaye in hys lodgyng
allone  and bycame so deuoute and soo humble toward god  that it was
grete meruaylle  and also for the good countenaunces that he made  he
was moche wel by∣loued of al the peple of the cyte and they helde hym
for a noble man  and sayd he must nedes be the sone of a grete lord 
And Parys beyng in thys manere had grete desyre to haue tydyn∣ges of

hyr consolacy¦on was for to haue tydynges of you  & she recommaundeth
hyr to you as moche as she may  & hath moche grete desyre to see you &
also prayeth you not to wyth∣drawe you fro hyr ne fro that contreye  ••ut that ye wryte ofte to hyr of your estate  And she sendeth to you an

was wryten he delyuerd it to the courrour  whyche made hasty Iourneyes
so that he arryued at genes  where as the good knyʒt Parys dwelled and
abode 

WHan the noble paris had redde the letter  & knewe that vyenne had been
in pryson  almoost for sorowe he was oute of his wytte cursyng his euyl
fortune  & after he cur¦sed the day that he was borne & moche
dyscomforted hym self  & also he cursed the doulphyn say∣eng  O cruel
fader and vncon∣nyng  how may your hert suffre to put in pryson hyr
that is soo noble a creature  whyche is ful of al vertues  that is the
fayre vyenne  whyche is noo thynge cause of thys fayte  For I my self
onely haue doon it  & ought to bere allone the penaunce  alas &
wherfore dyd not god to me so moche grace  that I had be ta¦ken in
stede of hyr  O fayre vy∣enne what haue I doo for you  whyche haue
suffred soo moche payne for me  Thus he made a grete whyle hys sorowe
in we∣pyng strongely  After Parys sawe that the fayr vyenne was


      

retorned in to hyr fyrst estate  wherof he was moche Ioyous  & whan he
had receyued the es∣chaunge that vyenne had sente hym he hyred a moche
fayr hous & cladde hym honestly & rychely & took acqueyntaunce & amytye
wyth the grettest & beste of the cyte  in so moche they dyd hym moche

in hys hert the loue of vyenne  for alleway hys loue encreaced  And
euery moneth they wrote letters eche to other  of whyche here is made
noo mencyon  for it shold be o∣uer longe to reherce  & torne we here
in to flaunders for the fayte of the maryage of the excellent vyenne 

NOw sayth thystorye that whan therle of Flaun∣ders had accorded the
ma¦ryage with the duc of bourgoyn he made redy hys sone and appa¦raylled
hym of companye and of horses  and lete it be knowen to the doulphyn 
that he shold make redy al thynge necessarye  & that he shold hastely
sende to hym his sone  whan the doulphyn herde these tydynges  that
he  whome he so moche desyred shold come he was moche Ioyous  and
In∣contynent dyd doo make redy many grete & meruayllous fes∣tes  &
duryng the same dyd doo make redy hys sone the duc of bourgoyne  horses
and peple for to accompanye hym whiche was a fayre thynge to see  And
after sent hym to therle of flaū∣ders  whyche receyued hym wyth grete
Ioye & wyth grete honour & fested hym two dayes  and delyuerd to hym
hys sone in his companye  and sente hym to the doulphyn  & whan the
doulphyn knewe theyr comyng  he dyd do make redy to receyue hym  and
whan they were by a day Iour∣neye nygh vnto vyenne  he rode oute wyth
moche grete chyual∣rye  & receyued them with muche grete Ioye and
playsyr  & eche made grete feste to other whyche were ouer longe to

duc of bourgoyn  hee & hys wyf en∣tred in to the chambre of vyenne to
whome the doulphyn sayd  Fayr doughter it was the play syr of god that
I & your moder were to gyder vij yere wythoute hauyng ony chylde  and
in the viij yere our lord comforted vs wyth you  in whom we haue al our

suppose neuer to haue  so we truste that by you we haue one  It is trewe ••hot so as god wyl and hath ordeyned we wyl assemble you to a moche
honou∣ble maryage  the whiche to vs


      

playseth moche  for I ensure you the doughter of the Kynge of Fraunce
hath moche desyred to haue hym  that ye shal haue  for god hath
endowed hym with so moche good & honour as hert of knyght may haue 
thus to the playsyr of god  & of the vyr∣gyn marye  we haue made the
maryage of the sone of the duke of bourgoyne & of you  wherfor we praye
you  that therto ye wyl gyue your good wylle & play∣syr  and also that
ye wyl haue the maryage agreable  Thenne vyenne ansuerd to hyr fader 
Honourable fader & lord I wote wel that thys that ye entende is for my
wele & prouffyt  But not wythstondyng that I be in age for to marye  &
that in thys maryage I shold receyue honour more than I am worthy 
Neuer¦theles I shal not yet be maryed for yf we haue not thys man  yf
it playse god we shal haue another as good or better  And thynke ye not
myn honourable lord  that I say thys for ony ex¦cusacyon  but it is
sythen xv dayes that I haue be euyl dys∣posed of my persone  & the
ma¦ladye that I haue causeth me to take noo playsyr for to be ma∣ryed 
For I haue auowed vnto god neuer to be maryed to thys man ne to none
other  as longe as I shal be in thys maladye  Thenne thought the
dolphyn that vyenne sayd it for shame∣fastnes  Neuertheles he
trauayl¦led hyr euery day wyth fayre wordes that she shold consente to
thys maryage  but it auayl∣led nothyng all that he dyd  for the wylle
of hir was more in pa¦rys than in ony man of the world 

THenne on the morne the sone of the duc of bour∣goyne  & the sone of
the erle of Flaunders entred in to the cyte of vyenne  wherof the
doulphyn had grete Ioye & play¦syr  and thys feste endured wel fyftene
dayes  that they dyd no thynge  but daunce  synge  and dyd other
dyuers playsyrs  and duryng thys feste the doulphyn sayd to the sone of
the duke of bourgoyn to thende that he shold thynke none euyl by cause
he a∣bode so longe or he myght espouse hys doughter  Fayr sone I praye

thynge of thys longe abydyng here  for certayn my doughter is so seke 
that vn∣nethe she may speke  whyche doth to hyr grete desplaysyr and
shame  for fayn she wold be out of hyr chambre  And thenne the sone of
the duc of bourgoyn as he shat mente but good fayth  byleued it
lyghtly  Neuertheles the doulphyn dyd nothyng nyʒt


      

ne day  but admonested hys do∣ughter one tyme in fayr wor∣des  and
another tyme in me∣naces  but in no wyse he coude make hys doughter to
consente  And comaunded that she shold nothyng haue but brede & water
and vyenne abode one day soo in thys manere  and al thys dyd the
doulphyn  to thende that she shold consente to the maryage  and alwaye
he dyd to hyr more harme & payne  & vyenne was alwaye more harde  and
ferther fro hys desyre  wherof the doul∣phyn had moche grete
dysplay∣syr  and not wythoute cause  & seyng the Doulphyn that hys
doughter was soo Indurate  he thought that by somme good moyen he wold
sende home ageyn the sone of the duc of bourgoyn for he doubted that yf
he abode longe  that this feat myght be dyscouerd  and he gaf to hym
fayr Iewellys  and after sayd to hym  Fayre sone I wyl that ye take
noo desplaysyr in that I shal say to you  Me semeth wel that at thys
tyme this maryage may not goo forth of you and of my doughter  for
after that I see  & as me semethe the wylle of god is ferther than I
wold at thys tyme  For he wyl not that the maryage of you and of my
doughter take now effecte  wherfore I haue ryght grete des∣playsyr in
my hert onely for the loue of you  Thenne the sone of the duc of
bourgoyne seyng that at that tyme he myght doo noo thyng  toke leue of
the Doul∣phyn and retorned in to his con¦tree by cause that Vyenne was
not in helthe  and promysed that assone as he myght knowe that she
shold be hool  he wold retorne for to accomplysshe the mariage lyke as
the doulphyn had pro∣mysed to hym 


        How the doulphyn dyd doo enprysonne vyēne by cause that she
        wold not consente to the ma¦ryage to the sone of the duke of
        bourgoyne 

AFter certayn dayes that the sone of the Duke of bourgoyn was departed
fro the cyte of vyenne  the doul∣phyn for grete desplaysyr that he had
dyd do come tofore hym the mayster Iayler of hys pry∣son  and dyd doo
make wythin hys paleys a lytel pryson derke and obscure  and he dyd do
put vyenne and ysabeau in to that pryson  and commaunded that they
shold haue nothyng to ete but brede and water  and one damoysel in
whome the dolphyn trusted shold brynge it to them And in thys manere
vyenne & ysabeau passyd theyr tyme in grete sorowe  And thynke not that
for thys pryson  the hert of


      

vyenne wold in ony wyse con∣sente to the wylle of hyr fader  but alway
encreaced wyth hyr y^e wylle toward hir swete frende Parys  and wyth
swete wordes she comforted ysabeau sayeng  My dere suster abasshe you
not for thys derkenes  for I haue confydence in god  that ye shal haue
yet moche welthe  For my fayr suster  It is a moche ryght ful thyng
that for the good knyʒt parys whyche for me suffreth so moche payne 
that I suffre thys for hym  and also I say to you that al the paynes of
this world be nothyng greuous to me whan I thynke on hys swete vysage 
And in thys manere that one comforted that other  in spe∣kyng alle day
of the valyaunte knyght Parys 


        How the sone of the duc of bourgoyn departed fro hys con∣treye
        for to come see the fayre lady Vyenne 

WHan the sone of the duc of bourgoyne had aby¦den longe tyme in hys
contree  On a day he had grete thought of vyenne  & that was for the
grete beaute of hyr  and it dysplesed hym moche that at hys beyng there
he had not seen hyr  and so concluded to goo & see hyr  and it was not
longe after that he cam to the dolphyn and the doulphyn receyued hym
moche gladly and with grete ho∣nour  Thenne prayed he the dol¦phyn that
it myght plese hym to shewe to hym vyenne also seke as she was  For in
the world was nothyng that he soo moche desyred to see as hyr  And the
doulphyn seyng the wylle & de∣syre of hym wold noo lenger hyde hys
courage  but sayd to hym  My fayr sone by the fayth that I owe to
god  I haue had grete desyre that thys maryage shold be made  but my
dough∣ter for thys present tyme wyl take noo husbond ne be maryed
wherfore I haue grete desplaysyr and that for the loue of you  & to
thende that ye knowe  that it holdeth not on me  I swere to you that
sythe ye departed fro thys toun  I haue doon hyr to be kepte in a
pryson derke and obscure  and hath eten nothyng but brede and water
onely  and haue sworn that she shal not goo oute of pryson tyl she shal
con∣sente to haue you in maryage  And thus I praye you that ye take noo
desplaysyr  yf at thys tyme ye see hyr not  for ye may not faylle to
haue grete mary∣age  in caas that this faylle you and thenne he
ansuerd  honou∣rable syr I praye you moche her¦tely  syth that it is
so  that er I retorne I may speke to hyr  and I shal praye hyr as
moche as I


      

shal mowe  and shal see yf by ony manere I may conuerte hyr fro hyr
wylle  thenne sayd the doulphyn he was contente  Thenne he sente to
his doughter clothyng and vestymentes for to clothe hyr  and also mete
for to ete  For in two monethes she had eten but brede and water 
wherof she was moche feble  and that shewed wel in her vysage  & thus
he dyd by cause she shold consente to the maryage  And thenne it was
concluded  that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn shold come see hyr &
speke with hyr  and thenne whan Vyenne sawe thys and had re••••yued all & knewe that the sone of the duc of bourgoyn 〈…〉〈…〉 speke wyth hyr she 〈…〉〈…〉 hir damoysel  fayr 〈…〉〈…〉 how my fader & moder we•••• by these vestymentes & thys 〈◊〉〈◊〉 that I shold ete to deceyue me and put me fro my purpoos  but god for
bede that I shold do so  & thenne she took the henne  & sayd to hyr
that brought it  syth it playseth to the sone of the duke to come &
speke to me  say ye to hym that he may not come these iij dayes  &
whan he cometh that he brynge with hym the bysshop of Saynt laurens 
She that had brought to hyr the henne sayd alle thys vnto the doulphyn
and to dame ••y••ne hir moder  Thenne vy∣enne took the two quarters of the henne and
put them vnder hyr arme hooles  and helde them there so longe  that
they stonken moche strongely  And whan it came to the thyrd day  the
bysshop of Saynt Laurence and the sone of the Duke of Bour∣goyne camen
for to see vyenne  and or they entred they ope∣ned a treylle whyche gaf
lyght in to the pryson 

Thenne whan the sone of the duc sawe Vyenne in the pryson he sayd to
hir by grete pyte that he had  Noble vyenne how wyl ye deye thus for
hungre soo fo∣lyly by your owne defaulte  And knowe ye not wel that
your fader hath gyuen you to me to haue to my wyf  wher∣fore I lyue in
grete payne  and in moche grete sorowe for the du¦resse of your
courage  wherof ye doo ryght grete synne  And doubte ye not that god
punys∣sheth you for thynobedyence that ye doo to your fader and to your
moder  wherfore I praye you fayre Vyenne to telle to me for what cause
ye wyl not haue me in maryage to your husbond  Doubte ye that whan ye
shall be wyth me  that ye may not serue god as wel as ye now do that
suffre thys payne  I promyse you by my fayth y^t ye shal haue
playsaunces and lybertees in al the maners that ye shal conne
de¦maunde  Thenne I praye you


      

that ye wyl not here deye so dolo¦rously  and yf ye wyl not doo it for
the loue of me  yet at the leste do it for the loue of your fa¦der and
of your moder whyche lyue for you in grete sorowe and in grete
heuynesse  wherfore ye ought to haue pyte on them 

WHan Vyenne had herde these wordes she was quasi abasshed and sayd syr
sauyng your honour I am maryed  how be it ye knowe hym not whome I haue
in myn hert  And also I knowe and graunte ryght wel that ye be worthy
to haue one moche gret∣ter and more hye a lady than I am  and I la••e you wete that for hym that I desyre I shold suffre more payne than I
fele  And therfore I praye you that fro hens forth ye speke to me no
more of thys mater  And also I am so euyl dysposed in my per∣sone that
yf it endure in me  my lyf shal not be longe  and yf it were honeste I
shold shewe it you and than shold ye see how it stondeth wyth me 
Neuertheles approche ye ner to me  & ye shall the better byleue me 
And the sone of the duke of bourgoyne & the bysshop of saynt laurence
ap¦prouched vnto vyenne  fro whom yssued soo grete a stenche  that
vnnethe they myght suffre and endure it  whiche sauour came fro vnder
hyr arme holes of the two quarters of the henne  whi∣che were roten 
And whan vy∣enne sawe that they had felte y∣nough of the stenche she
sayd to them  lordes ye may now knowe ynough in what aduenture I am
dysposed  Thenne they took leue hauyng grete compassyon on hyr  And
they sayd to the dolphyn that vyenne was thēne half roten and that she
stanke  and demed in them self that she myght not lyue longe  qnd that
it shold be grete damage of hyr deth for the souerayn beaute that was in
hyr  And Incontynent the sone of the duc of bourgoyn took hys leue of
the doulphyn  and retorned in to hys contrey  and recounted to hys
fader the lyf of vyenne  wherof alle they that herde hym had grete pyte
in theyr herte 

WHan the doulphyn sawe that the maryage was broken  by the deffaulte of
his doughter Vyēne  he sware that she shold neuer departe fro thens 
but yf she wold consente to hys wylle 

And so she abode longe tyme in that pryson where she had grete thought
and sorowe for hyr swete and trewe frende parys  & hyr desyre was on
noo thyng but for to here tydynges of pa∣rys hyr loue  But in the estate


      

that she was in  no man myght brynge hyr tydynges  And Ed¦ward the
felowe of Parys se∣yng that Vyenne abode in soo grete payne  and that
none durst speke to hyr  he had in his herte grete sorowe  & was moche
moe∣ued of grete pyte  and also for the grete loue that he had to
pa∣rys  And concluded to make a chapel in the chyrche that tou∣ched the
palays of the dolphyn and in a corner he dyd do dygge so depe that it
was nyghe to the foundement of the pryson  where in vyenne was  and by
cause he wold not haue the thyng dys∣closed  he wold that they shold
dygge no ferther  and whan the chapel was achyeued and fy∣nysshed 
Edward alle allone dygged hym self so ferre  that he made an hole  by
whyche he spake to vyenne whan he wold whyche caue was made so secret∣ly
that no man myʒt apperceyue it  Soo it happed on a day Ed∣ward byhelde
vyēne thurgh this hole  & salewed hyr  & thenne whan vyenne herd hym &
kne∣we hym  she had so grete Ioye & consolacyon  that she semed that
she was rysen fro deth to lyf  & the fyrst tydynges that Vyenne
demaunded of hym were yf he knewe ony tydynges of parys & edward tolde
to hir that it was not longe syth  that he had recey∣ued a letter fro
hym  wryton at genes  Thenne said vyēne al we¦pyng to hym  alas whan
shal y^e day come that I shal see hym  & that doon I wold be cōtente
that god shold do his wylle of me  for none other thyng I desyre in
this world  Alas fayr brother what semeth you of my lyf & of this fayr
chambre in whyche I dwelle in  certeynly I byleue ve¦ryly  that yf
parys knewe it  y^t for his loue I suffre thus moche sorowe  that the
hert of hym shold swelte for sorowe  and after she tolde to Edward the
parlament that she had with the sone of the duc of bourgoyne  & also of
the henne  & prayed hym y^t he wold sende worde of al thys to parys &
that she recommaunded hyr to hym  & also that she had none other hope
in thys world but in hym  Edward brought to hyr euery day fro thēne
forthon mete & drynke  & al that was necessa¦rye to hyr  for hyr lyf 
& comfor∣ted hyr with fayr wordes the best wyse he myght  & Edward
wrote al playnly to parys  how for hungre she shold haue been dede  ne
had he ben  whyche dayly pourueyed for hyr al that was to hym
necessarye  and he wrote to hym alle the manere that Vy∣enne had holden
wyth the sone of the Duke of Bourgoyne And that thys fayre lady Vy∣enne
desyred noo thynge in this world but for to see hym onely


      

And also that she prayed hym that he shold not departe oute of the
contree that he was in 

WHan the noble Parys had receyued the letter fro Edward and knewe that
vyenne abode in pryson  it is no nede to demaunde yf he had grete
despaysyr  & almoost was in suche caas  as to l••se his wytte for sorowe  And on that other pa••••e he had grete drede that she shold be maryed in eschewyng of the grete
harme & payne that she suffred  and herein he was pensyf nyght and
day  sayeng to hym self  I see wel that I may not escape but that
vyenne must nedes be maryed  and by that moyen hyr loue and myn shal
faylle  Alas now see I wel that now me byhoueth noo hoope ne truste 
Alas caytyf and vnhap∣py what shal byfalle of me  I shal goo so ferre 
that fro hyr I may neuer here tydynges  ne al∣so she fro me  and after
this he bygan ageyn hys complaynte sayeng  O ve••ay god of heuen wherfore hast thou not doon to me soo moche grace  that
in the stede of hyr I myght suffre the payne that she suffreth for me 
O cruel fortune ful of cruel tormente  and what hath vyēne doon or
made that she must suf∣fre so gr••uous penaunce  Alas were it not more reason  Iustyce and cause that I
whyche haue doon alle thys euyl bere the pu∣nycyon  certes yes 


        How Parys sente a letter to Edward hys felowe 

AFter that he had made hys cōplaynte  he wrote a letter vnto Edward 
doyng hym to wyte how he had souerayn sorowe for vyēne whi∣che was in
pryson  and he than∣ked hym of the goodnes and dylygence that he had
doon to∣ward hyr  in prayeng hym that he neuer wold faylle hyr  but
contynuelly ayde and helpe hyr  And after he wrote to hym how for
veray dysplaysyr and melancolye he wold goo in to somme straunge
contreye  And that fro than forthon he shold sende to hym noo moo
letters  And that he neuer reiche for to here moo tydynges fro hym 
no∣more than of a deed persone  Thenne whan Edward had receyued these
letters fro Paris and knewe that he wold ••s∣traunge hym fro that contree of genes  and wold goo in to a strange
contreye he was moche wroth and sore agryeued  And thenne Incontynent
pa∣rys wente and tolde it to the fader and moder of Parys 


      

wherof they toke so grete sorowe that they supposed to haue loste theyr
wytte  And after edward wente and tolde it also to vy∣enne  wherof it
nedeth not to de∣maunde the grete sorowe that she, had  for it was so
grete and o∣uermoche  that yf edward had not comforted hyr  she had
been dede  And thenne she complay∣ned to ysabeau sayeng that sy∣then
she neuer entended to here tydynges of hyr loue Parys she was ryght wel
contente to deye and that she wold neuer more haue playsyr of no thynge
that was in thys world  and that thenne she wold that she were dede 
And ysabeau comforted hyr alwaye


        How parys wente to shyppe at venyse  for to goo to the holy sepul••re in Iherusalem 

AFter that pari•• had sent the letter to Edward In contynent he departed fro genes wyth

that it was meruaylle  and prayed contynuelly our lord that by the
meryte of his passyon he wold gyue to hym saluacyon of hys soule  &

he dwel¦lyd moche heuy and sorouful


      

for hys Infortune  And also he had grete desplaysyr whan he sawe other

y^e souldan was moche Ioyous  and for loue of thye faulcon  the
souldan made the fawlconner a grete s••rd in hys courte  Thenne the faulcon∣ner seyng that by the moyen of
parys he had goten thys lord∣shyp  he dyd to hym moche play¦syr  &
shewed to hym as grete amytye and frendshyp as be had ben hys brother 
& brought hym in the grace of the souldan  and was receyued in to hys
courte  & the souldan loued hym soo wel  that he gaf to hym grete
offyce  and mayntened hym in grete ho¦nour  ye shal vnderstonde that
in thys tyme regned a moche holy pope  the whych was named In∣nocent 
and was a moche holy persone & ••••uoute  And it ple∣sed soo hym that he gaf oute a croysee  ayenst the
fals myscre∣auntes & hethen men  to the ende that the name of our lord
Ihesu cryst were more sayntefyed and enhaunced thurgh out al
crysty¦ente  And therfore was maad a grete counceyl emonge the
car∣dynals and prelates  & was concluded by theyr parlament that thys
croysee shold be wry∣ton to the kyng of fraunce  and to other kynges
crysten  dukes  Erles and other grete lordes  and so was it doon 


        How the doulphyn came to∣ward the kyng of Fraunce 


      

WHan the kyng of france had receyued the letters fro the pope 
Incontynēt he sente for the doulphyn of vy∣ennoys  that he shold come
and speke wyth hym  the whiche In∣contynent came at his
commaun¦dement  Thenne the kynge sayd to hym  Syr Godefroy  we haue
made you to come hyther  for ye be one of y^e moost wysest of our
courte  & also ye be of our lyg∣nage  And we late you wete that our
holy fader the pope hath wryton to vs that he hath yeuen a croysee
ayenst the mescreaūtes wherfore we for the loue and re∣uerence of god
entēde for to goo thyder  Neuertheles we haue ad¦uysed  that ye shold
goo fyrst in to thoo partyes  & we praye you for the loue and reuerence
of god that ye take on you the charge for to espye the contrees and also
the passages  Thenne the doulphyn sayd  I am redy & apparaylled to do
your comaun∣dement wyth good wylle  But how shal I mowe doo it for to
passe surely emonge the hethen peple  For yf they apperceyue in ony
wyse that I goo for to espye theyr contree  I shal not conne escape 
but that I must deye by cruel deth yf god kepe me not  Thenne sayd the
kyng ye may goo and your companye surely clothed in habyte of
pyl¦gryms  for ye knowe wel that thys is not the fyrst tyme  that many
crysten men haue been in the holy londe  wherfor I praye you yet eft
ones that in y^e name of Ihesu cryst that ye make you redy for to goo
thyder  and take wyth you of our knyghtes as meny as it shal playse
you  Thenne the doulphyn seyng the wylle of the kyng  and that
Incontynent he must departe  he sente letters to hys wyf  that he wold
goo in to the holy londe to seche the holy sayntuaryes & pylgrymages 
and prayed hyr that she moche wysely shold go∣uerne hys londe  & that
vyenne hys doughter shold not escape oute of pryson tyl he retourned for
in shorte tyme he wold come ageyn 


        How the Doulphyn took hys shyppyng for to goo in to Iherusalem 

AFter that the doulphyn had taken hys shyppe  & passed in to Surrye and
damaske  to Iherusalem and in many other places  & had ad∣uysed and
espyed moche wysely and wel alle the contree  And enquyred of the
crysten men that dwellyd there many thynges  without dyscoueryng his
wylle and entente  Neuertheles somme euyl crysten men for to gete
mo¦ney tolde it vnto the souldan of


      

babylone  Thenne whan the souldan knewe it  he maad noo semblaunte 
but Incontynent he made all the passages to be kept where as the
pylgryms went by in suche manere as the doulphyn was taken & alle hys
companye wyth hym in a place called Ra∣mon not ferre fro Iherusalem 
whyche was brought tofore the souldan  and he ordeyned that the
doulphyn shold be tormen∣ted and pyned  The doulphyn seyng hym self in
suche a poynte sayd that they shold not tor∣mente hym  and he wold say
to them the trouthe  & thus he re∣counted to the souldan how the Pope
had gyuen oute a croysee ayenst them  & how he was comen to espye the
contreye  whan the souldan sawe thys  he sayd that he wold aduyse hym
of what deth he wold do hym to deth  in maner that al other shold take
ensaumple  And commaunded that anone he shold be ledde in to
alysandrye  & there to be put in to an harde pryson  and also that
none shold gyue to hym but brede and water  Thenne the doulphyn was
brought in to Alysandrye  & was put in to an hard and stronge toure  &
there he suffred a myserable lyf  and had kepars that kept hym nyʒt and
day  Thus was the doul∣phyn in grete sorowe  thynkyng neuer to yssue
out of y^e pryson but dede  Neuertheles the Pope and the kyng of
Fraunce  dyd ofte tymes grete payne to haue hym out by fynaunces  but
they myght not haue hym  For the souldan sayd that he shold do on hym
suche punycyon  that al other shold take ensaumple••  Now late vs leue to speke of the doulphyn  and retorne we to Parys
that knewe no thynge of these tydynges

NOw recounteth thystorye that parys was in baby∣lone lyke as ye haue
to∣fore herde  whyche knewe noo thynge of thys fayte  So it hap¦ped
that by aduenture ij freres relygyous sought thyndulgen∣ces of the holy
lande & aryueden in babylone  where they wold see the seygnorye & the
puyssaunce of the sowdan  For thenne the sowdan helde hym in Babylone
wyth moche grete puyssaunce  These two freres were of these partyes 
whyche beyng in tho partyes it happed as they wente in the towne parys
fonde them  Thenne parys salewed them & demaunded of these partyes and
sayd to them in thys manere  After that I haue herde say e∣monge you
crysten men ye haue a Pope  the whyche is moche stronge & puyssaunt 
And also ye haue many kynges  & grete lordes  & so grete townes cytees


      

and castellys  that I haue mer∣ueyll how ye suffre that we that be not
of your lawe haue the seygnorye of the holy lande whi¦che ought to
apperteyne to you as ye say  And whan the freres had herde Parys thus
speke  they were sore aferde  And one of them ansuerd in the langage
of moure  For they wyst none other but parys was a moure  & so dyd al
they of the contrey  & he sayd to hym  Syr I byleue wel that ye haue
herd say  that in our partyes been assembled grete companyes of peple &
men of warre for to come in to thyse partyes  by cause that our holy
fader the Pope  hath graunted oute a croysee  and in the tyme whyles
our men of warre assem¦bled  the kynge of fraunce whi∣che is the
grettest of crystyente  sente a noble baron whyche is named the
doulphyn of vyen∣noys for to vysyte and espye these partyes  Thenne he
beyng in these partyes  the souldan sette men in suche places where as
the pylgryms were accustomed to passe  And sodeynly he dyd do tak•• hym in a cyte named Ra∣mon  and after sente hym in to Alysandrye  and
there sette hym in an euyl pryson  wherein I suppose that he be dede 
and thus for thys cause  the fayt was dys¦couerd  Thenne sayd Parys
how is that lord named  Thenne sayd the frere  he is named godefroy of
Allaunson doulphyn of vy∣ennoys  And whan parys herde thys he was moche
abasshed  but he made noo semblaunter  And thought in hys hert  that
hys ad¦uenture myght yet come to good and effecte  Thenne he demaun∣ded
them of many thynges  and sayd to them  that he wold more speke to
them another tyme  and demaunded them where they were lodged  and they
tolde hym more for drede than for loue  for they thought he wold haue
doon to them somme harme 

WHan Parys was depar¦ted fro the freres  he was moche pens yf how and
in what maner he myght goo in to Alexandrye for to see the doul∣phyn  &
how he myght gete hym onte of pryson  and so moche he thought on his
fayte  that he pur¦posed to goo to the hostry where the freres were
lodged  and soo wente thyder  & whan the freres sawe hym  they were
sore aferde Thenne parys took them by the handes  and ladde them to
solace thurgh y^e cyte spekyng of many thynges alwaye in the langage of
moure  & sayd to them  I haue grete desyre to see that crysten knyght
whiche is in alexandrye For I haue alwaye had good wylle to the crysten
men  perad∣uenture I myght yet wel helpe


      

hym  & yf ye wyl come with me I promyse you by my lawe  that I shal
make you good chere  & doubte ye nothyng  and thenne whan the freres
herde hym thus speke they wyst not what to an∣suer  they had so grete
fere  Ne¦uertheles they trustyng in the mercy of god  they promysed
hym  that they shold goo wyth hym  though they shold deye  & prayden
god in theyr courage that he wold graunte grace that he myght come oute
of pryson  Thenne Parys had grete play∣syr of the ansuer of the freres
& wende neuer to see y^e houre  that he myght be wyth the doulphyn for
to see the ende of his aduen∣ture  and so departed fro the fre∣tes 
and wente strayte to the faulconner of the souldan wyth whom he had
grete knowleche  & sayd to hym  Seynour I thanke you of the grete
honour  curto∣sye & gentylnes that ye haue do to me  & playse it you
to wyte that I wyl departe fro hens in to alysandrye  and I promyse to
you that for your loue I shall not tarye longe  but that I shal retorne
hyther ageyn  And by cause I am there vnknowen  and that I neuer was
there  I praye you ryght humbly  that I myʒt haue a maundement ••f the soul¦dan  that he commaunde to the gouernours that I may goo
tho¦rugh alle hys londe surely  For ye knowe wel that one may not kepe
hym ouer wel fro euyl pe∣ple  Therfore I praye you and requyre that ye
wyl gete me suche a maundement  and also that ye wyl commaunde me
hum¦bly to the good grace of my lord the souldan  and forthwyth the
faulconner wente to the souldan and made hys requeste for Pa∣rys  &
Incontynent the souldan graunted hym al hys desyre  say¦eng that it
moche desplaysed hym  of the departyng of parys & yf he wold abyde &
dwelle in hys courte he wold make hym a grete lord  Thenne the
faul∣conner sayd  Dere syr he hath promysed me  that in short tyme he
shal retorne  Thenne the soul∣dan dyd do make the maunde∣ment lyke as
he wold deuyse  chargyng al his lordes offycers & subgettes of townes
cytres & castellys of his londe that they shold do to hym grete honour 
& that they shold gyue & delyuer to hym al that shold be necessa∣rye to
hym wythout takyng ony money or ony other thynge of hym  And also the
souldan gaf to Parys many ryche clothes & vestymentes of cloth of gold
and of sylke  and also he gaf to hym grete tresour  prayeng hym that
he shold not longe tarye  but has¦tely retorne ageyn  & promysed hym
that he shold make hym a grete lord  and delyuerd hys


      

maundement  the whyche was sealed wyth the propre seale of the
souldan  and sygned wyth hys owne hande

WHan Parys had recey∣ued alle these thynges that the souldan had gy¦uen
to hym  he took leue of hym and of hys courte & went with the freres in
to Alexandrye  In∣contynent after he was comen he shewed the maundement
to the admyral  the whyche anon after he had seen it dyd grete honour
to Parys  and delyuerd to hym a fayr lodgyng pourueyed of al thynges
necessarye  and de∣lyuerd another to the freres  Thadmyral came euery
day to see parys in hys lodgyng for to do hym honour and companye  and
wente & rode to gyder tho∣rugh the cyte  and by cause that Parys was
rychely clad  euery man made to hym grete honour and sayd that he semed
wel to be the sone of sōme grete moure And on a day as they rode in the
cyte they passed forth by the toure where as the dolphyn was in pryson 
Thenne Parys de∣maunded of the admyral what toure it was that was so
fayre  Thenne he tolde to hym y^t it was a moche cruel pryson &
terryble In whyche the souldan helde a prysonner a grete lord & baron of
the theste  whyche was comen for tespye these contreyes  Thēne sayd
parys I praye you late vs goo see hym  & the admyral sayd he shold
gladly  Thenne they a∣lyghted fro their horses  & en∣tred in to the
pryson  and whan parys sawe the doulphyn  he had in hys hert grete
desplaysyr  by cause of the myserable & sorouful lyf that he suffred 
& Parys de∣maūded of y^e kepars what man he was  And they sayd  that
he was a grete baron of Fraunce  Thenne sayd parys  vnderston∣deth he
mourysshe  and they sayd nay  but that notwythstondyng yf he wold
speke to hym  that they shold fynde tour••hem••n ••∣nough  Thenne sayd Parys he wold retorne another day for to demaunde
of hym of the partyes of the weste  & prayed thadmyral to gyue
comandement to the ke∣pars  that as ofte as be sh••••d come  that they shold shewe hym to hym  & Incontynent he coman∣ded
lyke as parys had desyred  & thenne they departed  & a fewe dayes
after parys retorned and came to the pryson and brought one of the
freres wyth hym that coude speke mouryske  & whan they were wythin the
pryson  pa∣ris sayd to the frere that he shold salewe hym curtoysly 
Neuerthe¦les the frere knewe noo thynge that parys coude speke
frensshe  Thenne the frere sayd to the doul¦phyn  that that lord was come


      

for to vysyte hym  & that he loued wel crysten men  & that he was wel
in the grace of the souldan  and that he trusted ys moche in hym as in
ony man of hys con∣treye  & thus the frere demaun∣ded many thynges of
the doul∣phyn in the name of parys  and sayd yf he myght doo for hym he
wold gladly

WHan the doulphyn herde the relygious frere thus speke in the persone of
the moure  he was moche abas∣shed in hys courage  bysechyng our lord
that he wold put hym in suche courage & good wylle for to brynge hym out
of pryson Parys desyred to here tydyn∣ges of the fayr vyenne sayd to the
frere  that he shold aske of the doulphyn yf he had ony wyf or
chyldren  Thenne the dolphyn began to wepe  & said that he had a wyf 
& a doughter holden for the fayrest of Fraunce  whom he helde in pryson
bycause she wold take noo husbond  Thenne paris began to comforte hym
by the mouthe of the frere  sayeng that he shold take alle in
pacyence  & god shold yet ones delyuer hym oute of pryson  by whyche
wor∣des the doulphyn was so reioy∣ced & Ioyous  that hym semed that god
had appyered to hym  & the doulphyn sayd to the frere that it was grete
pyte that the moure was not crysten  & pray∣ed our lord that he wold
gyue to hym puyssaunce to kepe hym in that good wylle that he had & so
departed that one fro that other moche comforted  Thenne parys sayd to
the kepars that he had founde so grete playsyr in the prysonner  that
he wold ofte tymes come for to dyspo••te hym and they sayd whan it playsed hym he shold retorne & be
wel∣come  and thenne parys sayd to the freres that were in y^t place yf
I thought to be sure of you  I thynke wel to fynde the moyen to brynge
thys prysonner out of pryson  & the freres were moche admerueylled of
thys whiche pa¦rys had sayd to them  and they sayd to hym  by the
fayth that we owe to our god  that of vs ye nede not to doubte  & in
caas that ye be in wylle late vs assaye but it must be doon secretely 
for ye see wel how many kepars been there contynuelly  Thenne sayd
Parys I shal gyue to you good counceyl and remedye of alle thys  but I
wyl haue two thynges  The fyrst thynge is I wyl that ye goo wyth me 
That other is that he shal gyue to me my lyuyng honourably in hys
contre  for I am in grete doubte whan I haue delyuerd hym  and shal be
in hys contreye that he wyl sette nought by me  and I can noo mestyer
ne crafte  and


      

soo I myght be wel deceyued  Therfore yf he wyl assure me  & that he
wyl gyue to me a yefte suche as I shal demaunde hym whan I shal be in
hys contreye  I shal delyuer hym & shal leue my contree for loue of
hym  & ye may see in what estate I am 

On the morne Parys and the freres came in to the pryson & the frere
recoun∣ted al thys to the doulphyn  & whan the doulphyn vnderstood
thys  hym thought that god bare hym awaye  & sayd  I thanke god &
thys moure of the good wylle that he hath toward me  For I neuer dyd
hym seruyce ne playsyr wherfore he ought to do so moche for me 
Neuertheles I hope that is the playsyr of god that he shal delyuer me
oute of pryson  I am redy to swere vpon the body of Ihesu Cryst or I
euer departe from hens  that assone as I shal be in myn owne lande I
shal mayntene hym in more gretter estate  than he ne is here and I wyl
that he doo alle hys wylle of al my londe  for it shal suffyse to me
onely that I haue a ••yuyng for me and my wyf  and I shal do al that he wylle  and so say ye
to hym on my be∣halue  And thenne the frere tolde al to parys that
whych the doul¦phyn had sayd and promysed to do  and to thende that
parys shold be more sure  he sayd to the frere that he shold brynge to
fore hym the body of our lord Ihesu cryst  and that tofore hym he shold
swere to holde alle that he promysed  and the frere tolde it to Parys 
and the doulphyn sware it tofore Parys to accom∣plysshe alle that he had
promysed And whan he had sworne  to the ende that Parys shold be the
better contente  the doulphyn re∣ceyued the precyous body of our lord
Ihesu Cryst  sayeng that it shold be to the dampnacyon of hys soule 
in caas that he accom∣plysshed not al that he had pro∣mysed whan they
shold be in his londe  and whan thys was doo parys and the freres
departed fro the doulphyn  and wente to the porte  for to wyte yf
there were ony fuste that wold come hytherward  and by aduenture they
fonde a fuste  and Parys wyth the freres spake to the pa∣trone  and
promysed hym a M besaunts of gold yf they wold lete haue passage fyue
persones  The Patron seyng the grete tre∣sour  sayd to them that he
was contente  but he wold haue half at the porte  and sayd to them 
lordes I praye you make you re∣dy  For in caas that the mou∣res of thys
londe fonde vs we shold be al dede   Thenne sayd Parys make your self
al redy  for thys nyght at mydnyght I


      

shal come  And after thys Pa∣rys retorned to hys lodgyng & dyd do make
redy moche vytayll and the best wynes that he coude gete & he with the
freres maad prouysyon of alle other thynges and mantellys and towellys 

WHan al was redy parys wente to the kepars of the pryson and sayd  I
thanke you many tymes of the playsyrs that ye haue doon to me  I wyl
now departe fro hens for to retorne to my lord the soul¦dan  but for
your loue I wyl soupe wyth you thys nyght and praye yow that we may
soupe to gyder  & they ansuerd that it wel pleased them for his loue
Thenne Parys sente for the vy∣tayll & for the wyn  and after it was
come  they souped to gy∣der  And the kepars which had not been
accustomed to drynke wyn  dranke so moche that they alle were dronke 
& Incontynent l••yed them doun to slepe  & slepte so faste  that for noo thyng they
coude not awake them  & whan parys sawe that  he sayd to the freres 
that they shold vnfeter the doulphyn  & that they shold opene the yates
of the pryson  & yf ony of the kepars awake I shal slee hym  Thenne
the fre∣res began to vnfetere the doul∣phyn wyth grete drede  prayeng
god to be theyr ayde and helpe  And whan the doulphyn was loos he
cladde hym lyke a moure After Parys slewe alle the ke∣pars one after
another by cause yf they awoke they shold not come after them 

THys doon  the doulphyn wyth parys and his var¦let  and the two freres
camen to the porte  and hastely entred in to the fuste which was al
redy  and wonde vp theyr saylle  and by the helpe of god began so fast
to saylle that wyth in fewe dayes they arryueden in a place that thenne
was crysten and there the doulphyn wente a londe by cause he was moche
greued and annoyed as wel of the see  as for the harme that he had
suffred in pryson  and there borowed money  and fro thens came in to
cypres  where was a kyng whyche had dwellyd in the courte of the kyng
of fraunce The whiche as sone as he knewe that the doulphyn of vyennoys
was come  he went to mete hym and prayed hym that he wold come and
lodge in hys paleys  And the doulphyn wente thy∣der  wherof the kyng
had grete Ioye  & there he made hym grete chyere  for many tymes they
had seen eche other in y^e kynges court of Fraunce  and after the kyng
demaunded hym of his aduen∣ture  & the doulphyn recounted


      

it to hym al alonge  and bycause of the comyng of the doulphyn he made
moche grete feste  and re¦ceyued hym moche hyely  and made hym to
soiourne there as longe as it playsed hym  And whan the doulphyn had
sojour∣ned there at his playsyr  he took leue of the kyng and of al hys
courte  thankyng hym moche of the grete playsyr y^t he had doon to
hym  The kyng seyng that the doulphyn wold departe  he gaf to hym
grete yeftes  and dyd do arme two galleyes whyche ac∣companyed hym 
and brought hym vpon the see  and had soo good wynde that in fewe dayes
after they brought hym in to ay∣gues mortes 

WHan the doulphyn was arryued  the knyghtes of the doulphyne herde it
anone  and forthwyth maad them redy & went to horsback & mette wyth hym
at aygues mor¦tes  & there receyued hym in grete honour  & so came
forth the ryʒt waye to vyenne  and for Ioye of hys comyng  al they of
the cyte made a moche noble and mer∣uayllous feste  whyche endured wel
fyftene dayes  & the play∣syr & Ioye was so grete emonge them by cause
they had recou∣uerd theyr lord  that noo man shold and coude haue
thought it  Parys in alle this wyse ne∣uer chaunged hys vesture ne
clo¦thyng but contynuelly wente to masse  and by the commaunde∣ment of
the doulphyn the people dyd hym grete reuerence & ho∣nour  so moche
that parys was ashamed therof  and spake noo thynge but mouryske  And
he had a grete berde  and made to noo pers••ne of the world ony knowleche  and after a whyle of tyme  the doulphyn
for tac∣complysshe that he had promysed to parys by the frere  dyd do
say to parys and do demaunde yf he wold haue the seygnourye of hys londe
and contree  For he was al redy for taccomplysshe that  whyche he had
promysed  And Parys made to hym an∣suer  that he shold kepe stylle hys
londe  Thenne the doulphyn dyd do demaūde hym yf he wold haue hys
doughter vyenne  and parys made the frere to say ye  for that pleased
hym wel  And thenne they wente to hyr  Thenne whan they were to∣fore
Vyenne the frere spake first Madame ye knowe wel that my lord your fader
hath ben a grete whyle in pryson  and yet shold haue been  ne had haue
been  thys moure  whyche hath saued hym  puttyng hys persone in ryght
grete peryl and daun∣ger for the loue of my lord your fader  And thus
ye may wel


      

knowe how moche he is holden to hym  & by cause herof your fa¦der is
subget to hym euer  wher∣fore your fader prayeth you that vpon al the
playsyr that ye wyl doo for hym  that ye wyll take hym for your
husbond  And he shal pardonne all the desplaysyr that euer ye dyd to
hym  whan the frere had fynysshed his wor¦des  vyenne ansuerd to hym
say∣eng  The bysshop of saynt lau∣rence knoweth wel that is here
present that it is longe syth that yf I ••••old haue be maryed  I myght haue ben maryed wyth more honour vnto my
fader  than vnto this moure  for the sone of the duc of borgoyne had
espou∣sed me yf I wold haue consented but god hath put me in suche a
maladye  that I may not longe lyue in this world  & euery day my
maladye encreaceth & so en∣payreth me that I am half roten wherfor I
praye you to say to my fader that he holde me excused  for at thys tyme
I wyl not be maryed  Thenne they took theyr leue of vyenne & recounted
alle thys to the doulphyn  Thēne the doulphyn sayd to the frere that he
shold say it to the moure  & so the frere tolde it al to parys  and
thenne parys which was aferde to lese the loue of vyenne  wente for to
see hyr in the pryson with the frere & the bysshop of saynt laurence 
Thenne whan Parys sawe vyenne in that dysposycy∣on  he had moche grete
sorowe & grete merueylle  and thenne he made the frere to salewe hyr in
hys name  and vyenne ansuerd vnto hys gretyng ryght curtoys¦ly  & the
frere sayd in the name of parys  Madame ye knowe wel I haue delyuerd
your fader oute of pryson  wherof ye ought to haue synguler playsyr  &
yet he shold haue been there yf I had not haue been and holpen hym
oute  & he pardonneth you with good hert and good wylle alle the
desplaysyrs that euer ye dyd ageynst hys playsyr  And prayeth you that
ye take me for your husbond  and wyll that we haue the lordshyp of the
doulphyne  and therfor I praye you  that neyther ye nor I lose not
thys honour  And yet more though thys were not  ye ought not to
dysobeye the com∣maundementes of your fader  And thenne vyenne ansuerd
to the frere as to the persone of Parys sayeng  I knowe well that ye
haue delyuerd my fader oute of pryson  Not wythston∣dyng my fader shal
haue suche regarde ageynst you that ye shal lese noo thynge  And I
wote wel that ye be a man of grete lygnage  & are thorthy to haue a
gretter lady than I am  But the bysshop of seynt Lau∣rence whyche is
present knoweth


      

wel that for the maladye that I am in  I may not longe lyue  & thēne
sayd the frere in his name this is by cause I am a moure that ye refuse
me  I promyse you that I shal become crysten  but I thynke wel that yf
ye kne∣we who that I am  and what I haue lefte for to brynge your
fa¦der oute of pryson  that ye wold preyse me more than ye doo  knowe
ye for certeyn that your fader shal be pariured  for he hath promysed
that ye shal be my wyf wherof ye shal haue blame  ther¦fore yf it
playse you graunte ye hym hys wylle  Thenne sayd vy¦enne  lord I haue
herd say mo∣che good of you  & that ye be he that haue doon so moche
for my fader  but neuertheles in the ma¦ladye in the whyche I am  none
ought to counceyl me to take an husbond  For my lyf may not longe
endure  and by cause that ye may knowe that I say trouth approche ye
ner to me  & ye shal fele and smelle in what dysposy¦cyon I am of my
persone  And thenne they approuched ner to hyr  and vyenne had put two
quarters of an henne vnder hyr two arme hooles  and there ys∣sued so
grete stenche that the bys¦shop ne the frere myght not suf∣fre it 
Neuertheles the▪ stynche was to parys a good odour  for he smellyd it
not & sayd I wote not what ye smelle  for I fele none euyl sauour  And
they meruaylled strongely  by cause he felte not the odour  And the
frere sayd in parys name  For this odour shal I neuer leue you & I
assure you I shal neuer de∣parte fro hens vntyl ye haue con¦sented to
that your fader wyl  and vyenne answerd moche an¦grely & sayd by the
fayth that I owe to god I shal rather rēne wyth my hede ayenst the wa••••e that I shal make my brayn ys∣sue oute of my mouth  & so shal ye be
the occasyon of my dethe  Thēne sayd the frere ye shal not so doo
madame  For I promyse you fro hens forth  that I shal neuer speke more
to you  sythe that it is not your wylle ne ple∣syr  but atte leste of
one thyng I praye you  that this nyght ye ad∣uyse you  and I shal
retorne to morn for to haue of you an an∣suer  and ye shal take
counceyll of your felowe  and I praye to god that ye may be wel
coun∣ceylled  and alle these thynges sayd the frere in the name of
pa¦rys to vyenne  And after they took theyr leue of vyenne  and sayd
alle to the doulphyn  whe¦rof he was thenne moche dysple∣ased  and bad
the frere to telle it alle vnto Parys for to excuse hym  and that he
shold not leye the blame on hym  And whan they were departed fro
vy¦enne  she sayd to ysabeau  My


      

fayr suster  what semeth you of the wysedom of my fader  that thynketh
that I shold take thys moure to my husbond  and haue refused the sone
of the Duke of bourgoyne  but god forbede that euer in my lyf I haue
other lord than Parys to myn husbond  whome I hope yet to haue  &
ysa¦beau sayd  Certes Madame I wote not what to say of your fa¦der
whyche wold gyue you to a moure in maryage  I haue therof grete
thought  for he hath sayd that he shal retorne to morn to see you  and
hath sayd that ye shold remembre and aduyse you 


        How Parys came to see vy∣enne in the pryson  and how she knewe
        hym 

ANd on the morn bety∣mes Parys cladde hym moche more rychely than he had
be accustomed  & gyrde wyth a moche ryche swerde  and came to the
pryson with the frere and the frere sayd to hyr  Ma∣dame we been
retorned for to knowe your good answer  and your entencyon  And vyenne
ansuerd  lordes myn entencyon is that I shal neuer breke my promesse
that I haue made  For I haue auowed that I shal ne∣uer take husbond 
ne goo oute of this pryson  but dede sauf hym to whome I haue
promysed  and therfore retorne ye in good tyme Thenne sayd the frere 
by my fayth I wote not what to say  for it is grete dommage that ye
suffre so moche sorowe & payne  and syth it is thus your wylle & that
ye wyl none otherwyse do  Neuertheles the moure pray¦eth you  that it
may playse you to do to hym so moche grace  that syth ye wyl not take
hym in ma¦ryage  that ye wyl were thys rynge for the loue of hym  Now
thys rynge was the same rynge that vyenne gaf to parys whan he departed
fro hyr in the hows of the chappelayn  and vyenne by cause they shold
nomore come ageyn took the rynge  & whan she had receyued the rynge 
pa∣rys sayd to the frere  I praye you that ye tarye a lytel wyth∣oute 
For I wyl see what coun∣tenaunce she wyl make of the rynge  and the
frere sayd glad∣ly  Neuertheles he meruaylled moche  and Incontynent
the frere wente onte  and vyenne began to beholde the rynge  and whan
parys sawe that vyenne byhelde the rynge so strongely  he began to
speke in hys playne tongue  and sayd  O moche noble lady why be ye so
moche admeruayled of that rynge  Thenne sayd vy∣enne  Certes to my
semyng I sawe neuer a fayrer  Thenne sayd parys  Therfore I praye


      

you that ye take therin playsyr for the more that ye byholde it the more
ye shal prayse it 

WHan Vyenne herde the moure thus speke  thēne she was more
admeruay¦lled than tofo••••  and was as a persone al abasshed and sayd  Alas am I enchaunted  &
what is thys that I see and here speke And in sayeng these wordes she
wold haue fledde for fere oute of the pryson  by cause she herde the
moure so speke  thenne sayd parys  O moche noble lady vy∣enne 
meruaylle ye noo thynge  ne haue ye noo doubte  lo here is parys your
true seruaunte  and vyenne was thēne abasshed more than tofore  Certes
sayd she this may not be but by werke en∣chaunted  & parys sayd  Noble
lady hit is none enchaunted werke  For I am your seruaunt parys whyche
lefte you with y∣sabeau in suche a chyrche  & there ye gaf to me the
dyamond whi∣che now I haue delyuerd to you and there ye promysed to me
that ye wold neuer take husbond but me  and be ye noo thynge
admeruaylled of the berde ne of the vesture that I were  for they take
awaye the knowleche of me  & many other wordes sayd parys to vyenne 
by whyche she knewe clerely that he was parys and for the souerayn loue
that she bare to hym  & for the grete Ioye that she had  she began to
wepe in hys armes  and tem∣brace and kysse hym moche swe∣tely  and
there they comforted eche other wyth swete wordes  & so abode longe
tyme  vyēne coude not ynough kysse hym & enbrace hym  and also parys
demaun∣ded of hyr of hyr aduenture  & she tolde hym alle  And of alle
thys ysabeau had nothyng herde of  for she was faste a slepe by cause
she had watched alle the nyght byfore  and for the grete Ioye and
swetenes that parys & vyēne demeaned bytwene them she awoke  and whan
she sawe vyenne beyng enbraced with the moure she sayd  Madame what is
thys that ye do  haue ye loste your wytte  that so enbrace this
moure  hath he enchaunted you that ye suffre hym soo famylyer wyth
you  and is this the fayth that ye kepe to parys  for whom ye haue
suffred so moche payne & sorowe  and vyenne sayd  Swete suster say ye
noo suche wordes  but come & take your parte of the solace that I
haue  for also wel haue ye founden good ad∣uenture as I haue  See ye
not here my swete parys  whome so moche we haue desyred  Thenne
ysabeau approched ner to hym & byhelde hym wel and sawe that it was
parys  and she wente & kyssed hym  & demened so moche


      

grete Ioye bytwene them thre  that there is noo persone in the world
that myght say ne thynke it  but so abode a grete whyle in thys soulas
and Ioye  tyl atte laste parys spack  Swete vy∣enne it byhoueth that
we goo hens tofore my lord the dolphyn your fader  For now fro hens
forth it is necessarye that he kno∣we alle our fayte  Neuertheles I
praye you to say nothyng  tyl I desyre you  and al thre came oute of
the pryson  and sonde the frere whyche meruaylled gretely and alle they
to gydre wente to the doulphyn  whyche had soue¦rayn playsyr whan he
saw them And neuertheles he was moche abusshed how his doughter was so
come  and thenne parys sayd to the frere  Say ye to the doul¦phyn that
I haue conuerted hys doughter to hys wylle and to myn  & that it playse
hym that she be my wyf  & the frere sayd soo  Thenne the doulphyn sayd
to hys doughter  wyl ye take thys man for your husbond  whyche hath
delyuerd me oute of pryson in grete peryl of hys persone  Thenne
demaunded vy∣enne of Parys yf he wold that she shold speke  and parys
sayd ye  And thenne Vyenne sayd to the doulphyn  My fader I am redy to
do your commaundement and hys  and praye you to par∣donne me & to gyue
to me your benedyctyon  and whan she sayd thus  hyr fader pardonned
hyr and gaf to hyr hys blessyng & kyssed hyr  Thenne sayd vyenne loo
here is my good frende Pa∣rys whome I haue so moche desy¦red  and for
whome I haue suffred so moche payne & sorowe and fader thys is he that
so swe¦tely songe and floyted  and that wanne the Ioustes in thys
cyte  and bare with hym the shelde of crystal and my garlonde  & also
thys is he that wanne the Ious∣tes in the cyte of paris and wan there
the thre baners wyth the iij Iewellys  and went awaye with them
wythoute knowyng of o∣ny man  And also he hath dely∣uerd you out of
pryson puttyng hys lyf in Ieopardye for you  and whan the doulphyn
vnder∣stood al thys he was meruayl∣lously glad and Ioyous  After al
thys parys went to his fa∣der  & whan he sawe hym and knewe that he was
hys sone pa∣rys  whome he had so longe de∣syred to see  he enbraced
hym & kyssed hym  & for the Ioye that he had he coude not speke a word
and after alle the other lordes & knyghtes ranne for tembrace & kysse
hym  and after this Ioye Parys fader sayd to the doul∣phyn  My lord
playse it you that I may borowe my sone home to my hous for to see his
moder and hys felowe Edward 


      

Thenne sayd the doulphyn it playseth me ryght wel onely for thys day 
For to morn I wyl that the maryage of hym & my doughter be made &
solempnysed here  And thenne messyre Ia∣ques wente with hys sone vnto
hys hous  And whan he was there  verayly his fader  his mo¦der  and
hys felowe Edward wyst not where they were for Ioye and playsyr that
they had and that was noo wonder  for they had no moo chyldren but
hym  and he shold wedde the doughter of their lord  and also Parys was
in that tyme become a valyaunte knyght  and ful of al beaulte  and for
many rea∣sons it was no meruayll though they had in hym grete Ioye and
playsyr  & Edward demaun∣ded of hym of hys aduenture  & many other
thynges  And he recounted and tolde hym alle 


        How Parys espoused and wedded vyenne  and of the feste that
        was there made 

THenne on the morn the dolphyn gaf his dough∣ter in maryage to parys And
the feste was moche noble and sumptuous  For moche pe∣ple were comen
thyder for to see the feste  and it endured fyftene dayes  And the
playsyr and so¦lace whyche was doon for the loue of Parys and of vyenne
was soo grete  that vnnethe it may be byleued  whyche parys and Vyenne
lyued to gyder a grete whyle in ryght grete conso¦lacyon and playsyr 
but after thaccomplysshement of the mary¦age  the fader and moder of
pa∣rys lyueden not longe after in thys world  and Parys had by Vyenne
hys wyf thre chyldren  that is to wete two sones & one d••ughter  
And the doulphyn or¦deyned for them moche noble ma¦trymonye 
And parys after the deth of hys fader and his moder wold that Edward hys
dere fe¦lowe shold be herytyer of al the goodes that hys fader lefte and
gaf to hym ysabeau to hys wyf  whyche lyued to gyder longe tyme in
grete loue and concorde  And sone after the doulphyn & hys wyf
deyeden  And thenne was Parys doulyhyn and had the possessyon of al the
seygnou∣rye  the whyche lyued wyth vy∣enne in thys world fourty yere
and ledde a good and holy lyf  in so moche that after thentende∣ment of
somme men they be sayn¦tes in heuen  & they deyed bothe in one yere 
And semblably Ed¦ward and ysabeau deyed bothe tweyne in one yere 
Therfore late vs praye vnto our lord that we may doo suche werkes in
this world  that in suche wyse we


      

may accompanye them in the per¦durable glorye of heuen Amen

 Now þese chapitles of þis book ben y-ordeyned, I wole
fulfille my purpos pursuynge ech chapitle bi ordre, & confermynge my
wordis aftir þe auctorite of myn auctouris and wiþ experiment þat I haue
longe tyme vsed wiþ þe help of god.   

Al þing þat we wolde knowe, bi oon of .iij. maners þat we moun knowe,
eiþir bi his name, or by his worchinge, or bi his verri beynge schewynge
propirte of him-silf  In þis þre maner we moun knowe surgerie bi
expownynge of his name; for siurge comeþ of siros, þat is a word of gru,
& in englisch siros is an hand, & gyros gru, þat is worchinge in
englisch  For þe ende & þe profite of syurgie is   soþfastnes of a
þing, bisie him nouȝt to knowe þe name of a þing, but þe worchinge & þe
effete of þe same þing  Therfore he þat wole knowe what siurgie is, he
moot vndirstonde, þat it is a medicinal science, which techiþ us to
worche wiþ handis in mannes bodi, wiþ kuttynge or openynge þe


      

parties þat ben hole & in helynge þo þat ben broken, or kutt, as þei
were toforn,  or ellis as nyȝ as a man may, & also in doynge
awey þat is to myche skyn: as wertis or wennys, or þe fleisch to hiȝe 

 Þe secunde chapitle of Þe firste tretis is of Þe qualitees, maners,
and kunnynge of a surgian 

Nedeful it is þat a surgian be of a complexcioun weel proporciound, and
þat his complexcioun be temperat  Races seiþ, who-so is nouȝt semelich,
is ympossible to haue good maners  but
folowen þe lijknes of an yuele complexioun A surgian muste haue handis
weel schape, longe smale fyngris, and his body not quakynge, & al must
ben of sutil witt, for al þing þat longiþ to siurgie may not wiþ lettris
ben writen. He muste studie in alle þe parties of philofie & in logik,
þat he mowe vndirstonde scripturis; in gramer, þat he speke congruliche;
in  arte, þat techiþ him to proue his
proporciouns wiþ good resoun; in retorik þat techiþ him to speke
semelich. Be he no glotoun, ne noon enuyous, ne a negard; be he trewe,
vnbeliche,  & plesyngliche bere he
him-silf to hise pacientis; speke he noon ribawdrie in þe sike mannis
 hous 


      

ȝeue he no counseil, but if he be axid; ne speke he wiþ no womman in
folie in þe sik mannes hous; ne chide not wiþ þe sike man ne wiþ noon of
hise meyne, but curteisli speke to þe sijk man, and in almaner sijknes
bihote him heele, þouȝ þou be of him dispeirid; but neuer þe lattere
seie to hise freendis þe caas as it stant  Loue he noon harde curis, &
entermete he nouȝt of þo þat ben in dispeir. Pore men helpe he bi his
myȝt, and of þe riche men axe he good reward  Preise he nouȝt him-silf
wiþ his owne mouþ, ne blame he nouȝt scharpliche oþere lechis; loue he
alle lechis & clerkis, & bi his myȝt  make he no leche
his enemye. So cloþe he him wiþ vertues, þat of him mai arise good fame
& name; & þis techiþ etik. So lerne he fisik, þat he mowe wiþ good rulis
his surgerie defende & þat techiþ fisik  Neþeles it is nessessarie a
surgian to knowe alle þe parties and ech sengle partie of a medicyn. For
if a surgian ne knewe nouȝt þe science of elementis, whiche þat ben
firstmoost force of natural þingis & of dyuers lymes, he mai not  knowe science of coniouncions, þat is to seie, medlyngis &
complexiouns þat ben nessessarie to his craft  A surgian muste knowe
þat alle bodies þat ben medlid vndir þe sercle of þe moone, ben
engendrid of foure


      

symple bodies, her lijknes ech in oþere medlynge; þat is to seie: fier &
watir, erþe & eir: þese  elementis for þe vttirmeste
eende, & þe vttermeste contrariouste of here qualitees were fer drawen
from bodilich lijf; but whanne her qualitees, þat is to seie, maner of

so complexioun is nyȝ brouȝt to a mele; & so þat þat is medlid is more
able to resceiue þe noble foorme of lijf, þe which nobilite aboue alle

þat wiþ þo bodies of elementis  comen into medlynge, & it is
vnpossible to departe þo qualitees from bodies þat ben foure: hoot,
coold, moist & drie, & complexiouns ben bi hem, it is nessessarie to

þing ellis but a maner qualite medlid in worchinge & suffrynge of
contrarious qualitees þat ben founden in elementis, so þat þe leeste

Neuereþelatter among alle þe complexiouns þat man mai fynde, þat is

nouȝt, so þat mannes complexioun may not conseyue wheþer it coldiþ him,
heetiþ or drieþ or moistiþ him: it is clepid temperat  & þilke þing þat
we seie is hoot in þe firste degree, þat is I-heet of kyndely heete þat

þilke we seie to be hoot in þe þridde degree, which þat is het of  kyndely heete bryngiþ to oure bodi sensible greuaunce. &
þilke is in þe fourþe degree, þat is hot of 
vnkyndely heete, distroieþ þe bodi openliche  & in þis same maner ȝe
moun knowe degrees þat ben colde  I mai preue in þis maner, þat it is
nessessarie a surgian to knowe complexiouns of bodies, lymes, & of

a swerd or a knyf  þwert ouer þe arm in oon hour & in

þat oþer of a cold complexioun & a drie. Þe comoun seiynge of lewid men
is þat þei schulden boþe ben helid on o maner; but resonable surgerie I-
preued techiþ us, þat þei ne schulde not boþe be helid aftir oon maner 
For he þat haþ an hoot complexioun, & a moist, may liȝtly haue an hoot
enpostym—þat is an hoot swellynge—& þat may be cause of an hoot feuere.
What schalt þou þanne do? þou must loke, wheþer he haþ bled myche blood
at his wounde, and þanne it is weel; ellis lete him blood of þe
contrarious arme, or ellis—of þe oon same side, if strenkþe & age
acorde; or ventose  him on þe two buttokkis, if þat he be feble. & if he may not
schite  oones a day, helpe him


      

þerto, or with clisterie, or wiþ suppositorie. & brynge þou þe parties
of þe wounde togidere þoruȝ sowynge, or wiþ plumaciols—þat ben smale
pelewis—or wiþ byndynge, if þat sewynge be nouȝt nessessarie, & þanne
worche aboute þe wounde, as it is told aftir in þe book. But aboute þe
wounde leie a medicyn defensif, of bole armonyac  , oile of rosis, & a litil vynegre; so þat  þe
medicyn touche þe brynkis of þe wounde, þat humouris moun not haue her
cours to renne to þe wounde; & we forbeden him wiyn, mylk & eiren &
fisch þat engendriþ myche blood  But he schal ete for his mete growel
maad of otemele, eiþir of barli mele wiþ almaundis; & generaliche he
schal vse a streit dietynge, til þat he be sikir þat he schal haue noon
hote enpostym. & if þat we kunne fende him fro a feuere & apostym, þe
science of his complexioun techiþ us, þat he may of his sijknes soone be
hool  þe oþere of þe cold complexioun schal not be leten blood ne
ventusid, for blood schulde be kept in him, as for tresour  Forbede hem
neiþir wiyn ne fleisch, for þe stomak þat is so feble ne myȝte nouȝt
engendre nessessarie mater of blood þat longiþ to þe wounde  Ne we

corrodith it; and neþeles vitriol haþ but oon maner worchinge, þouȝ þat
he worche dyuersliche in dyuers complexiouns  Riȝt as þe worchinge of
þe sunne is dyuers, nouȝt for þe sunne, but for þe worchinge of dyuers
bodies into whom he worchiþ  Vitriol drieþ wondirfulliche myche: in
drie bodies he defendiþ  þe

wherfore he may nouȝt but drie þe superfluytees þat he fyndiþ in þe

strenkþe of þe vitriol, þe fleisch meltiþ vndir it, & so bi vitriol þe

 Iohannes damascenus seiþ, Medicyns & enplastris schulden ben

schal be kept wiþ a þing þat is kyndly þerto  And þat is aȝen kynde
schal be doon awei with þing þat is contrarie þerto  If þat a surgian
knew not complexiouns of lymes & of bodies, he schal nouȝt conne to
schewynge hise medicyns aftir þat kynde askiþ. A surgian must knowe
generacioun of humouris, if he wolde knowe þe science & þe helynge of
apostymes, as it schal be declarid in þe tretis of apostymes. He muste
knowe þe dyuersitees & þe profitis & þe officis of lymes, þat he mowe
knowe, what lymes han a greet worchinge in mannes body, & whiche ben of
greet felynge, & whiche moun bere a strong medicyn  & þe vertues of
lymes þou must knowe, þat he se, whanne þe worchinge of ony vartu failiþ

haue þe science of knowynge of vertues, þe science of spiritis schal
nouȝt be hid fro him. Alle þese þingis bifore seid ben but natureles, &
þei  ben but techinge of medicyns speculatijf 

Also he muste haue knoulechinge of þingis þat ben not naturels, þat he
kunne chese good eir to him þat is woundid or ellis haþ


      

a boch   Woundis
moun not be  dried in a moist eir & a vapouris, but
þei þat ben woundid musten ben chaungid fro þat moist eir to a swete
cleer eyr & a drie  In wyntir he muste kepe him fro cold; for no þing
greueþ so myche boones & senewis as cold 
þat ben I-woundid  & in somer he muste haue temperable eir. It is
nessessarie þat he kunne dietyn his pacient, as I schal telle in þe same
chapitle of dietinge  also he muste ordeyne meuynge & reste,  as it nediþ to þe same sijk man  for if þat he
be woundid in þe heed eiþer haue ony puncture of ony senewe, it is
nessessarie þat he reste & dwelle in stillenes & haue an esy bed & a
soft; lest he suffre ony traueile of his lymes  But if þat olde woundis
wiþout akynge weren in his armes, it were good to him, þat is sijk, to
walke on his feet, & lete his arme be bounde to his necke; & if þat þe
wounde be in hise schynes & in hise feet, it were good þat he lay &
traueilide wiþ hise hondis  Also a  surgian, in al þat he

engenderiþ superfluyte & febliþ his vertewes, & coldiþ & lesiþ al his

He muste knowe þe sijknes: as olde wounde, festre, cankre & alle oþere

For ech dyuers soor nediþ dyuers helpingis. He muste knowe þe cause of

heelid, þan he þat is biten with a wood hound; as þou schalt fynde soone

a þing þat falliþ to a wounde out of kynde as hoot, cold, drie, eiþer to

Laxatiues & vometis ben nedeful to hem, þat han olde rotid woundis &

it is nessessarie a surgian to knowe phisik, & oþer dyuers science, as I

 þe .iij c^o . of þe firste techinge is of intencioun of a surgian

þat ben in þe templis & þe forheed & maken cauterizaciouns for þe

 þe firste chapitle of þe secunde tretis is an vniuersal word of smale
lymes & her helpingis, & of generacioun of embrioun, þat is þe child, in
þe modir wombe    

Galienus seiþ, þat it is nessessarie a surgian to knowe anotamie; ne
leeue we nouȝt þat ech brood ligament is a skyn, & ech round ligament to
be a senewe, so bi his opinyoun he myȝte falle into errour  Þerfore I
þenke to ordeyne a chapitle of þe kynde & of the  foorme &
helpinge of alle smale lymes  Auicen seiþ  knoulechinge of a þing, þat
haþ cause, mai nouȝt be knowen, but bi his cause. Þerfore we moten knowe
þe cause, membriorum consimilium, þat is to seie, smale lymes. & I wole
telle þe generacioun of embrioun: þat is to seie, how a child is I-gete
in þe modir wombe  Galion & auicen tellen, þat of boþe þe spermes of
man & of womman, worchinge & suffrynge togideris, so þat ech of hem
worche in oþir & suffre in oþir, embrioun is bigete  But the worchinge
of mannes kynde is more myȝtiere, & wommans kynde


      

more febler  For riȝt as þe roundeles  of chese haþ bi him-silf wei of worchinge & þe
mylk bi wey of suffrynge, so to þe generacioun of embrion mannes sperme
haþ him  bi wei
of worchinge & wommans sperme bi wey of suffrynge  & riȝt as þe
rundelis  & þe

of embrioun. Þouȝ þat alle þe smale lymes of a child ben I-geten of boþe
two spermes, neþeles, to cloþe hem with fleisch & wiþ fatnes, comeþ to

aldai engendrid in us, may weel & verriliche be restorid  Þese smale
lymes han dyuers foormes, complexciouns & helpingis aftir þe dyuersitees
of þe proporciouns of þe mater, which þat þei ben maad of  for þouȝ þat
alle þe lymes ben maad of oon mater I-medlid, neþeles in ech of þe smale

Þe boon is þe first of þe consimile membris—þat is oon of þe smale
lymes; þe which ben  cold & drie & he haþ dyuers
foormes in mannes bodi: for he helpiþ dyuerslich  þe cause whi þer ben
manye dyuers boones in mannes bodi is, for sumtyme it is nede to meeue
oon lyme withouten anoþir & þat were impossible, if þat al þe bodi were
but oon boon  Anoþer cause whi þer ben manye boones: for summe defenden
þe principal lymes from harm, as þe brayn scolle from  þe brayn of þe heed  summe ben foundementis, as þe boones of
þe rigge & of þe schenes & of þe armes  summe ben as additamentis þat

At þe laste is þe skyn þat is temperat in al her qualitees; & it is maad
of smale þredis of veynes, senewis, & arteries, þat makiþ him censible,
& ȝeueþ him liȝf & worchinge, þat ben gouernouris of al þe bodi. & þe
skyn is maad temperat, for he schulde knowe hoot, coold, moist, & drie,
soft, hard, scharp, & smoþe  & if þat þe skyn were as sencible as a

of þe fyngris endis þe whiche þat is more temperat þan ony oþir skyn of

Brawnes þouȝ þat þei be maad of mater medlid, neþeles þei ben rekened
among membris consimiles, for þei comen to þe making of membris
officials  Brawn is maad of fleisch, senewe, & ligamentis, & þei ben
instrument voluntarie meuynge. Þe senewe þat comeþ fro þe brayn & þe
nucha, & goiþ forþ to meue þe lymes, is medlid wiþ a ligament  & whanne
þe senewe & þe ligament ben medlid togidere, it is clepid a corda  & þe
corde is maad for þre skilis. þe firste  for a
symple sinewe is to censible ; þe senewe bi him-silf myȝt not
suffre gret traueile & meuynge, but þe felowschipe of þe ligament þat is
incensible lettiþ þe felynge of þe senewe, & bringiþ him to a profitable
temperaunce  Þe senewe haþ .ij. oþere defautis: neischenesse and
liȝtnesse. But þo .ij. defautis þe medlynge of þe ligament fulfilliþ
 ; for þe neischenes is temperid & strenkþid, & þe
litilnes is maad more. Þe neischnes comeþ of þe brayn for it is myche, &
þe litilnes comeþ of þe nucha, for it is litil. Þat þat is maad of þis
nerf & þis ligament is clepid a corde; þe which þat meueþ þe lymes to þe

ouþer drawen after þat þe lyme bouwiþ. To þis  corde, þer is asocied a symple

Þe brawn is maad bowynge as a bowe þat is bent; & for þe kynde wolde

þe corde whanne he entriþ into þe brawn is departid into many smale

at þe eendis of þe brawn þilke þredis ben gaderid togidere to make a

whiche þat ben instrumentes to resonable soule. And in þe ij. tretis I
wole telle þe anotamie of lymes of office.


      

The firste chapitle 

 Þe .iij. techinge is of difference of woundis & of general curis  We
schulen undrestonde þat wounde, & old wounde, festre & cankre woundid, &

vndoynge of þat þat is hool. & alle þese sijknessis, & many oon oþir as
weel, moun falle to consimile membris as to official membris  vulnus is
a newe wounde  vlcus is an old rotid wounde.  I schal tellen
in her placis þe difference of festre & cankre & apostyme; plage
comounly is taken for an oold wounde, & ofte tymes we fynde þat an old
wounde is clepid vulnus, as ypocras seiþ  vulnera anua necesse est in
eis os taliefieri  & cicatrices concauas fieri: þat is
to seie, it is nedful  þat þe boon in an oold
wounde to be rotid & þe cicatrices to be holowȝ  Cicatrice is þe place
of þe schynboon  þe wounde,
whanne þat it is hool  Summe woundis ben symple, & summe compound  in
two maner he is clepid a symple wounde  oon maner, for he haþ not lost

symple  but boþe symple & compoundis sumtyme is in þe fleisch or


      

in þe senewe, or in þe boon, or in þe veynes, or in þe arterie  also
þese woundis han dyuers cause. Summe comen fro wiþinne of þe malice,
eiþer of to greet multitude of humouris.  oþirwhile tobrekiþ þe membre & wiþholdiþ & woundiþ him  Cold

if þat membris of office ben kutt of, þei moun neuere be restorid, ne
noon of þe consimile membris mai be restorid, if he be doon awey: as
boonis, pelliculis, gristlis, ligamentis & skyn  For þe cause of her
generacioun is þe sperme of þe fadir & of þe modir, as I tolde tofore 
but in place of þing þat is I-lore, kynde restoriþ þat, þat is moost
conuenient to þe place; but fleisch mai be restorid bi cause


      

þat þe blood is engendrid al day in us, & þe blood is þe mater of þe

þei moun  ben consoudid, & þe veynes

þe secunde chapitle of þe þridde techinge 

Now we wolen trete of a wounde maad in fleisch. We wolen bigynne at a
symple wounde maad wiþ knyf or wiþ swerd, or spere or arowe, or wiþ ony
oþir þing semblablele to hem.


      

Bynde togideris þilke wounde with a boond þat closiþ þe wounde
togideris, & kepe þilke wounde from swellynge wiþ þe whiȝt of an ey leid
aboue þe wounde, & lete þe wounde be in reste; & þer nediþ noon oþer

prickid vndir þe wounde, eiþer a pannicle þat is bitwene þe fleisch and
þe boon; & þanne þer is anoþer cure, as I schal telle in þe chapitle of
puncture of a senewe. þat  I haue heelid a man
þat was  smyte wiþ a spere þoruȝ þe fleisch
of þe buttoke, bi þe lenkþe of a fote,  but þilke wounde
touchide no senewe, & þat I wiste sikirliche, for he hadde noon akynge 
I heeld þe wounde open aldai wiþ a litil smal tent & a schort, þat I
myȝte wite, if þat he schulde aken on þe morowe, & I comaundide him to
reste  & on þe morowe I foond noon inflacioun ne akynge; & þanne I took
awey þe tent & lete þe wounde closen, & so comaundide I him to reste þe
secunde dai  In þe þridde day he was hool. & if a wounde were maad wiþ
a swerd or wiþ ony þing þat bitiþ in lenkþe, anoon þou must loke if þe

þe wounde togideris, þat it may be weel ioyned, & leie aboue þe wounde a

of frankencense, & of two parties of sandragoun, 
& of þre parties of quyk lym, & lete nouȝt þe poudre entre bitwene in þe

 .iij. cornered
maad of herdis or of towe in þis maner:

& ioyned togidere as it was ioyned arst, or it were kutt  & bynde þe

til .iiij. daies ben goon, but if þat þe wounde ake or be to-swollen. &
þanne bynde þe wounde as it was biforn wiþ þe white of an ey; oile,
poudre, & plumaciols. But if þe wounde were so myche, þat byndynge wolde
nouȝt suffice, or were kutt ouerþwert ouer þe lyme, so þat þe parties of
þe lyme myȝt nouȝt wel be  brouȝt togideris, þanne sowe þe

bitwene þe lippis of þe


      

wounde, & haue a nedle þre cornerid, whos iȝe schal be holid on boþe

þilke þred schal be twyned, & wiþoute knotte, & I-wexid, & þe lippis of
þe wounde schal be sowid togideris; & þe þred schal be knytt wiþ two
knottis in þe firste place, & in þe secunde place wiþ oon knotte; & so
make as manye poyntis, as it is nessessarie, & ech poynt schal be from
oþir bi þe brede of a litil fyngir, & streyne þe wounde with knottynge &
þe sewynge of þe lippis of þe wounde togidere þat he ake sumwhat, but
nouȝt to myche. & if þat þer nede mo poyntis to be þere þan two,
euermore þer schal be odde poyntis. as .iij. v. or .vij. & þe oon poynt
schal be first from þe oon eende of þe wounde, bi þe space of a litil

þridde poynt schal be in þe myddil of þe wounde  & if it be nede to
haue mo poyntis, þanne schalt þou  bigynne at þe myddil
poynt, & make as manye poyntis on boþe sidis as it is nede, til þou come
to boþe eendis  For bi þis maner of sowynge neiþir partie schal be
crokid, & so þe place mai faire be restorid, & euermore take kepe þat
 þe wounde be not depe, þi sowynge schal be nouȝt deep  & if þi
wounde be deep, þi sowynge schal be deep, þat alle þe parties of þe
wounde moun


      

be ioyned  For if þe wounde were deep, & þi sowynge not deep, nede þer
muste be in þe depþe of þe wounde a greet holownes, to þe which holownes
blood & quyttere schulde be cast; & þilke quyttere & blood schulde lette
þe helynge of þe wounde. & þe poudre þat is seid in þe same chapitle,
schal be leid aboue on þe same wounde; & þou schalt kepe þe sewynge & þe
parties of þe wounde þat I brouȝte togidere wiþ plumaciols þre cornerid,
& wiþ alle þe oþere þingis þat ben in þis chapitle tofore seid  And if
þat a wounde haþ be to longe in þe eir open, which þat is þe cause of
quyttere þat lettiþ consolidacioun, þanne we musten clense þe wounde wiþ
þis mundificatif þat is maad of flour of wheete & hony & water & mel
roset,  I-colat, þat is to seie, clensid from þe rosis, and
of barly mele  Of þese mundificatyues þou schalt haue a ful techinge in
þe laste tretis 

But if þe wounde be compound, a leche muste haue as manye intenciouns as
þer ben accidentis to þe wounde  I sette an ensaumple. I suppose þat a
wounde be compound wiþ holownes & lesynge of fleisch & of skyn, & þere
be myche quytter, & also þat þer be apostyme, & þer be a greet akynge;
al þis is clepid a wounde compound  þanne schulen we nouȝt onliche take
hede to consolidacioun of þat wounde: þat is to seie, helynge; but first
we schulen aswage


      

akþe & apostymes, as it schal be teld in þe chapitle of an enpostyme &
of akynge  Aftirward we schulen clense þe quytture, & aftir þat
regenere fleisch, & at þe laste brynge ouer cicatrice. In alle þe
worchingis of medicyns, where þat akþe is, first we schulen aswage akþe,
for aboue al oþir þing strong akynge ouercomeþ myȝt of vertu & strenk
þe  & also resoun telliþ; membris 
þat han akþe, þilke akþe is cause of drawynge from þe oþere placis to þe

humouris ben drawen to lymes þat aken for .ij. causis: o cause, for

þat al þing þat consowdiþ þe wounde greueþ þe wounde, if þat þer be
apostyme wiþ þe wounde  & þe quytture schal be clensid or þou leie ony
regeneratijf to holowȝ woundis. Auicen telliþ þe cause, whi þat yuel
fleisch growiþ in a wounde  If þat a leche wolde bisie him wiþ a

quytture were clensid  & whanne þat þe wounde is clensid, þanne we
schulen fulfille þilke holownes wiþ fleisch or þat þe wounde be


      

heelid, lest perauenture  þat þer dwelle an holownesse vndir þe wounde, whanne þat he is
helid, in whom þat quytture schulde be engendrid, þerwith  ech dai schulde augmente þilke holownesse,
& so we moten be constreyned to opene anoþir tyme þat, þat was heelid
tofore  þou maist fynde in þe chapitle of woundis of senewis, how þou
schalt aswage akþe, & in þe .vj. chapitle of þis techinge þou schalt
fynde þe cure  of a wounde þat haþ a swellynge, & is out of

þou schalt clense quytture & regendre fleisch 

The þridde techinge of þe firste tretis is of heelynge of a wounde maad
in senewe 

Almyȝti god hath ȝeue to senewe greet felyng, & if þat he be hirt, he
suffriþ greet akynge  Galion seiþ: a senewe þat is more selynge þan
anoþer  it is nessessarie þat he haue grettere akþe  Vndirstonde
þat a wounde þat is maad in a senewe, mai not be wiþoute akynge. Ne  woundis þat ben maad in senewis, ouþer þat ben in
lenkþe or in brede  Þe woundis þat ben maad in lenkþe of þe2 senewe,
ben lesse perilous þan  þo þat ben maad in
brede of þe


      

senewe ben moost perilous  Oþerwhile a senewe is kutt al atwo  & þanne
þilke lyme, to whom þat senewe serueþ, lesiþ his meuynge & þe felynge,
þat þilke senewe brouȝte to him from þe brain. & þilke senewe oþirwhile
is not kutt al atwo, but he is I-preickid, & þanne it is perilous lest
þe crampe come for to greet akþe  For akþe entriþ into þe part of þe
senewe þat is kutt or prickid; & bi þe  partie of þe senewe
þat is hool, akþe is brouȝt to þe brayn. & so þe crampe mai come to þe
wounde bi oon of þre weies: þat is to greet akþe, cold, or rotynge. Of
þese þre or of oon bi him-silf mai come a drawinge togidere of a senewe
þat is cause of a crampe  & þat þat is seid of a wounde of a symple
senewe may fallen ofte-tymes in a wounde of a corde & a brawn, &
nameliche of a corde þat is in bigynnynge of a brawn. Þo woundis þat ben
in þese þre consimile membris, þat is  seie senewe, corde, & brawn
han o. drede in cours of þe crampe, & also o. drede of felynge, lesynge
& meuynge  &  þerfore be-war in þe cure of a wounde
maad in senewe, wheþer þat it be a prickynge or þat it be kutt
ouerþwert, or ellis be kutt oonly bi his lenkþe. If oonly he be prickid
þe wounde of þe skyn is hool, & þanne it is clepid a blynde puncture;
eiþer þe wounde is open, & it is clepid an open puncture  In a blind
puncture it is


      

nessessarie to opene þe skyn, & aftirward heelde into þe hoole as hoot
as he mai suffre, hoot oile of rosis swete smellynge, þat is maad of

rosis maad þicke with bool armoniak. & aftir þat leie a lynnen clooþ I-
het aboue, & aftir þat a good quantite of tow I-tosid, & bynde þe lyme

bi whom akþe goiþ to þe brain, & it lettiþ drawynge togidere of þe

þer may be no bettere medicyn. But if þat akþe dure ouer longe, it is
not yuel to putte a litil opium to þe oile of þe rosis & þe bole

if he do ony newe errour  Of þis wounde Ypocras spekiþ: in vulneribus
malis & fortibus sanie non apparante—þat is to seie: in yuel woundis and
strong woundis, if no quytture appere it is yuel  Strong woundis ben
clepid woundis þat sore aken  Yuel woundis ben þo, to whom scharpe
humouris rennen & ben nouȝt obedient to kyndeli heete, to be turned into

þe crampe  For Galion seiþ: þat a senewe is maad of moist mater & a

Galion seiþ in þe eende of his coment: coold is moost greuous to a

& he leide þerto a plastre maturatijf, wherfore al þe hand rotide & he

If þat a senewe hadde ben I-kutt ouerþwert ouer al atwo þanne, þouȝ þat
Tederious  & summe oþere seien þe contrarie, it is good þat

of þe cure of a wounde, whanne þat þer is wiþ him a swellynge. If þat a
wounde were chaungid of þe eyr and made quytture, þat þe sowynge were
to-broke and þe puncture were vndir,  þanne make a medicyne mundificatif & leie him abrood on a lynnen
clooþ & leie it aboue þe wounde, & putte a litil smal tent in þe eende
of þe wounde þat is moost lynynge,  & þilke
tent schal touche no senewe ne make noon akþe vndir 
þat, þat ilke wounde be  weel dried. A mundificatijf medicyn
of senewis woundid is maad in þis maner: Take mel roset colat
 .iij. smal flour of barly & medle hem togidere & boile hem slili
þat þei brenne nouȝt, & remeue hem fro þe fier & bete hem longe togidere
wiþ a spature;  & þanne putte þerto  j. of whit
terebentyne; & if þou mowe finde noon whiȝt terebentyne, þanne waische oþere


      

terebentyne with cold watir til it be whiȝt, & whane þat be þis medicyn
þis wounde is almoost drie, þanne putte in þe same medicyn a litil
poudre of frankencense mastik & saundragoun, medle hem togidere & leie
aboue þe wounde til it be hool  & whanne þat it is hool manye daies
aftir, leie flex in good strong wiyn het hoot til it be perfiȝtli al
hool, & if þat þer leue ony hardnes in meuynge, after þat it is hool,
þanne þou schalt vse þe techinge þat schal be ȝouen to þee in þe laste
tretis þat schal be antidotarie in þe chapitle of medicyns
mollificatyues; þere þou schalt fynde þe maner how þou schalt helpe best
lymes þat ben heelid and moun not riȝt weel meuen 

Þe firste  techinge of þe firste tretis is
of heelynge of a wounde maad in boon 

Whanne þat woundis ben so depe þat  oonly fleisch is not
woundid but þe boon þat is vndir þe fleisch & þe senewe  þanne a man
muste biholde, wher þat þe boon be kutt al atwo, as ofte-tyme it may
happe in þe boon of þe thie & schene boonys & þe boonys of þe armes. And
þanne þilke wounde is ful perilous; & nameli if þe boonys of þe thie
ouþir þe boon of þe arme from þe schuldre to þe elbowe be kutt al atwo,
so þat þe marie go out. But ofte-tymes


      

oon boon of þe schene or o. boon of þe armes is kutt al atwo ouertwert
ouer & neþeles afterward may be restorid; ouþer a boon is not kutt al
atwo but sum of his substaunce is don awey, & þilke substaunce, ouþer he
is doon awey or ellis he hangiþ togidere  A general rule is in cure of
woundis in whom boonys ben woundid: þat neuere bi a leche fleisch schal
ben I-sowdid aboue þe boon, but first pleynerliche bi repeire  ; for þe boon may neuere be  wiþ verri consolidacion be consowdid, for his mater was þe
sperme of þe fadir & of þe modir; but in summe children, for þe age  is
toward ofte tyme þat þei were sperme  but þer schal be maad a maner of
restorynge in place of þe boon þat was broken eiþer lost, þat men clepen
 poris sarcoides or ellis caro poroydes, & a 
maner þing þat is restorid is hardere þan þe fleisch & neischere þan þe
boon  & if þat ilk mater þat is restorid be nyȝ as hard as is þe boon,
it is clepid porus sarcoides  & if þat ilke mater be not hard but
sumwhat neische, it is clepid caro poroydes  & if þat a neische fleisch
were & a moist nouȝt regenered vpon boonys þat ben sett togidere, a man
schulde not haue his purpos to heele & consowde þe wounde. Loke þanne
wheþer þe boon be kutt atwo altogidere ouerþwert ouer, þat


      

þou bryngist togidere & bindist þe parties of þe wounde, as it schal be
told in þe .viij. chapitle folowynge, where þou schalt haue how a wounde
schal be heelid þat is out of ioynte I-kutt atwo & to-broken  & if a
wounde  be not kutt atwo al togidere
ouerþwert ouer, loke if ony pece of þe boon dwelle sadliche with þe
oþere partie of þe hool boon  & þanne if þou myȝt, brynge þilke pece to
þe place þat he was yn tofore wiþ þristynge doun þilke pece wiþ sum
instrument acordynge þerto, & sowde þilke pece wiþ þe hool boon wiþ þe
poudre þat I shal telle aftirward; for so the  schap of þe
lyme mai dwelle  faire & strengere  & if
þat ilke pece haue no fastnes to þe hool boon, do þat pece awey &
regenere in þe place of þe boon þat þat  was lost a repeirement  For þouȝ þat ypocras & Galion
tellen þat it is nessessarie after quantite of þe boon þat is lost, an
holowȝ cicatrise to be alwey, neþeles wiþ þis poudre þe generacioun of
þese poris may be mendid, not a litil, but riȝt myche  Þis is þe
poudre: take frank-encense, mastik, mirre, dragagantum, gumme arabik,
ana.  ij. flour of fenegrek, .. s' caste þis poudre vpon
þe defaute of þe boon þat is lost, til þat þou holde a pleynere
repeirement  regeneratiuis, mundificatiuis


      

& consolidatiuis aftir þe techinge þat þou haddist biforn  Undirstonde
þat al þing þat is seid of boonys in þis chapitle is of alle þe boonis
of þe bodi saf þe heed  I schal make a chapitle by hym-silf 

The fifþe chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste tretis of woundis
þat ben maad wiþ smytynge of staf or stoon, or fallynge or smytynge of
an hors, or wiþ ony oþir þing semblable.

To hem happen greet difference  fro woundis þat ben maad wiþ
kuttynge, as wiþ swerd, knyf, eiþir arowe prickynge; & in oþere maner
þei schulen ben I-heelid  For þouȝ þat verry consolidacioun be þe
firste & principal entencioun of heelynge of a wounde, to þis chapitle
it acordiþ nouȝt, for in smytynge, þe fleisch & þe veynes, & senewis, &
arteries ben brusid, for in þe ynnere part of þe lyme þe boon
aȝenstondiþ, & on þe ouer part  of þe
þing þat is smyten knyttiþ nouȝt  Wherfore it is nessessarie, if þer
schulde be a wounde, þat alle þe smale lymes þat ben bitwene þe boon &
þe þing


      

þat smytiþ, schulde be brusid, & oþerwhile þe fleisch & þe oþere
consimile membris ben brusid wiþoute wounde  Wherfore þe curis of boþe
I wole ordeyne in þis chapitle. If þat a leche wolde enforse him to
ioyne togidere wiþ consolidatiuis þe wounde þat is maad wiþ smytynge,
nedis quytture & corrupcioun bi þilke consolidatif muste be vnder þe
wounde; þe which quytture schulde corrupte þilke lyme & brynge him to
putrifaccioun, but if þat kynde were so myȝty, þat he myȝte eftsoone
opene þilke wounde, þat was consowdid bi a sori leche  ; or wiþ  a good leche come & knowe þilke disposicioun & knowe helpe, wiþ propre eir  to rectifien þe
corrupcioun of þilke lyme  What schalt þou þanne do? Þou muste loke
wheþer þat þe bodi be ful of wickide humouris, eiþer be clene; if þat he
be ful late him blood, if alle particuler þingis acorden, as vertu, age,
conplexioun & consuetude; & þese þingis moten alwey  taken in mynde, þouȝ alwey þei be not I-nempned & namely vertu;
& he be not strong & alle oþere þingis acorden, þou schalt not lete
blood, but þou maist ventosen, if þat it be nessessarie, or ellis 
þe wombe if þat he be costif  ; & if þat he be feble, & þe brosure were in þe ouer
parti of þe bodi, voide þe fecis of his wombe bi clisterie. &


      

if þou wolt lete blood, þou schalt lete blood on þe contrarie partie of
þe veyne, bryngyng norischinge to þe lyme þat was hirt; & þilke veyne
þou schalt knowe, if þat þou knowist pleynerliche anotamie, þat I haue
tauȝt þee in þis same book  & whanne þat þe bodi is clensid, if þat þe
brosour be wiþoute þe wounde, anoynte þe membre þat is brosid, which
bigynneþ to haue an enpostym, with hoot oile of rosis, & caste aboue a
poudre maad of þe seed of mirtilles, & bynde it softly;  for
ofte-tymes it nediþ noon oþer eir   For þis medicyn
fastneþ þe place, & defendiþ him fro putrefaccioun. & þouȝ þat þis
medicyn mowe not letten al þe mater from rotynge, neþeles it defendiþ
myche of þe same mater fro rotynge  & if al þe mater mai not be
defendid from putrifaccioun, but sum partie þerof putrifieþ, opene þe
place & exclude þe quytture, & clense al þe place. & his cure schal be
seid in þe chapitle of apostymes  & of exitours  But if 
þat a brusour were wiþ a wounde, anoynte aboute þe wounde or ellis þe
place þat is brusid wiþ þe forseid oile of rosis, & caste aboue þe
forseid poudre of mirtilles, for it fastneþ þe place, ne it lettiþ nouȝt
þe corrupcioun to spreden eiþer to be drawen abrood; & it castiþ to þe
wounde þe corrupt mater þat is in þe


      

place þat is brusid  Wiþinne þe wounde leie þe ȝelke of an ey, wiþ oile
of rosis, with stupis, or ellis wiþ lint.  Leid  aboue þe
wounde a potage maad of .iiij parties of watir & oon partie of oile de
olyue, & flour of wheete þat sufficiþ to þe medicyn, & leie þis medicyn
to þe wounde, til þat þe akþe be aswagid, & til þat þe quytture be
engendrid; aftirward clense  þe wounde, aftir þe clensynge
regenerer, & at þe laste cicatrice. & þou schalt haue a ful techinge in
þe antidotarie of mundificatiuis & cicatriȝatiuis  But if þe membre þat
was brusid be ful of senewis, as þe hand ouþer þe foot, þou schalt not
chaunge þi cure if þat þer be no wounde; but þouȝ þer be a brusour in
senewy membre I-woundid, leie not þere þe potage tofore seid, but oonly
hoot oile of rosis, & aboue þe oile poudre of mirtillis, & aboue þe
wounde leie terebentine I-waischen & drawen abrood bitwene two lynnen
clooþis. & make a plastre of pich & hony & bene flour, & leie aboute þe
lyme þat is ful of senewis, as þe hand, þe foot, & speciali whanne þe
flux of humouris ceessen not  & þouȝ þat þi cure be drawe along, ne go
not awei from þis cure  & whanne þat al þe akþe is ceessid and þe
swellynge is aswagid, for to clense þe wounde, vse þe medicyn of mel
roset colath with barly mele, seid in þe wounde of senewis 


      

Þis cure is apreued bi galion, & I haue preued þis medicyn ofte tymes 

 Þe sixte chapitle of þe þridde techinge is of woundis þat han
enpostymes & be distempered 
Off woundes Impostemede.

 A Wounde þat haþ enpostym or an yuel discrasiam—þat is to
seie out of kynde distemperid, eiþer to cold eiþer to hoot— he mai not
be heelid, ne he schal not ben heelid, but first he  be aswagid in þe yuel discurciour be amendid  &
as I haue seid in anoþer place, it is profitable to þe sijk man, &
worschipe to þe leche, if þat he mowe defende þe lymes þat ben woundid
from enpostyme & from an yuel discrasie. For þanne a leche schal kepe þe
canoun o  galion, þat is oon of þe .iiij. canouns;
oon is to kepe lymes in her owne kyndely complexcioun. For woundis moun
not ellis be heelid, but if þei be brouȝt first into her owne kynde  &
a wounde mai be kept from apostyme & an yuel discrasie if þat þe leche
be kunnynge & do his deuer, & þe sike man be obedient to þe leche  Þe
leche muste loke if þat þer go blood y-nowȝ out at þe wounde; & if þat
þe wounde haue not bled blood y-nowȝ, þe pacient muste


      

be lete blood or ellis ventusid, takynge reward to alle particuler
þingis tofore seid  & ordeyne him a couenable dietynge, as schal be
told in þe chapitle of dietynge; & leie a defensif aboute þe wounde,
 j. of bole armoniak distemperid wiþ oile of  rosis, &
a litil vinegre: as þicke as hony tempere it  & if þat þe tyme of þe
ȝeer were hoot, putte to þis medicyn þe ius of sum cold erbe: as morel,
 penywort,  virge pastoris. Late not þe lyme hange; but if it be the arm,
hange it aboute þe necke  & if it be þe foot eiþer þe schene, lete him
ligge  & if þat þe lyme ake, aswage þe akþe wiþ an oynement of hoot
oile of rosis  For as Galion seiþ: þer is no þing more noious to a
wounde þan is akþe & declinacioun of a lyme, for þese .ij. maken soone
an hoot swellynge, þe which is to þe feuere as a welle, & to þe bodi as
an ouene  Þe woundid man muste absteyne him after þe chapitle of
dietynge techiþ, & boþe þe sike man & þe leche, & alle þat ben aboute þe
sike, moten absteyne hem fro fleischly knowynge of a womman,  in tyme of menstrue,  ne loke not on þe sike man 
& oonys in þe dai þe sike man schal go to priuy;  & if
he mai not schite oonys kyndeli in


      

þe dai after þe quantite of mete þat he takiþ, make him a clisterie
ouþer a suppositorie oonys ech day. & if þou myȝt not wiþ alle þese
þingis defende þe lyme from apostyme, it is an yuel signe, for þe lyme
is  feble, & þe humouris arn wickide; þanne bigynnen
 to materen þe swellynge wiþ potage maad
of flour, oile & watir, or ellis wiþ þis maturatif  Take malowe leues &
leues of violet, & þe rote of holihocke; seþe hem weel in water, &
staumpe hem, & take a pound of water, þat þei ben soden ynne, & comoun
oile;  .iij.; of wheete flour  .iij.; of flour of lynseed
 j.; of flour of fenegrek dj.  .; of erbis I-
staumpid half a pound. & boile alle þese togidere in a panne ouer þe
fier, & stire it weel wiþ a spature; & þis maturatif leie on a lynnen
clooþ, & leie it on þe postyme til þat it be maturid  & whanne þat þe
postyme is maturid, make þe quytture, if þou maist, be cast to þe
wounde; & if it mai not be cast to þe wounde, opene þe place þat is
moost lowist þere, as þe quytture mai best goon out; & þanne hele þe
wounde, as I schal telle in þe þridde chapitle of apostymes  Take hede
alwey to þis techinge; & if þe postyme were for þe prickynge of a
senewe, ne leie not þerto þis potage maturatijf, but wiþ þe oynement of
oile of rosis, & of oþere þingis, as it is seid in þe woundis of senewis 


      

Þou schalt knowe þe yuel discrasie of a wounde,  if þat þou
seest þe skyn þat is aboue þe wounde to reed & to hoot in felynge, þanne
þe wounde is discrasie in hete; namely, if þat þer come out of þe wounde
 a sotil quytture, reed;
þilke discrasie þou schalt helpe wiþ coldynge þe lyme aboute þe wounde
with oile of rosis & vnguentum album, Rasis of ceruse, which þou schalt
fynde in þe antidotarie, & with þe ius of þe oþere eerbis colde.

& þou schalt knowe a cold discrasie bi þe whiȝtnes eiþer þe wannesse of

of hote oiles, as oile of coste,  oile of laurine, oile of enforbium, & so oþere hoote oilis 

A moist discracie þou schalt knowe bi þe neischenes of þe place, & bi

Þe drie discrasie þou schalt knowe bi þe smalnes of þe lyme, & þe

Þus Auicenne techiþ in þe laste chapitle of þe firste book. Neuer-þe-
lattere forȝete nouȝt þe principal cure, þat whanne þe accidentis ben
asesid turne aȝen to þe principal cure 


      

 Þe .vij. chapitle of þe .iij. techinge is a wounde maad with a wood
hound, eiþer of ony oþer venemous beest  

 Bvt whanne an hound haþ biten a man, loke first if þat þe
hound be wood; & if þat þe hound be not wood, heele þe wounde as þou
doist oþere comoun woundis; & if þat þe hound were wood, þou schalt
knowe it bi certeyn cause & disposiciouns  For a wood hound fleeþ mete
& water; & he renneþ hidirward & þidirward as a drunken man, wiþ open
mouþ & his tail bitwene hise leggis; his tunge hangiþ out, but he wolde
biten alle men; ne he knowiþ not þo men þat ben in houshold. He berkiþ
not  & if þat he oþirwhile berke, his vois is ful hors, & oþere houndis
fleen fro him & berken vpon him. Also þou schalt knowe bi disposicioun
of þe same wounde. For if þat þou wetist a crumme of breed in þe blood
of þe wounde, & ȝeuest it to anoþer hound to ete, he wole not ete it; &
if þat he ete it, he wole die  Or ellis take an ote, & staumpe it, &
leie it on þe wounde al nyȝt, & on þe morowe ȝeue it to an hen; & þe hen
wole not ete it  & if þe hen ete it, þe hen schal die 


      

And anoon as þou woost þat þe hound was wood, sette a greet ventuse
aboue vpon þe wounde, & drawe out þe myche blood out of þe wounde, &
aftirward drawe abrood þe wounde; & aboue al oþere þing, brennynge of
hoot yren to þe ground  of þe wounde is moost profitable. &
leie aboue þe wounde actractiuis, to drawe out þe venym  Summe of þese
actractiuis ben symple, & summe compound  Symple beþ: þe lyuere of þe
same wood hound þat boot þe man, garlik stampid, salt fisch, aischis of
wiyn lies, appoponak þat is wondirful, þe leeues of a gourde,  & þe rote of fenegrek, þe gile  of fisch, & amptyn
I-stampid  Þese medicyns ben compound: vreyne of a ȝong man wiþ nitre;
ouþer mintis stampid  wiþ salt, & distemperid wiþ
vynegre, & maad an enplaster. Anoþer medicyn compound: take floris eris
& salt, of ech .x. parties, & þe fatte of a calf, & of a wolf þat
sufficiþ, & make a plastre  Anoþer: take schepis talow & buttere, &
make a plaster  Þis wounde schal be holden open at þe leeste fourty
daies, & þis schal be do aboute þe place. In anoþer maner regimen 
Vndirstonde þat þe man þat is biten, schal not be lete blood in þe
bigynnynge, lest þe venym be drawe abrood bi oþere lymes; ne þou schalt
ȝeue him no laxatif, lest it drawe þe venym to þe entrailis wiþinne; but
þou schalt sette


      

vpon þe place a strong ventuse, as it is seid tofore,  þat it
mowe drawe miche of þe blood. And whanne þat .iij. daies ben passid, it
is not yuele to lete blood & to purge with a litil purgacioun, þat
purgiþ þe malencolie, as with decoccioun epithimum,  wiþ gotis whey; & norischiþ him with dieting, þat fattiþ & makiþ
him glad & bliþe; & waische his heed with decoccioun of water, þat þe
feet & þe heed of a weþer were soden ynne. Ne late him not þirsten ne
hungren, suffren, ne traueilen; & so if þat god wole, þou maist him kepe
from perile  & ech dai to a monþis eende he schal take oþere symple
medicyns or compounned  — — Take þe ayschis of crabbis I-brent in an
ouene .iiij. parties, of frankencense vij. parties, & make hem into a
poudre  Þe pacient schal take ech dai of þis poudre .ij .. 
Anoþer medicyn: take þe pouder of crabbis brent vj. parties,
gencian .iij parties, terre sigillate oon partie, make poudre  If þat
þou were not at þe bigynnynge, & it bigynne to haue yuel accidentis: as
yuel þouȝtis, soruful metynge in his sleep, & þat he be wroþ & grucche,
& woot not whi; & if men aske him ony þing, & ȝeueþ no good answere
þerto, & fley lith,  & he haþ alle oþere signes of malencolie,
 þanne ȝeue to him a


      

medicyn maad of cantarides  Take old grete cantarides, & do awei þe
heed & þe wyngis, .ij dragmis; lentis 
I-clensid, . j.; safron, spikenard, clowis, canel, .ana .
s'.; bete hem weel, & make of hem smale ballis, þat ech bal weiȝe a
dragme. & ȝeue o. bal at þre tymes, at ech tyme þe weiȝte of þre cornys
of wheete, til þat he pisse blood; þanne he schal be saaf  For whanne
þou art sikir, heele þe woundis after þat fourti daies ben passid, in þe
same maner. If þat þe wounde were maad of bitinge of an eddre or of ony
oþer venemous beest, þe leche schal take heede to drawe abrod þe wounde,
& sette aboue a uentuse, & drawe out miche blood; & it is miche worþ to
enuyrounne þe place aboute þat is biten wiþ brome I-stampid  For if þat
þe prickynge be in þe foot or in þe hand, if þou enuyrounne þe arme with
brome, it lettiþ þe venym to go vpward; & ȝeue him þe medicyns writen
aboue, & also lete þe wounde be open, til þe venym be excludid 

The .viij chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste tretis of a wounde
maad in a ioynt, & is dislocate 

Whanne þat a wounde is in a lyme, & þe boon of þe same lyme is to-broke
 
atwo & dislocate—þat is to seie out of ioynte, þanne


      

it is good þat þou putte in þe wounde whanne þe blood is staunchid, &
also aboue þe wounde þe ȝolke of an ey wiþ oile of rosis, & anointe al

engendrid, & þat þou be sikir þat no postyme schal come. Ne take noon
hede to brynge togidere þe parties of þe boon þat is to-broken or

þanne it schal make quytture, and be sikir from swellynge; & þanne
brynge togidere þe brynkis eiþer þe disiuncture after þe techynge þat
schal be seid in þe chapitle of algebra. & if þat þe prickynge eiþer þe

þe wounde. Þat þou may do if þat þou kutte þe splentis & þe bindynge
aboue þe wounde with a knyf or a rasour, & in drawynge abrood þe hoole
of þe wounde  aboue þe wounde wiþ a nedle, so

wiþoute choudynge  of þe boond þat þou

hast sett togidere þe boonys þat were sett togidere & dissolate, þanne
leie vpon þe wounde bi þe hole þat þou madist in þe boond, a

ech of þese causis tofore seid haþ his maner heelynge by him-silf in
fisik medicinal. But it is not þe entencioun of þis book to treten  of blood þat blediþ of wounde, þat is maad with wounde, þe
which may be restreyned with craft of ciurgie. In flux of blood þat
comeþ of a wounde, þe leche muste loke þe disposicioun, þe abitude, age,
vertu, & complexioun of him þat is woundid; if þat þese acorden, & he be
myȝty in vertu, he schal blede myche blood at þe wounde, þouȝ þat þe
leche be clepid at þe bigynnynge, but if it be so þat he be  feble ouer greetliche. & if þat nede constreyne
þe leche to staunche blood, he muste loke if þat þe blood go out at þe
veynes capillares, þat ben smale veynes as heeris of a mannys heed  &
þanne oonly þe whiȝt  of an ey leid aboue with towȝe of flex
suffisiþ  whanne þat þe parties of þe wounde ben brouȝt togidere; & if
þou caste aboue poudre of lym aforeseid in þe chapitle of sowynge of

consoudiþ þerparties


      

of þe wounde togidere. & if þe blood come fro grete veynes he mai nouȝt
so sumtyme be constreyned, but it nediþ a stronger medicyn & also a more
cautele  & if þat þe blood go out of arterie, þou schalt knowe it bi
construccion & dilatacion of þe same arterie—þat is to seie, þat þe
blood go out wiþ lepinge & oþerwhile wiþ wiþdrawinge  ; & þanne sette þi fyngir vpon þe mouþ of þe grete veyne or
ellis on þe arterie, & holde þi fyngir þeron bi a greet hour; for þanne
by grace sum greet drope of blood may be congelid togidere & þere-bi

frankencense, whiȝt gummis, & fatt .ij. ȝ., aloes .ȝ. j., make poudre &
distempere with þe white of an ey as þicke as hony  after take heeris
of an hare smal kutt,  medle alle þese togidere, & þer is no
medicyn so good as þis medicyn is in streynynge of blood & consowdynge
of þe veyne  But whanne þat þou comest to chaunge þat medicyn of þe

medicyn  moist, to neische þe firste medicyn,
þat it myȝte falle awey bi him-silf  Neþeles it is possible þat a

blood þan þis medicyn of frank encense; & þou schalt haue greet plente
of medicyne caustik in þe antidotarie, but we ben nouȝt sikir þat þe
blood of þe veyne eiþer arterie anoþir tyme wole goon out, whanne þat þe
schorf of þilke caustik Medicine  is remeued
awey  but þis medicyn of encense with þe heeris of an hare not oonliche
staunchiþ þe blood, but also sowdiþ  þe veyne & þe
arterie, as I haue preued it ofte tymes  And for to ȝeue autorite I
sette a saumple þat come sumtyme to myn hondis: A child of þre ȝeer old
hadde a litil knyf in his hond, & he fel on þat knyf in þe former partie
of þe þrote persched þe veyne organise; þer cowde no man it staunche, &
þanne I was clepid, & I cam to þe child in  greet haaste, &
he hadde almost lost his siȝt; for hise iȝen in his heed weren turned vp
so doun;  & þe blood come out at þe wounde whiȝt as
whey, vnneþe he hadde no pouste   & þanne I leide my
fyngir on þe heed of þe veyne, & I heeld it faste þat þer myȝte no þing
go out; & so I heeld þe veyne a greet hour, & þanne vertu of his bodi
þat was almost lost quykenede aȝen, & þe pouse bigan to appere febiliche
as it were a smal þred  Þanne I sente to þe spiceris


      

schoppe þat was a greet weye fro me  ne I remeuede not awey my fyngir
fro þe place, til þat þe messanger cam aȝen, and þe child bigan þanne to
opene hise iȝen; & þanne I ordeynede þis medicyn to be maad, &
plenteuousliche I leide it aboue þe wounde, & I boond þe wounde wiþ
plumaciols & with stupis  I-leid in whit of an ey, & with a boond I boonde it streitly,
and comaundide hem to ȝeue him crummys of breed leid in water; & on þe
morowe I come aȝen, & þanne I foond þe child comfortid  & neuere þe
lattere I nolde nouȝt vndo þe medicyn  þe fader preiede me wiþ greet
instaunce to vndo þe medicyn,  but I wolde not; & so I lete
it lie stille, til iiij. daies weren passid withouten remeuynge  &
neþeles I visitide him ech day; & þe .iiij. day I vndide þe wounde, & þe
medicyn was drie aboue þe wounde, so þat I myȝte not han remeued it
wiþoute greet violence. & þanne I leide aboue þe whiȝt of an ey wiþ a
litil oile of rosis, & so I lefte it lie oon day til on þe morowe I
turnede aȝen; & þanne I remeuede awey þe medicyn wiþouten violence, & I
foond þanne þe wounde & þe veyne al hool. & of þis heelyng his fadir &
alle hise neiȝeboris hadden greet wondir  And if þat wiþ þis medicyn
þou maist not sowde þe arterie ne þe veyne, ne þow maist not constreyne
þe blood for sum


      

oþer inpediment: þanue þou must ouþer bynde þe veyne, or drawe hir out
of hir place, & bynde þe heed of þe veyne or arterie, ouþer þou must
brenne hir wiþ hoot iren, & make on hir heed a greet cruste & a depe. 
Anoþer ensaumple: þer was a child of .xv. ȝeer oold þat smoot him-silf
with a smal knyf, & þilke knyf perside o. senewe of þe arm & prickide a
ueyne þat lay vnder þilke senewe. & for þe prickynge of þat senewe
 he hadde greet akynge, & blood drewe doun to þe wounde &
nouȝt aȝenstood  for alle þe staunchis of
medicyns þat me myȝte do þerto, it wolde not staunche, þe blood ran out
at þe wounde. & colde medicyns ben greuous to senewis þat is prickid,
for þei stoppen þat lyme, & þat is contrarious aȝens senewis; & þanne I
demede nessessarie to drawe out al þe veyne out of her place & to bynde
hir & to helpe þilke senewis wiþ oile of rosis  But þe modir of þat
child sente for a lewde leche which þat repreuede foule my doom, & he
bihiȝte to heele safly þe child. He dwellide on þe cure, & I wente my
wey  Þe which leche took hede to him .x. daies, þat neiþir þe akynge
ceesside ne þe blood was not staunchid, & so þe sijk man was nyȝ deed 
& at þe laste I was clepid, & I wolde not come to þe pacient  Þanne a
fisician þat was frend to þe freendis of þe pacient blamede þe modir &
hir freendis þat þei hadden left counseil for þilke idiotis


      

biheeste; & þilke fisician purposide, after þat he hadde herd my
counseil, þat þer was noon oþer wey þat myȝte saue þe sike man from
deeþ, & he axide of þe sirurgian wheþer he coude do as I hadde seid
bifore. &  he seide, þat he coude so doon, & so he dide  He
kutte þe skyn aboue þe veyne & twynede þe veyne in hise handis, & boond
þe eende of þe veyne with a þred; & after he helde on þe senewe hoot
oile of rosis, & so bi þis counseil he was restorid aȝen to heelþe  But
who so wolde aske how þat he myȝte so manye daies be kept from þe crampe
for þat he suffride so greet akþe  I answere & seie: þat þe cause was,
for þat he bledde at þe wounde ech day, so þat þe senewe  miȝt not be to myche replete
eiþer ful of blood  Alle þese þingis I haue told, þat he þat rediþ hem
mai þe visiloker in semblable causis worchen. & if bi þis medicyn he
myȝte nouȝt sikirliche be restorid or restreyned þat falliþ riȝt seelde
whane   þanne we moten brenne þe heed of þe veyne eiþer of senewe
 wiþ hoot iren,
& þilke hoot iren myȝte make an hard cruste. & be war þat þou touche not
þe lippis of þe wounde ne þe senewe, ne noon oþer þing but oonly þe
veyne wiþ hoot iren. & if al þis craft wole not helpen, we musten drawe


      

out þe veyne & fle þe fleisch aboue here, & wynde þe veyne sadliche &
bynde hir heed wiþ þin handis. —Bi  my witt I  trowe amene
þat a bodi schulde make þeron a knotte I-knytt of him-silf or ellis
knytt wiþ a þred. I woot neuere wheþer he meneþ; for he seiþ in anoþer
place tofore þat I schulde knytte it wiþ a þred, & þerfore I suppose bi
my witt þat I schulde make a knotte þeron of his owne silf bi my witt.—&
sumtyme it happiþ þat an arterie is broken ouþer kutt & þe fleisch þat
is aboue is hool & nouȝt to-broke neiþir I-kutt, or ellis þe fleisch þat
is aboue þe arterie is helid tofore & not þe arterie; & vndir þe fleisch
þer is a swellynge of blood þat is clepid aperisma  ouþer mater sanguinis, & þerof þe pacient haþ
greet drede, lest þat þe skyn to-breke & þe blood go out, þe which blood
is hard to restreyne  for of þis maner sijknes spekiþ galion & seiþ þat
a seruaunt of sich a disposicioun was helid of a lewde man þat tauȝte
him þat he schulde leie snow on his siknes. Wherfore a man may

The .x. chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste tretis ^1 is of

Þer ben manye men þat discorden of dietynge of men þat ben woundid, for
sum men ȝeuen to alle men þat ben woundid, wheþir þat it be in þe heed
or in ony oþere place, good wiyn & strong fleisch of capouns & of

makiþ manye harmys  & summe oþere men gouernen alle maner of sike men
þat ben woundid wiþ breed & watir & applis soden til ten daies ben
goon  And if god wole eende þis book, it schal be remeuynge errouris &
declarynge & openynge doutis  I seie þat þese boþe sectis erren in her
opynyouns, for þei taken hede oonly to her experimentis not considerynge
resoun of complexioun of him þat is woundid  Þe firste secte of þese
two  þat summen oonly eten breed & watir in so myche þei ben
feblid þat blood & mater in her bodies may nouȝt be restorid; þe  which were sufficient to hele with her woundis,


      

but þei ben so feble þat þei  dien, or ellis þei languren
 longe tyme; ne þe lymes may not receyue
resonable vertu as þei schulde; & þese maner men ben of cold
complexcioun & drie & her bodies weren feble or þei weren woundid, & her
stomak & her entrailis wiþinne weren feble  Þe secunde secte seiþ: þat
summe þat drinken wiyn & eten fleisch hadde in þe membre þat was woundid
a greet enpostyme & a febre—& þo ben ȝonge men þat ben of an hoot
complexioun & a moist—wherfore þei comaundide to alle maner oþere of
complexioun þat þei schulden drynke no wiyn ne ete no fleisch  Ȝe
schulen vndirstonde þat boþe þese sectis ben nouȝt; & þerfore I
folowynge þe doctryne of rasis, auicen, & galion & of oþere doctouris, &
also experimentis þat I haue longe preued, I seie þat it is nedeful þat
a woundid man in þe bigynnynge absteyne him fro wiyn, & namely if þat þe
wounde be in þe heed eiþir in ony partie of a senewe. for þer is no þing
þat so soone smytiþ greuaunce in þe heed or þe senewis as wiyn; for he
is soone conuertid of kyndely heete & for he is so sotil, he persiþ
swiþe into þe senewis, & he assendiþ soone into þe heed, bryngynge wiþ
him humouris & spiritis. It troubliþ a mannys witt, & wiyn
greueþ alle men þat han a feble heed  & þerfore in alle maner woundis of


      

þe heed & of senewis he schal be forbode in þe bigynnynge namely to þo
þingis  þat han hoot complexiouns & moist into þe
tyme þat þe cure be ful endid  & to þo þat ben of a cold complexioun,
whanne .iij. daies ben passid, þou maist ȝeue to drynke smal temperat
wiyn, & afterward a litil strengere, aftir þat þou art sikir þat þer
schal nouȝt come to þe membre noon enpostyme. But þis  drinke schal be watir of barlich, eiþer water of crummes of breed
bene soden in whit  wyn,  or
ellis lete þe breed lie in cold watir raþere þan þou faile þat he schal
drynke  but he may tende weel to heete it, & nameliche in somer  & to

ellis with þe sixte partie of wiyn agrestis þat is smal brusk  wiyn, or ellis þis is a perfiȝt drynke to woundis of þe heed & to

to þe brayn. Of mete I seie: to him þat is of a moist complexicioun &
hoot  bi no maner wey schulde not be ȝouen fleisch, fisch, mylk, eiren,
ne no comfortable mete, but if þei weren ouercomen wiþ to greet
febilnes; but he muste holde him content wiþ ius of barli or ellis of

properte greuynge þe heed  he may eten amidoun, betis, letuse, & breed
I-waische wiþ sugre if þat he were feble. & if þat he myȝte not absteyne
him fro fleisch, ȝeue him fleisch of smale chikenes & of smale briddis &
kidis & lambis & calues I-sauered with agresta eiþer wiþ wiyn of pome
garnatis; & þilke dietynge he schal vse til he be sikir fro swellynge &
þat þou schalt knowe whanne þat akynge swellynge & extencioun of þe lyme
ben ceessid & þe wounde almoost consowdid. If þat it was a wounde  þat was sowid eiþer brouȝt togidere with byndinge, in whom quytture
was nouȝt engendrid, & if þat it was a wounde maad wiþ smytynge or ellis
chaungid wiþ þe eyr, in whom it is nedeful engendrynge of quytture,
þanne it is siker þat it schal not enpostyme,


      

whanne þat he makiþ quytture plenteuousliche; & whanne þat þe lyme is
weel disposid & not to swolle ne drawe abrood & is wiþoute akynge; þanne
chaunge a litil & a litil his dietynge til þat þou come to his dietynge
þat he was wont to vse tofore  & if þat þe pacient were of a cold
complexioun & a drie & þat he hadde bi nature eiþer bi custum a feble
stomak, þanne it were nessessarie to ȝeue him at þe bigynnynge fleisch a
litil sauerid with swete spicerie: as canel, gynger & oþere semblable to

oonly of water & of sugre —& aftir iij. daies ben passid, wiyn, & boþe
in þe oon complexioun & in þe oþere complexioun. If þat a boon were
broke wiþ a wounde or wiþoute a wounde aboute þe eende of þe cure, þat
is to seye, whanne þou art siker from apostyme & swellinge, it is good
to ȝeue norischaunt metis þat it  myȝte make a good & a

The .xj. chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste tretis.

is of olde woundis þat ben maad of kuttynge or of openynge of a postyme,
or ellis of a wounde þat is not heelid in his tyme, or ellis of sum
maner fleinge, or of brennynge, or of to greet heete, or of to greet

of mater corrumpinge  For euery olde wounde hauynge rotnes or wire
 þat is þinne venymous quyttir or ony oþir þing þan
good quytture is not clepid a wounde, but it is clepid vlcus  Rowlond &
Rogerine & þe moste  partie of men þat ben now, clepen it a
festre  or a cankre, but it is neiþir festre ne
cankre, but festre & cankre han difference fro þis  Þis vlcus as a
propre þing haþ difference from a þing þat is comoun  for ech festre &
ech cankre þat is woundid, is clepid vlcus, but it ne schewiþ not þat
ech vlcus is clepid cankre or festre


      

as I schal telle openliche in ech chapitle bi him-silf  Auicen seiþ,
þat þer ben .vj. maner of þis vlcus: summe þat ben venemous, summe hore,
summe depe, summe cauernose eiþer hid, summe corosif, summe rotin, summe
ambulatif þat is spredynge abrood, & summe harde to consowde  Of þese
maners tofore seid, summe  han acordynge with festris in
tokenes & in foormes as venemous & holowȝ & summe han acordynge with
cankris as spredynge abrood & fretynge him-silf & neþeles þei han
difference, as it is conteyned in þe chapitle of cankris I-woundid & of
festre. & alle þese tofore seid han difference fro wounde  for in a
wounde þer is whiȝt quytture & euene in alle hise parties & hole and
nouȝt departid & wiþoute stenche. Þis maner of quytture is engendrid of
goodnes & kyndely heete, & is perfiȝtly defied  But venym rotynes
 & a cruste, & al oþere superfluyte of olde woundis ben
engendrid of a strong vnkyndly heete.

A uenym vlcus is in whom aboundiþ venym sutil & liquid. If þat it be
reed or ȝelu, or oon partie redisch and scharp bitynge þe lyme, it
signifieþ lordschipe of a strong heete.

An hori elde wounde þat haþ summe greete crustis, or ellis a wroting,
sum gret proud fleisch to hiȝe. 


      

A deep vlcus is þat, þat haþ a greet depnes & an holowȝ & perauenture
crokinge.

A wroting vlcus is þat of his malice fretiþ bi cause þat þe blood is
sent to him so scharpe  Galion seiþ: þat scharp blood not oonli
corrodiþ —fleisch in woundis, but also hool fleisch 

A rotid vlcus is stynkynge, hauynge a strong heete in his ground, & out
of him passiþ a stynkynge smel, eiþer smoke, as doiþ out of fleisch þat
is rotid  þilke  word 'stynk' I vndirstonde
it bi my maner witt: sich breeþ þat comeþ out of a bodies ende, whanne a
bodi breþiþ wiþ þe mouþ in frosty wedir, þat men taken a saumple, bifor
to sle her lac dre  þanne whanne þou myȝt se þe breeþ of þin owne ende
comynge out at þi mouþ in þe eir.

A walkynge  vlcus is þat walkiþ hidirward & þidirward, & neþeles he
profoundiþ nouȝt depe  into þe ground.

An vlcus þat is hard to helin is he þat for his yuel propirte þat is
sent to him fro þe bodi lettiþ him to heele.

& for to heelen ech maner of þese vlcus, þer ben manye dyuers rulis  Þe
firste rule is þat þei moun not be heelid, but þe superfluytees þat ben
in hem ben I-dried  Þe secunde rule  but if þat bodi ouþer þe membre
be oute of his naturel complexioun, or þan þou þenke to heele þilke
vlcus þou muste brynge aȝen to his diete


      

complexioun distemprid þilke bodi ouþir membre. Þe þridde rule is: þat
if þe lyuere eiþir þe splene ben I-greued, as it happiþ ofte tymes in
olde woundis, þou muste rectifien hem  Þe .iiij rule is: þat þe
qualitees & þe quantitees of humouris schulden be temperid wiþ blood-
letynge & purgaciouns & with good gouernaile  & if þat þe eir be yuel,
þe sike man schal be chaungid into good eyr  & whanne þat þe leche haþ
tofore seen alle þese þingis, þanne he may go to his cure 

& if þe vlcus be virulent, þat is to seie venemi, loke if þat þe venym
þat goiþ out be redisch or ȝelowisch, & if þat þe lyme haue ony maner
heete; þanne waische it wiþ water of rosis & barlich. alim  & balaustia & lentiles with hony  symple eiþer

waische it wiþ watir or with wiyn þat mirre wormode,  horhone,  sauge,  pimpernelle
 hony symple or compounned ben soden yn 
Clense þe wounde perfiȝtliche & engendre fleisch & afterward consowde it

olde woundis after þat þei ben clensyd, aboue þe oynement it is good to
leie a lynnen clooþ, to distende abrood on of þe mundificatiuis of ony

A deep wounde is heelid  wiþ castynge into þe depþe of þe

for so þilke vlcus myȝte þe sunnere be heelid 


      

A wroting vlcus is heelid in leggynge specialiche aboute him colde

A walkynge vlcus is heelid wiþ fleobotomie & formacie  þat is

rectifieþ weel þe membre 

Þe cause whi þat summe vlcus  is hard to consowde is, for an

þe membre & þe bodi as I haue seid tofore. & if þe cause be vpon,  oon oþer manye, do awei þilke cause or ellis þe manye

schaue it not as manye men doon, but touche harde þat boon with hoot

The .xij. chapitle of þe iij. techinge of þe firste tretis is of festre 

Festre is a deep old wounde, & þe mouþ of him is streyt, & þe ground is
brood, & he haþ  wiþinne him a calose  hardnesse al aboute as
it were a goos penne or ellis a kane  & a festre haþ difference from a
deep vlcus & a cauernose  for a deep vlcus & cauernose of whom it is
toold in þe chapitle tofore seid, þouȝ þat þei acorden togidere in
depnes & in streitnesse of þe mouþ, þe vlcus haþ not wiþinne him a
calose hardnes  Wherfore a festre mai not be clensid wiþ waischinge
with which a cauernose vlcus mai be clensid  but it is nessessarie
aftir þat þou hast waischen it to


      

remeue þilke calose hardnesse wiþ a cauterie eiþer with a medicyn
cauterizinge þat is brennynge, þe which cauterie ouþir brennynge schulde
make þe depþe of þe vlcus holowere þan he was  Wherfore it is
nessessarie to a surgian to knowe þe difference of þis science, þat he
mowe knowe to heele boþe þe vlcus & þe festre wiþ medicyns different þat
longen to hem boþe 

& if þat a festre be in þe fleisch or ellis bitwene senewe & senewe, so
þat þe substaunce of þe senewe be not corrupt ne þe boon, it is no nede
to take noon oþere medicyn but egrimoyne & staumpe it with salt as þou
woldist make sause, & drawe out þe ius of þilke egrymoyne, & do it into
þe  hole of þe festre wiþ a penne & leie þe substaunce of þe
same eerbe þere-vpon til he haue slayn þilke festre & clensid it; & þou
schalt knowe bi reednes & sadnesse of fleisch þat is wiþinne þe festre
al aboute; & aftirward haue þis sirup of hony wiþ þe whiche þou schalt
waische þe festre þat is now vlcus I-compounned in þis maner  Take a

leeues of olyuetre bounden togidere wiþ a þred   j., of
galingale   j, boile
alle þese to þe perfiȝtnesse of a sirup, & lete it colden, & do awey þe


      

leeues of þe olyue, & kepe al þe remenaunt of þe sirup with þe leeues of
sagittel & waische þe vlcus þat was festred tofore wiþ þis licour twies
on þe day þat þe licour may go to þe ground, & aftirward drie it weel &
fille it ful of drie leeues of sagittelle & leie a sagittel-leef aboue;
& þis medicyn þou schalt contynuen til it be hool  Euery festre þat is
in fleisch is heelid wiþ þis medicyn I-preued, but if þat substaunce of
þe senewe & of þe boon be apeirid in þe ground, & specialiche if þat þe
festre be not old, & if þat þe calosite be nouȝt to hard. In þese two
causis þe medicyn of egrimoyne  ne suffisiþ nouȝt, but it is
nessessarie to haue a cauterie of fier eiþer a medicyn caustik  & of
þese medicyns þou schalt haue a ful techinge folowynge in þe book  & if
þat þe boone were corrupt in þe depþe of þe festre, do it awei aftir þe
techinge tauȝt in þe chapitle tofore  & herof take hede, if þat a
festre perse bi þe weyes of þe vryne so þat þe vryne go out bi þilke
weie, as we han seen ofte tymes, or ellis þat it go bi crokid placis &
hid placis of þe face 
persinge into depþe, it is  an vnperfiȝt cure, but
þou maist pale  it, & do it awey þe stinche with hony waischinge, enplastre,
& hony mundificatiuis, & with defensiuis aboute þe place


      

þat his malice mowe  þen lasse greue. For a festre þat is in
ioynturis as þe feet eiþer þe knee, eiþer þe hand, eiþir þe elbowe, is
hard for to heele, & sumtyme impossible  & if þat he be in anoþer
place, & he haue corrodid eiþer rotid sumwhat of þe senewe, þow þat it
be greuous for to cure it, þer is noon oþer wey, but a liȝt
cauterizacioun of þe senewe þat is hurt  For cauterizacioun wiþ hoot
iren eiþer wiþ gold, þat is bettere, it clensiþ & drieþ þe senewe þat is
corrupt & rectifieþ þe complexioun of al þe membre &  a
medecyn caustik worchiþ þe contrarie  Brennynge medicyns, boþe þe
symple & þe compound þou schalt haue to þe fulle 
in  antidotarie
of þis book, & þou schalt fynde þe maner of cauterisynge to þe fulle in

The xiij chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste tretis is of a cankre 

Cankre I-woundid comeþ of openynge, eiþer of kuttinge, eiþer of brekynge
of a cankre not I-woundid, whos techinge þou schalt


      

haue in þe chapitle of þe apostymes in þe þridde techinge  & he comeþ
of a wounde yuel heelid, to whom comeþ a malancolient mater rotid; or
for þe mater þat comeþ to þe wounde is þere corrumpid & chaungiþ þe
vlcus into a cankre 

& þese ben þe tokenes of þe cankre  Þe vlcus is foul & stynkynge, þe
lippis ben grete, wan, or blak, hard, & wiþinne kirnely, & ouer al
aboute arerid and  holowe  & þis is þe difference bitwene a
cankre & a foul vlcus & an hori of whom I haue maad mencioun aboue, þat
if þat þou waische hem boþe wiþ liȝe, þe cankre schal be palere &
foulere þan he was bifore, & þere schal falle out of him pecis
gobetmele.  & þe vlcus is clensid wiþ þilke liȝe, & þe
fleisch is maad fairer þan it was tofore, ne þe vlcus stynkiþ not bi þe
same stinche as þe cankre doiþ; for þe cankre haþ a propre sauour, þe
which mai not be write wiþ lettre; but þilke sauour is best knowe of men
whiche þat best han seiȝe cankreis. 

A general rule in þe cure of a cankre is, þat a cankre mai not be
heelid, but if þat he be do awey wiþ alle hise rotis  Þe secunde rule
is, þat he schal not be touchid wiþ hoot iren ne with hoot medicyn
caustik, þat is to seie brennynge, but he be in place


      

where he may al be doon awey  for þe more þat þou touchist him wiþ a
violent þing eiþer medicyn, þe more his malice is encreessid  Take
þanne good heede if he be in a fleischi place, where þat he may be don
al wey, & þanne kutte him al awey wiþ alle hise rotis  & þanne þriste
out al þe malancolient  blood þat is wiþinne þe veynes þat
ben aboute þe cankre. & aftirward brenne al aboute in þe place þere as
þe cankre was with hoot iren  aftirward leie on þis confeccioun maad of
flour of wheete & hony & ius of smalache,  til
þat he be perfiȝtliche clensid. After regendre fleisch & cicatrice. To
þis rule  take hede as ofte as þou wilt wiþ sirurgie heelen a cancre:
first euacue þe malancolient mater, for þat is ypocras techinge; & if
þat he be growen in sich a place þere as he may not be doon al awey, as
in þe necke or in þe tetis, or in þe face, or in þe arshole, or in þe
mareis; & also for schortere conclusioun, & he be entrid in ony place
þere as ony senewis, arteries, veynes, ben—as ypocras seiþ—it is bettere
nouȝt to cure þe cankre þan to cure. For & he be curid, þat is to seie
kutt or I-brent, þei perischen þe sunnere; & if þei ben not curid, þei
lyuen þe lengere tyme—libro vjo. afforismorum: Cancri absconditi multum
tempus perfuciunt


      

curati vero cicius pereunt  But defende þe lyme þat is hool aboute with
defensif of bole þat I haue ofte tymes seid & waische þe wounde of þe
cankre wiþ gotis whey, & drie it softly,  & anoynte þe wounde
wiþinne & wiþoute with þis oynement of rasis & 
tutie   take ceruse,  tutie I-waische & medle hem wiþ
oile of rosis & wiþ ius of purcelane  or of sum oþere cold eerbe,
putte ynne sum of þe toon, & now sum of þat oþer, til þe oynement be
weel I-maad  Þis oynement is myche worþ for to defende þat þe malice of
þe cancre schal not wexen, & also þat þe pacient vse a good gouernaile:
as drinke good wiyn & cleer & lithe, & he muste leeue reed wiyn &
troublid & þicke wiyn, & he may ete good fleisch, as motoun  of a weþer, kide fleisch
sowkynge, capouns, hennes, chikenes, partrichis,

fleisch, goos, dokis, & alle greete briddis þat lyuen in watri placis, &
al salt þing & acute þing: as garleek, oynonys & vynegre et cetera 


      

þe sike man may lyue þe lengere vpon erþe  Neþeles if vlcus be riȝt
foul & haue nouȝt so greet malice as a cankre, of þe which vlcus I haue
told tofore may be curid wiþ poudre of affadillis, and aftirward weel be
clensid; & for þat þis vlcus  þat was so foul may be heelid 
Rogeryn and Rowlond & manye oþere settide in her bokis þe cure of a
cankre, þouȝ þat he be in a senewey place, & þei seien þat þei han
heelid him  But vndirstonde weel for certeyn, þat an olde cankre mai
not be heelid bi noon oþer wey, but bi þe same wey þat I haue seid in þe
bigynnynge of þis chapitle  & if þat þou dredist wheþer þat it be a
symple vlcus or a cankre & a foul, for þe signes & þe tokenes tofore
seid beþ doutis, bigynne to mortifie it wiþ sum maner of poudre: as wiþ
poudre of affadillis, & bi my witt poudre of erbe robert   & loke aftirward þe
prosis of þi worchinge seiþ þis boke   For if þat he be a uerry cankre, þou schalt se þe more þou
woldist clense him, þe more his malice schal wexen  & if he be not a
cankré, he schal be clensid riȝt as an vlcus  Whanne þat þou seest þe
wexynge of a cankre & his malice agmenten, ceesse from þe verry cure &
turne aȝen to þe forseid cure of þe oynement of tutie, þe which þat
paliþ þe cankre. For & þou bisie þee to

 The .xiiij chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste
tretis is for to remeue causis þat letten þe cure of olde woundis 

I tolde þee aboue in þe general chapitle of olde woundis cause whiche
þat letten olde woundis to be heelid  & also I tolde þe techinge
plenerliche þat ben nessessarie to remeue ech sengle cause þat is
nessessarie, how þat alle maner causis þat letten mai be don awey bi a

chapitle tofore seid, þou schalt han a pleyner techinge. If þat þe bodi
be ful of olde humouris eiþer in þe idropisie, loke þat he may be heelid
of þilke disposicioun, & þanne heele him if þat þou canst  &  if þat he be
not ful of olde humouris whiche þat neden no curynge of olde
disposicioun. Ne traueile not in deueyn  þe sike
man neiþir wiþ medicyns corosiuis, ne wiþ kuttynge, ne with puttynge
into þe woundis greete tentis; but do aboue þe vlcus liȝt


      

mundificatiuis & swete smellynge, þat kepiþ þe membre liȝtliche clene
þat it stynke not  & whanne þat he is keuerid from an yuel
disposicioun, thanne turne aȝen to þe principal cure  & þis same þing
  I saye of yuel disposicioun of þe lyuere of what maner cause

ful replecioun of þe veines of al þe bodi, bi reednesse & extencioun of
þe face, bi swetnes of þe mouþ, bi flating   Whanne þat a man is fastynge, bi heuynes

blood of þe veyne þe which þat bryngiþ norischinge to þe lyme, &
aftirward of þe veyne þat mai best voiden þe membre þat is hurt  & if
þat þe blood trespace oonly in qualite, amende him as if þat he be to

aftirward procede forþ in alle maner oþir causis as it is told in þe

olde woundis whiche þat ben difficult to be consowdid; of þe whiche
medicyns summe ben symple & summe  ben compouuned  Symple
ben: limature of iren, flour of bras brent, vitriol leed brent, & alle
scharpe corosiuis if þat þei ben brent; for þat þei han vertu more to

The .xv. chapitle of þe þridde techinge of þe firste tretis is of a
crampe þat comeþ to a wounde 

Nessessarie þing is to a surgian to knowe þe causis of a crampe, þe
which þat comeþ to a wounde þat schulde be heelid, & also þat he knowe
þe disposicioun of him þat haþ þe crampe, & also what þing þat þe crampe
is, þat he mowe resonabliche hele þe crampe  Þe crampe is a sijknes
cordous eiþer neruous, in þe which sijknes cordis & þe senewis weren
drawen to her bigynnynge; of þe whiche drawynge þat ben .ij. causis
coniunct: þe toon is repleccioun of þe


      

senewe, þe oþere of þe corde, þe oþer is inanisioun.  He þat is of in-
anisioun,  ofte tymes he haþ a cause goynge tofore as to
myche euacuacioun of blood eiþer of sum oþer þing, as to longe
affliccioun for long akþe, or ellis for þe appetite of þe sike man haþ
ben longe tyme enfeblid; & þis comeþ litil & litil, & þe crampe þat
comeþ of boþe þese causis may not be heelid. & he þat comeþ of
replecioun haþ oon of þe .iij. causis goynge tofore  þe firste cause is
to greet akþe  þe .ij. cause is cold  & þe .iij. cause is
putrifaccioun eiþer rotynge  & þouȝ þat oon sengle cause sumtyme
suffice to make a crampe, ofte tymes alle þese causis happen to come
togiders  And þis crampe may be heelid or þat he be confermed, & aftir
þat he is confermed seelden or neuere  A surgian muste þanne be bisy in
al þat he myȝte, þat a crampe ne wexe not in þe wounde þat schulde be
heelid, wiþ obuiacioun 
defendinge þe lyme, þat noon of þe .iij. causis tofore seid ne come
nouȝt into þe wounde: þe oon is in defendynge þe lyme from
putrifaccioun  þe toþere is for kepinge þe lyme fro rotynge  þe þridde
is to gouerne him from a greet akynge  for it is more sikir to defende
þat a crampe  ne come not, þanne aftir þat he is come with
medicyns þat is douteful or dredeful to


      

do awey  For if a feuere come to an heed or to a senewe þat is woundid,
& if þe crampe folowe, euermore it is deedliche.

Take hede þanne to aswage þe akþe wiþ anoyntynge of oile of rosis, in
doynge as I haue seid afore in þe chapitle of senewis þat ben woundid;
for ofte tymes þe crampe comeþ fro woundis þat ben maad in þe heed or
ellis in þe senewe  & if þat akþe were so greet, þat makiþ þe crampe
for þe prickynge of a senewe or ellis of a corde  & if þat þou myȝtist
nouȝt defende þe crampe neiþir wiþ blood letynge, neiþer wiþ ventusynge,
ne wiþ clisterie, ne wiþ suppositorie, ne wiþ defensif in anoyntynge þe
necke, ne þe grynde, ne þe arm hoolis, þanne it is nessessarie þat þou
kutte al atwo þilke senewe or þilke corde þat is prickid, þouȝ þat þe
felynge or þe meuynge of þe lyme to whom þilke senewe or þilke corde
serueþ in parti or in al be lost  For it is bettere þat a man lese þe
felynge & þe meuynge of a lyme, þan for to deie. But it is bettere, if
þat þou cowdist, to kepe a man þer-fro with oþere  medicyns
þan þat þe senewe or þe corde be kutt al atwo. & if 
þat þou were not at þe bigynnynge, & þou fyndist a man hauynge þe crampe
for a wounde, do þou as I dide at melain. Þer was a scoler of myn þat
was a surgian þat was clepid Olyuer, which þat curide a scheþere


      

of a wounde þat he hadde in þe heed; & bi þilke wounde þe pannicle ouþir

neuer-þe-lattere þe brayn panne was not hurt. & þilke leche, or þanne he
hadde perfiȝtlich purified þilke pannicle, sowdide þe wounde wiþoutforþ
 ; & whanne þilke wounde was
sowdid, þe pannicle þat was not weel heelid hadde a dedein  & was cause of gendrynge
of a crampe in þilke wounde. & at þe laste I was clepid to þe sike man,
& I foond him hauynge þe crampe, & wiþ þe crampe he hadde manye smale
enpostymes aboute his face—& þat is an yuele tokene in þe woundis of þe

freendis I wolde asaie þe worchinge of kynde vpon resoun; I made his
heed to be schaue,  & I
kutte aȝen þe wounde þat was  consowdid wiþ a rasour to þe
depþe of þe same wounde, & aftirward I fulfillide þe wounde with hoot
oile of rosis, & I anoyntide al þe heed with þe same oile of rosis & a
litil vynegre medlid togidere, & I anoyntide þe nolle & þe necke oonly
wiþ oile of rosis, & I dide on þe wounde þe ȝelke of an ey wiþ oile of

þe heed wiþ a boond leiynge þer vndir herdis  or towȝ smal I tosid, and I openede his mouþ &
putte into his mouþ þe broþ maad of a chiken, wiþ comyn & also wiþ cleer

sike of bettere disposicioun, & I openede bettere his mouþ, & he spak
bettere; neþeles I foond þe wounde drie, & þanne I dide ofte tymes þe
same medicyn & þe same oynture. In þe þridde dai þe skyn of þe heed was
maad moist, þe which was bifore as drie as þe skyn hadde be rostid at þe

no þing bitwene þe skyn & þe brayn panne. & at þe laste þe wounde
quytturide wiþ contynuaunce of þe same cure tofore seid, & in þis  maner þe ȝonge man was heelid boþe of þe crampe & also of þe

ypocras techiþ in .iiijto afforismoris: a spasmo  vel tetano habito febre  superueniente soluit egritudinem  þat is to

Summe ben general tokenes & summe ben special of schewynge of þe

þe senewis tofore ben drawe togidere  þe fore partie of þe heed is
crokid, þe sike man may not heuen it vp, he beriþ his chyn as it lijþ on

 The firste tretis is eendid wiþ þe help of almyȝty god. Now with þe
help of þe same, go to þe secunde 
Now bigynneþ þe secunde tretis of particuler woundis of membris of
office from þe heed to þe foot  and first bigynne at anotamie of þe

Al þing  brefly ordeyned aftir my symple will diuisynge,
which þat longiþ to þe firste tretis of þis book which þat holdiþ
certeyn rulis & techinge of surgerie vndir general chapitlis as we han

so procede forþ to ech membre dyuysynge þe anotamie of ech membre, & in
ordeynynge þe curis of woundis þat ben maad in ech sengle membre. I seie
þat þe heed is maad of þre parties: of a fleischi partie, of a bony
partie, & a brawni partie. Þe fleischi partie is aboue þe brayn panne,
þe which þat is maad of an hery skyn; & þilke skyn is fulfillid wiþ
braynes in euery partie 


      

Þe heeris of þe heed weren for greet profite ordeyned þat neiþer cold ne
hoot, ne schulde not sodeynli entre þe poris of the skyn, & neuer-þe-
lattere þat þe fumosite of þe heed myȝte go out bi þe poris þere as þe
heer growiþ; & þe heed myȝte be þe more semeloker, & þat þe colouris of
þe heeris of dyuers men myȝte schewen þe complecciouns of þe heedis 

Þe skyn þat is  aboue þe brayn panne is lacertose, & ful of
þicke fleisch, þat he myȝte wrie þe brayn panne, þat he schulde not fele
sodeynliche to greet heete ne to greet cold. Þe which skyn is maad of
sutil þredis of senewis þat comen fro þe brayn, & of veynes & of
arteries sotilliche I-maad; & so þe skyn of þe heed is sotilliche ioyned
wiþ þe skyn of al þe bodi  & also þe skyn of þe heed is more þickere
þan þe brain sculle, þat it schulde ben more rare  &
more porose, þat is to seie, more ful of hoolis  Þe lacertis of þe skyn
proceden aftir þat þe goynge procediþ of þe heeris 

Þe brayn panne is maad of manye boonys  Þe firste summe,  þe whiche þat holdiþ þe prouitis þat longen to þe brayn
panne, haþ .ij. helpingis; oon helpinge is: þouȝ þat an hurtynge come to
oon boon, neuere-þe-lattere he schulde not falle to alle þe boonys  Þe
secunde help is, oon boon þat is to hard in oon partie ne schulde not be so


      

hard in anoþir partie.  Þe secunde summe, þe which þat wiþhalt þe
helpingis þat ben vndir þe brayn panne, haþ wiþinne him. iiij.
helpingis; þe whiche helpingis ben ful maad by þe  semis þat
ben of þe brayn panne; ne þe helpingis myȝte not be maad, but if þat þer
were manye boonys  Þe first help is, þat þe veynes myȝten go doun bi þe
semis of þe brayn panne berynge  norischinge to þe same
brayn   Þe secunde help is, þat þe
senewis þat comen out of þe brayn myȝte haue wey in goynge out  Þe
þridde help is, þat þe fumes of þe brayn myȝten haue wey of smokyng
out  Þe fourþe is, þat neiþer dura mater, ne pia mater, þat as þei ben
hangid, ne myȝte not greue þe brayn.

So þat þe brayn panne is maad of ij. smeþe liȝt tablis, þat oon is
aboue, þe toþir is byneþe  & þei ben sumwhat spongious in þe myddis, &
rare þat þe smoke of þe heete myȝte bettere passe out & þei ben smeþe

dyuyden þe brayn panne diuerslych  summen noumbren mo boonys þan summe
oþir speken of  but soþenes is, þat þer ben .vj. & oon which þat
susteyneþ þe sixte. Þe firste boon is clepid þe boon of þe forheed or
ellis coronale, & he bigynneþ from þe browis & lastiþ to þe seem þat
departiþ þe heed quarter.


      

 & þilke is clepid coronale  Þis boon haþ in sum maner of
men a smal seem in foldynge of þe forheed, & þerfore sum men seyn þat
þer ben .ij. boonis. ij oþir boonys ben ioyned with þilke boon coronable
in þe myddis of þe heed ouerþwert ouer; þat  þei ben
bounde togidere bi oon ioynture, þe which þat strecchiþ from bifore to
bihynde to þe lenkþe of þe heed, þe which is clepid sagittales, by as
myche as he is schape lijk an arowe  & þese .ij. boonys ben clepid
nerualia bi-cause þat þe figure of þe seem þat is with þe coronable is
þe figure of a senewe eiþer of a corde  Þese boonys ben in þe hiȝeste
coppe of þe heed & byhynde in þe nolle þer is a boon þe which is clepid
alauda.  & it is
maad in þe symilitude of þis:


: which þat is ioyned wiþ þe boones nerualibus tofore seid bi þe mene of
oon þan I-made to þe lijknes of þe boon tofore seid. & þese þre semes
whiche þat ioynen togidere þe .iiij. boonys tofore seid, ben maad as it
were two sawis, þe whiche teeþ ben ioyned, ech of hem in oþir in þis maner

 & þis ioynynge togidere of oon boon wiþ anoþir was maad bi-cause of
iuvamentis þat I haue told toforn; þer is no boon ioyned with
anoþer as þese boonys ben.


      

Vndir þe boon þat is clepid alauda, þer is a ful hard boon & holid in þe
myddil, þe which boon susteyneþ alle þe boonys of þe heed. Þe which boon
is clepid passillus, & he is ioyned byneþe wiþ þe firste boon of þe
nake. Þe schap of þe coniunccioun of þe .v. boonis of þe heed is in þis
maner


. Boþe on þe riȝtside & on þe lift side of þe forseid boonys, whiche þat
ben clepid nerualia  & þo boonys þat vndir setten
ben clepid ossa mendosa. & þese boonys in oon partie ben ful hard þere
as þe hole of þe eere passiþ þoruȝ, & þei ben clepid petrosa; & summen
seien þat þer ben .iiij. boonys ij. on eiþir side  & whanne þat alle þe

þat þer ben but vj. boonys, whanne þat þou rekenest os

nerualia þat ben .vj.; & þe .vij. boon is clepid passillare, þe which is
not of þe boones of þe heed, but he susteyneþ alle þe oþere boonys of þe
heed.  & iij. maner of semes  makiþ coniunccioun of alle
þe boonys in þis maner



      

& wiþ .ij. semes mendose in þis maner


. & whanne þat þe crounne of þe heed is perfiȝt, þe heed is maad in þis
maner

 Þis is þe foorme of an heed weel propossiound, round

þat he myȝte more wiþholde, & þat he myȝte lasse be hurt, & þat he be
longe warpid  , hauynge tofore & bihynde eminence: þat is to
seie apeirynge, þat þe senewis þat comen out of þe brayn myȝten haue a
porose place of goynge out. & neþeles as ypocras & galion, whiche þat
expowneþ ypocras, telliþ  , it is possible to
fynde oþir in maner of makyng of heedis. Oon maner is, if eminence be
not in partie of þe heed tofore, for if þat he be pleyn in partie
tofore, bi þat pleynes þe seem is lost, þat is clepid coronalis  Þe
secunde is, if þat þe heed haue noon eminence bihynde, but þat þe
hyndere partie be pleyn, & bi þat pleynes þe seeme is lost þat is clepid
alauda  Þe þridde is, if þat þer be noon eminence bifore ne bihinde in
þe heed, but al þe heed is round as a sercle, & þanne þer is but oon
seem in þe myddil of þe brayn panne: for it is vnpossible þe heed to
haue ony oþer  schap wiþoute lesynge of sum partie of þe
brayn, & were contrarious aȝens þe lijf  Bi þe myddil seem which þat is
in þe heed, þere discendiþ a ueyne comynge fro þe lyuere bi þe


      

brayn panne of a boon which þat is holid þat is clepid passillarus. & bi
þe same weye þer risiþ an arterie comynge from þe herte, & þei ben
ioyned togidere, & of þe weuingge of þe tweyne þer is maad an hard
pannicle þat is to seie a clooþ þat is vndir þe brayn panne; & he is
hangid with summe smale ligamentis to þe brayn panne in summe of þe
semes. Þe whieh pannicle byndiþ þe boonys togidere, & it is clepid dura
mater. & it is riȝtful þat an arterie schulde arise vpward from byneþe,
for þe blood þat is in him is sutil, & his meuynge is pulsatif; & he
hadde discendid from aboue dounward, he schulde haue discendid wiþ to
greet an hastynes, but þilke ascendynge temperiþ þilke flux. & it is
couenable þat þe veyne discende bicause þat þe blood þat is in þe veynes
is more þickere, & þe blood þat is in þe veynes goiþ doun sotilli. &
boþe þese veynes þat ben pulsatif & not pulsatif ben ioyned wiþ dura

engendrid pia mater  Aftir þei discenden doun to þe brayn, & þei
bryngen lijf & dewe norischinge & cordialle  spiritis,
þe which is in þe brayn & þere is defied, & þere resseyueþ naturel
foorme of vndirstondynge. Pia mater enuyrounneþ al þe brayn, & departiþ
him into iij. celoles þat


      

ben chaumbris: þe firste, þe myddile, & þe laste. & þouȝ þat alle þese
ben dyuydid syngulerly bi hem-siluen, it semeþ þat þe celole  þat is tofore in þe brayn is departid in two parties; & bi þat
cause summen seien þat þer ben .iiij. ventriclis of þe brayn. Þe forþere
partie of þe brayn is greet & brood, bicause þat he schulde resceyue
manye spiritis þat ben sent to him; for þat place is propre instrument
of ymagynacioun þe which resceyueþ þingis þat comprehendiþ of fantasie;
 & þo þingis kunnen vndirstonde
resceyueþ  bi propre instrumentis þat longiþ. &
þouȝ þat al þe brayn, in comparisoun of þe herte & of alle oþere membris
of þe body, be deemed cold & moist, þis celule hauynge comparisoun to
oþere celules is deemed hoot & drie. & þe myddil part of þe brayn is
lasse  þan ony oþere of þe oþere two parties, & her foorme is
punat  brood twoward þe forþere side of þe heed,
& scharpere twoward þe hyndere syde, þat he myȝte be þe more able to
resceyue ymagynatif þingis, & þo þingis to ȝeue to þe ynnere partie, &
þo þingis þat ben ȝeue to wiþholde  Þis ventricle is sett bitwene two
addiamentis of þe brayn; þe whiche addiamentis ben lijk to tweie
buttokkis of a man þat ben ioyned togidere, & þei ben  þis
ventricle as it were a sittynge


      

place eiþir a couche vpon þe which he is drawen abrood, whanne þat he
resseyueþ ymagynatif þingis; aftirward he is drawe togidere as a worm,
whanne þat he resseyueþ ymagynatijf þingis; & whanne þat þe sentence of
þilke ymagynacioun is brouȝt forþ, þanne þilke ventricle is drawe along,
& also þe smallere eende of þe ventricle entriþ into þe ventricle þat is
bihynde in þe heed. & þis ventricle is myche lasse þan þe oþere tweyne,
bicause þat no senewis proceden  not out of him, & þat
manye þingis myȝte be comprehendid  place þat vertu of witt
myȝte þe sunnere be gaderid togidere to take his  counseil; &
þis ventricle to comparisoun of oþere ventriclis is deemed hoot & drie.
& aftir þat þe hyndere ventricle, þe which is grettere & hardere þan
þis; þe which  comparisoun to þe oþere tweyne is demed cold & drie,
þe which is brood twoward þe fore partie of þe heed & scharp bakward, þe
which resceyueþ sentence þat ben schewid & kepiþ hem priuyliche as a
cheste kepiþ tresour. & out of him goiþ out nucha þoruȝ þe hole of þe
boon, þat is clepid passillaris, & þilke nucha is cloþid wiþ two
pannicles þat goon ont of þe brayn.

& al þe brayn is deemed cold & moist, bicause þat he schulde


      

atempren spiritual fumosite þat comen of þe herte, & þat he schulde not
ben dried for to myche meuynge þat he haþ in worchinge of vertues; & þe
brayn is whijt, bicause þat he schulde þe bettere resseyue resoun &
vnderstondynge  For if peyntouris whanne þey schulen peynte a table,
first þei maken it whiȝt, for þer wole no colour lasten but þoruȝ him; &
it is neische þat þe meuynge of vertues myȝte þe bettere han place; & þe
brayn is towȝ þat þe senewis þat goon out of hym  myȝte be þe
more towȝ, & þe more þei ben enlongid from her bigynnynge & þe more
hardere þei schulen be, & also þat þei schulden be bowable ynowȝ & nouȝt
aȝenstondynge her hardnesse. & it is nessessarie þat þe brayn be cloþid
wiþ .ij. panniclis: þat is to seie .ij. cloþis, þat in his meuynge,
 I haue seid tofore, þat it schulde not be hurt of þe brayn panne.
Al þe brayn is departid into .iij. colules 
with addiamentis of þe panniclis of pie matris, þat þe spiritis myȝten
þe lengere dwelle in þe ventricle to resseyuen bi ordure of digestioun,
foorme & perfeccioun more þan þei hadden first of þe herte; & þat euery

myȝte passe to þe ventricle þat is sewingge.  Not
aȝenstondynge þese propirtees þe brayn haþ sum substaunce of marie þe

enuyrounneþ þe forseid panniolis, of þe which mary þer may sum partie in
hurtynge of þe heed be lost; & not aȝenstondynge þe goynge out  of sum partie of þilke mary, a man schal nouȝt die. For þis
mary  is not of þe substaunce of þe ventriclis of þe brayn of
þe which mynde is maad; for þei ben of so greet nobilite, þouȝ þat þer
be neuere so litil infeccioun, or ellis þat þer falle neuere so litil a

& þo hurtyngis þat ben maad in þe heed eiþir þat ben maad wiþoute wounde
or wiþ wounde. & wheþer þat þei ben wiþoute wounde or wiþ wounde, eiþir

dyvers men haue  I-wrouȝt dyuersliche.

 I wole bigynne at a symple wounde of þe fleisch of þe heed,
in þe which þat þer is noon hurtynge of þe brayn ne brayn panne. 
Biholde wheþir þilke wounde be maad wiþ a swerd or ony þing semblale
to it, & þanne sowe þilke wounde, & caste aboue þe


      

wounde þe poudre of lym tofore seid, & do al þing bi ordre, as it is
conteyned aboue in þe chapitle of woundis of fleisch 

& if þat a wounde be maad in þe heed wiþ brusynge, as wiþ a mace,  or wiþ a staf, or ony þing þat brusiþ, þanne it is
nessessarie to leie aboue þe brusynge a maturatif maad of .iiij. parties
of watir, & oon partie of comoun oile & flour of wheete, þat suffisiþ to
make it þikke,  til þat þe mater þat is brusid be maturid;
þe which maturatif schal be do abrood vpon a lynnen clooþ & leid to þe
wounde, & þou schalt fulfille þe wounde wiþ oile of rosis & ȝelke of an
ey, & lynt of an oold lynnen clooþ medlid togidere, til þat þe wounde
ȝeue quytture & þe akþe be aswagid. & aftirward leye in þe wounde drie
lynt of old clooþ, & fille þe wounde of þe same lynet, & leie aboue þe
mundificatif of mel roset & barly mele,  til þat it be
perfiȝtly clensid; & leie aboute þe wounde, from þe bigynnynge til þat
þe wounde be parfiȝtly clensid, a defensif of bole armonyak, þe which I
haue told ofte tyme; aftirward incarne it, þat is to seie brynge ouer
fleisch, & aftirward consowde.

& if þat þis wounde towche þe pannicle þat byndiþ boonys togidere, þouȝ
þat þe boon be not to-broken, charge it not litil, but


      

take þerof good hede, & do þerynne in þe wounde hoot oile of rosis doun
to þe pannicle þat byndiþ boonys togidere, til þat þer be noon akynge in
þe wounde. & kepe þilke wounde as þou woldist kepe oþere woundis of þe
brayn panne; & kepe þe brayn fro cold & fro heete, for cold is moost
greuous to boonys & to panniclis þat ben woundid. Þer ben summe maner
men þat leien wiþout forþ on alle maner woundis of þe heed, wheþer it be
wiþ wounde of þe brayn panne or wiþoute þe wounde of þe brayn panne, in
what maner þat þe heed be hurt, a lynnen clooþ wet in þe oynement þat is
maad on þis maner  Take white rosis libram , oile of rosis
 v, whiȝt wex  iij, þei melten alle togidere in an yren
panne, & þei maken  þerof .j. bodi, & boile it aftirward in
good wyn bi þe space of an hour; & þei leten it aftirward nyȝ colden, &
þei weten þerinne a pece of a lynnen clout, & þei schapen þilke pece wiþ
a schere aftir þat þe wounde is, & þanne þei baþe þilke pece in good
wiyn, & þanne leie þilke pece , & anoon aftir þei leien
vpon þilke pece on eiþir side of þe wounde a plumaciol I-wet in good
hoot wiyn; & þei leien on a drie pelowe of herdis vpon þo two wete
pelowis, þe which drie pelewe of herdis schal comprehende þe tweie wete,
& bynde hem faste; & þei ȝeuen to summen to drynke


      

riȝt good wyn, & to ete good fleisch of hennes & of capouns; &  þei comaunden to drynke a
drope of water; & þei gouernen on þis maner alle men þat ben woundid in
þe heed differentliche, & þei seyn þat mo men ben heelid bi þis maner
cure þan dien. But bi as myche as alle auctouris ben aȝens þis cure,
namely in dietynge, I ne was neuere hardi to preue þis maner cure; for
in mannys bodi a medicyn schal not be preued which þat is not acordynge
to resoun  For alle autouris acorden þat þer is no þing  þat
so soone greueþ þe brayn & þe senewis as wiyn doiþ, & vsynge of fleisch
is cause of bryngynge yn an hoot enpostyme. Neuere-þe-latter if a man
þat vsiþ of custum sich a maner dietynge haue a strong heed, in his hele
him drediþ no wiyn, & þe vertu of him þat is sijk be strong—in sum
manere of folk wiþ þis maner gouernaile, vertu is more strenkþid, & þe
sunner þei ben heelid. But I ne procede not wiþ sich a maner dietynge bi
cause of drede lest an hoot enpostyme schulde come to þe sore, but I
procede in dietynge & worche aboute þe wounde as I haue seid tofore.

Oþere men loke  þe brekynge
of þe brayn panne be with a greet wounde, or smal


      

wounde, or withoute wounde. & if þat þer be a greet wounde, þei loken
wheþer þei moun se if ony pece of þe brayn panne be tobroken, & þei don
it awey. & aftirward þei putten bitwene þe brayn panne & duram matrem a
þinne clout wet in þe white of an ey, & sumwhat þe white compressid out,
& þei fulfillen al þe wounde of þe brayn panne with sich a maner clooþ.
& þei leyn in þe ouer wounde which þat is in þe fleisch, lynet wet in þe
white of an ey, til þat þe blood be staunchid;  & þei leien
aboue a plumaciol wet in an ey. & whanne þe blood is staunchid, þei
leien a dreie clooþ vndir þe brayn panne in þe wounde, & þei leien aboue
þe wounde a potage, þe which engendriþ quytture; & whanne þat þe
quytture is engendrid, þei leien in þe wounde carp,  eiþir lynet of a cloute; &
þei anoynte aboute þe wounde wiþ vnguento fusco; & at þe laste eende þei
leien aboue apostolicon. 

& þei asaie in þis maner if þat þe brekynge of þe brayn panne be wiþ a
rimel,  þat is to seie a chene, eiþir a creueis; & if
þat ilke creueis peerse to wiþinne, makynge þe sike man to streyne his


      

mouþ & his nose, & þei maken him þanne to blowen, & þei loken  if ony þing exale out bi þilke rimele,  — as blod or ony other mater, þei
drede not to perse þilke rimelle. & þanne summe seien þat þilke rimele
schulde be to-broke eiþir peersid from þe toon eende to þe toþir wiþ
rinspindelis,  perischinge þe brayn
scolle  A rinspindil is an instrument þat coteleris poudren  with her haftis,
þe which figure schal be schapen in þis same chapitle folowynge. & þe
worste þing þat a man may do is to peerse þe rimele on boþe sidis  But
oþere  men don bettere which þat peerse þe rimele on þe oon
eende which is moost hangynge; & þei maken as manye hoolis, oon biside
anoþer, as it is nessessarie to make an hole in þe brayn panne, bi þe
which hole if ony þing be fallen vpon, duram matrem myȝte be clensid; &
þese, in as myche as touchinge trepanacioun  worchiþ best  & whanne þat þei han maad manye hoolis,
þei kutten from oon hole to anoþer hole wiþ an instrument, þat þei moun
drawe out þe boon þat is bitwene þe ordure of holis þat was maad & þe
rimele, & þei casten him awey, & aftirward þei proceden


      

forþ in oþere maner þingis as it is seid tofore  For whanne þou
desirist way of  trepaninge  sufficiþ to þee in þe rimelis of þe brayn panne. Þis schal
be þe foorme of a trepane 


. & þis is þe foorme of a spatinam, wiþ þe which a man schal kutte from
oon hole to anoþer hole

. & þou schalt smyte wiþ a mal  eiþer an hamer on þe
greet eende; & whanne þou hast remeued of þe boon þat schal be remoued,
euene þe brynkis with schauynge, þat þou mowe not leue no maner
scharpnes in þe brynkis. Þis is þe maner of þe schap

,  & þis schaue schal kutte on þe side þat foldiþ ynward, &
it schal be blunt on þe oon side þat is outward. & þei fulfillen þe
wounde þat is wiþinne þe fleisch wiþoutforþ, as I haue seid, with þe
clooþ expressid of þe white of an ey & lynet, til þat þe wounde be ful,
& also til þat þe kynde haue regendrid a repeirement, þe which schal
fulfille þe place þere as þe boon was don awey. Aftirward þei curen þe
wounde aftir comoun cure of woundis  Alle oþere maner of trepanacioun
is comprehendid vndir o summe, þouȝ þat summen ordeyne particuler aftir
her dyuyse, diuers maners.

But bi as myche as I haue not seen in þis caas no way þat


      

myȝte remeue me from doute, bi as myche as I haue saied bi longe tyme,
boþe bi summe auctouris experimentis, & also bi myn experiment, & þat
wei is not certeyn  þerfore here þei Galien, þat seiþ: if we mowe
remeue quytture wiþoute doynge awei of boonys þat schulde be do awey, it
is good  And auicen & serapie  acorden to þe same sentence of cure of heed
akþe þat comeþ of smytynge or ellis of fallynge, where þat he towchiþ
 þe worchinge of hurtis of þe brayn 
panne, not bi trepanacioun, but bi emplastris & medicyns  & also I took
good hede þat manye mo men ben heelid bi maner of medicyns & emplastris,
þan ben heelid bi trapanes, þat ben peersynge or þrillynge  For I ne
vse not instrumentis to remeue the boon but in two causis  Þe oon cause
is if þat þe brayn panne be so myche I-slend  þat þe part þat is
broke, entre vndir þe partie þat is hool  Þe secunde caas is, if ony
pece be departid from þe brayn panne, þe which þat prickiþ duram
matrem  In þe firste caas dura mater is compressid. In þe secunde caas
dura mater is prickid, which is cause of akþe, & akynge is cause of
drawynge humouris, þere engendriþ an empostyme vpon þe same pannicle, þe
which is cause of a crampe, & of oþere accidentis tofore seid; &


      

at þe laste þei bryngen deeþ to þe pacient  In þese .ij. causis I leeue
hem  constreyned to
remeue a boon wiþ handely  instrumentis. In alle
oþere maners of brechis eiþer in creueis, in what maner þat þei happen,
þouȝ þat I be not siker of þe pacientis lijf, neþeles I procede in þis
maner with more trist, bisekynge alwey help of god, þe which þat  haþ heelid mo men bi myn hondis, þat am his instrument, þan haue
ben deed, nouȝt aȝenstondynge alle my cautels & helpinge. For soþe þat I
haue biholde soþliche resonis & þe proces of oþere auctouris, I holde
þis wey lasse dredeful þan ony oþere  for I folowe þe sentence of
Galien, which þat seiþ: if þat a man haue but o wei to his hele,  it is good þat he holde þilke wey, þouȝ þat it be yuel.

& whanne þat I come to a man þat is woundid in þe heed, & I knowe þat þe
brayn panne be broke, bi tokenes tofore seid, first I considere þe vertu
of him þat is pacient, & also his age & alle oþere particuler þing, &
nameli vertu, & gladliche I leue þe cure, if þat I se ony deedly
tokenes, but if it so be þat I be preied wiþ þe grettere instaunce of þe
freendis of þe sike man. & not aȝenstondynge her preier I telle hise
freendis þat bi wey of resoun þe


      

pacient schulde die, & þanne I worche aboute him as in a man in whom
yuele accidentis appere. & if þat þe signys ben not deedliche, & þe
breche of þe brayn panne be with a greet wounde of þe heed, & þat a
greet partie of þe brayn panne be do awey al togidere, so þat I mowe
 haue a good wey to leie medicyns vpon duram matrem  First I
do schaue his heed, afterward I leie on an eeld lynnen clout & a þenne,
 wett in .ij. parties of oile of rosis swete smellynge, & oon
partie of mel roset colat, bitwene þe duram matrem & þe brayn panne
sliȝly & softli, þat dura mater be not compressid wiþ þe clooþ þat is
wet tofore seid; & I fulfille þe wounde of þe fleisch wiþ lint of oold
lynnen clooþ wett in þe ȝelke of an ey, & oile of rosis, boþe liche
myche; & anoynte aboute þe wounde wiþ a defensif of bole armoniak ofte
tymes I-seid, & leie aboue þe wounde a plumaciol, þe which þat schal
keuere al þe wounde; & þanne aboue al-togidere I leie a greet plumaciol,
wett in good hoot wiyn. & aftirward I bynde þe wounde wiþ a boond,
byndynge ofte tymes aboute þe heed wiþ þe lynet & þe clooþ, þe which þat
is in þe wounde & aboute þe wounde myȝte not slide to no partie, & bynde
þe wounde in þat maner þat dura mater bi no


      

wey be compressid. Þe heeris of þe heed schulen be remeued awey on þis
maner: clippe hem first with scheris, afterward take .ij. parties of
water cold, & oon partie of oile  of rosis in somer, & make
hoot þe same water & oile in wyntir, & waische þe heed softliche,
takynge hede þat no water ne oile entre into þe wounde, & þanne schaue
it wiþ a rasour  & whanne þat I haue serued þe pacient on þis maner, I
lete him reste til on þe morowe, & aftirward I serue þe wounde on þe
same maner til þat þe wounde be hool  Neþeles I considere if þat þe
pacient be ful of blood, & his vertu be strong, & if he be ȝong, & litil
blood bled at his wounde, & whanne alle þese þingis acorden, I make him
to be leten blood on þe coral  veyne of þe
arme  & but if he mowe go to priuy, I helpe him oonys aday, or wiþ
suppositories or wiþ clisterie; & I procede in dietynge, as I haue seid
in þe chapitle of dietynge  & whanne þat þe wounde makiþ sufficiently
quytture, I leie in þe wounde of þe brayn panne, & vpon þe brayn panne,
as I haue don tofore; & aboue þe wounde I leie a mundificatif of mel
roset, colat, & barly mele, til þat þe wounde be clensid, & þat þe dura
mater be sowdid with þe brayn panne  & þanne I caste in þe wounde of þe
heed a poudre maad on þis maner  Take frank encense & ciperi, þat is þe


      

note of a cipres,   seed of mirtilles, mirre, ana. orobi,  j; make
poudre, & leie þis poudre in þe wounde, & aboue þe poudre leie þredis of
lynnen clooþ, or ellis lynet; & aboue al-togidere leie an entreet maad
of .ij. parties of whiȝt rosyn,  &
oon partie of wex moltun togidere vpon strong vynegre, & colid þoruȝ a
þinne streynour vpon cold water  & whanne þin hondis ben anoyntid wiþ
oile of rosis, malaxe  it longe tyme
togidere. In somer take euene porcioun of whiȝt rosyn & of wex; in
wyntir  take .iiij. partis of rosyn, & þe .v part of wex, & drawe
abrood þat treet  on a clooþ, &
leie it on þe wounde til þat he be perfiȝtliche cicatrisid. & if þat þer
were ony partie of þe boon þat prickide duram matrem, þanne I aforce me
to remeue þilke partie þat prickiþ wiþ pynsouns,  if þat I may; &
if þilke partie þat prickiþ be ioyned so faste to þe hool boon þat he
wolde not be remeued awey, þanne I remeue him awey wiþ rugement  from þe
partie þat halt, 
in makynge oon hole or two, or mo, aftir þe quantite of þe


      

boon þat schulde be don awey   & whanne þat þe boon is remeued awei, I procede in
þe cure as it is  seid in þis chapitle  But whanne I remeue
a boon wiþ instrumentis of þe brayn panne, þanne I stoppe þe sijk mannes
eeris, þat he mowe not heere þe soun of þe yren þat trepaniþ. & I remeue
þe same maner þe partie þat is broke, þe which þat goiþ vndir þe partie
þat is hool, & compressiþ þe dura mater. & if þat a gobet eiþir a pece
of a boon holde sumwhat in þe wounde, & myȝte not liȝtliche be remeued
away, & he prickiþ not dura mater ne compressiþ not dura mater, þanne at
þe bigynnynge I do on þe boon hoot oile of rosis, & I fulfille þe wounde
wiþ oile of rosis & þe ȝelke of an ey medlid togidere, til þat þe boon
be neischid & may liȝtliche be remoued awey; þanne I remeue þe boon
softliche, & I procede in þe worchinge bitwene þe boon & duram matrem,
as it is seid tofore 

& if þat þe breche of þe brayn panne were as a creueis or ellis I-slend,
& neiþer part of þe boon were lowere þan oþer, þanne I considere if þat
ilke slendynge  perce al þe brayn panne;
& þat þou schalt knowe bi þe tokenes tofore seid, or ellis þou schalt
knowe bi þis signe, þat neuere failiþ  Make  a plastre of
poudre of


      

mastik & þe white of an ey, medlid togidere as þikke  as
hony, & distende  it vpon a clooþ, & leie it
on þe place þat is hurt fro morowe til euen, or ellis from þe euene til
þe morowe  & whanne þat þe plastre is remoued awey, if þat þe creueis
peerse þoruȝ þe brayn panne, þou schalt se þe plastre more drie aȝens þe
creueis þan in ony oþer place, for þe greet heete þat comeþ fro þe brayn
 be nouȝt I-slend þoruȝ, þe plastre schal be
nomore drie aboue þe creueis þan on anoþer place  & if þe creueis perse
not þe brayn scolle, þe cure is as it is seid in þe bigynnynge of þis
chapitle, þere as I tolde of cure of wounde of þe heed, where þat þe
brayn panne eiþer þe brain is not hurt. For if þat ilke remile peerse þe
brayn panne, þer is a greet doute in þe caas, for summen seien þat it is
impossible sich a wounde to heele; but if þe remele be trepaned, & a
quantite of þe boon be doon awey, þat þe superfluyte þat is cast vpon
duram matrem may be doon awey, or ellis þe dura mater schulde putrifien
& be corrupt, & bi þat skil  þe
pacient schulde die, þe which þat myȝte  be heelid bi þe
remeuynge of þe boon  Neþeles I þat haue seen in trepaninge greet
perel, namely whanne


      

þat þe creueis is bisidis þe semys, where þat þe trepaninge is
deedlich  & I haue seen manye þat wiþoute trepanyng almyȝty god haþ
delyuerid bi myn hondis, wiþoute touchinge of ony brayn scolle wiþ ony
trepan or wiþ iren; but I helde in to þe creueis hoot oile of rosis
colat, & mel roset colat, medlid togidere aftir þe doctrine tofore seid,
fulfillynge al þe wounde with sich maner cloþis; & aftirward leie aboue
þe ȝelke of an ey & oile of rosis medlid togidere, & aboute a defensif
of bole armoniak tofore seid, til þat þe quytture be engendrid. &
aftirward I contynue mel roset & oile of rosis in þe wounde, & aboue a
mundificatif of mel roset & barly mele til þat þe ligament be fully
engendrid on þe brayn panne, & þat þou schalt knowe whanne þat þou seest
þe boonys ben  ioyned togidere, as it were two bordis
weren ioyned togidere with cole  or with glu; & þanne I fulfille þe
wounde wiþ drie þredis of clene lynnen clooþ, & aboue  a
mundificatif, til þat þe boon be keuerid. Þanne I strowe on aboue þe
capitale poudre tofore seid, & I leie on þe schauynge or ellis þe rasure
 of lynnen clooþ, & aboue al þis I leie on a treet
of whiȝt rosyn; & I do alle þese þingis þat I haue seid tofore til þat
þe wounde be consowdid 


      

& if ȝe make an obieccioun how þat it myȝte, wiþoute arerynge of þe
boon, þe blood & þe quytture be dried, þe which þat fil doun bi þilke
slendynge vpon duram matrem  I answere: riȝt as þe mater of þe frenesie
& þe mater of þe litarge 
þat is more doutes, bi emplastris wiþoutforþ I-leie is dissolued, & þer
is no slendynge of þe brayn panne, ne no wounde in þe skyn, myche more
liȝtloker & more bettere þe blood, þat is liȝt & able to be resolued, þe
which þat wente doun bi þe forseid slending, may bi þe forseid slendynge
þe bettere be exaled. Ne þilke blood is not viscat  in þe substaunce of dure
matris, as þe mater is in empostymes, wherfore he is more obeisschaunt
— — to þe attraccioun of medicyns 

& if þe brayn panne be hurt wiþoute wounde  of þe skyn, þe
which þou shalt knowe bi þe tokenes tofore seid  þanne summen kutte
aboue þe hurtynge in þe maner of a crose, & þei areren þe .iiij.
quarters, & þei kutten & fleen þe pannicle þat keueriþ þe boonis. &
aftirward þei vsen trapanes & her oþere comoun curis, as it is schewid
tofore  But I kutte not þe skyn in þe maner of a crose, but in þe maner
of a scheeld or ellis of a þing þat is triangle in þis maner


, & I make but oon quarter, & I vnwrie þe boon þat þe oile of þe rosis
may peerse yn, & þat þe vertu of þe medicyn,


      

þat is maad of hony of rosis & oile of rosis, may drawe fro byneþe þe
brayn-panne  & I do in þis caas al þing as it is declarid next aboue. &
if ȝe make obieccioun aȝens me bi costantyne  or ellis bi oþere, þat seien þat bi al oure myȝt we eschewen
þat neiþer oile ne noon oyntuose þing falliþ not wiþinne þe brayn-
panne  I answere wiþ auicen, þat seiþ: þat he worchiþ riȝtfulliche þat
vsiþ teped  oilis, & þe same tellen galion &
serapion; & also I seie þat oile of rosis, þe which þat schal  be maad of grapis of olyue trees þat ben not ripe, is not oyntuose,
but it is drie, & is clepid oile enfancinum;  & namely
whanne þat rosis ben medlid wiþ þilke oile, þilke oile haþ gete to him a
swete smellynge & a drie þing of comfortynge  animal
spiritis; & also þat oile haþ a vertu expressif, as galion telliþ in þe
book of symple medicyns, bi þe whiche þe brayn is comfortid & akþis ben
swagid  & if þer be maad ony greet blood, it is maad sutil with þat
oile; & whanne alle þese þingis ben congaderid & leid aboue duram
matrem, it is clensid 

 Sumtyme þe brayn is meued of sum greet hurt eiþer of sum fallynge or
of sum smytynge wiþoute ony wounde or wiþoute ony


      

breche of ony boon, þanne do þou as I dide to a chanoun of þe ordre of
seynt austyn. Whanne þat he wolde haue lept vpon an hiȝ hors & haue
seten in þe satel, þe hors areride vpon hise two hyndere feet, & þilke
chanoun fel doun bacward vpon þe erþe vpon his heed; & al his bodi was
brusid & namely aboute þe heed, þat anoon he loste þe meuynge and þe
felynge of al his body  Þanne a lewid leche  þat was frend
to þilke chanoun was clepid, & he cowde not helpen him, for he hadde
neuere seen þe same caas, ne he cowde not no lettrure   & at þe laste I was clepid, & I foond him neiþer
heerynge, ne spekynge, ne no þing meuynge, & I deemede him for deed  &
neþeless  I seide, & he were my broþer, I nolde not
for an .C. mark, but I asaiede in him goodnes of þe helpinge of
medicyns  for ofte tyme kynde wiþ good werkis helpiþ priuyliche þat
semeþ vnpossible to a leche. & þei þanne preieden me with greet
instaunce  & I made þe heeris of his heed to be schauen & þanne I
anoyntide al þe heed wiþ. iij. parties of oile of rosis, & oon partie of
vynegre hoot medlid togidere, & I castide aboue poudre of mirtillis, &
leide aboue a sotil lynnen cloþ þinne, wett in þe same


      

oile & vynegre, & aboue þat towȝ smal tosid, & I boond al þe heed wiþ a

in anoyntynge þe nolle & þe necke into þe myddil  of þe rigge-boon bihynde wiþ hoot oile of camomille  In þe

The secunde chapitle of woundis of þe face & anotamie of þe same.

Woundis þat ben maad in þe face, or þei be maad wiþ a swerd or wiþ sum

Brynge þe parties togidere of þe wounde & sowe hem, & worche aboute þe

Þe woundis þat ben maad in oþere parties of þe face  as wiþ a

The þridde chapitle of þe secunde tretis is of woundis of þe necke &
anotamie of the same.

Bi þe necke is conteyned al þe place þat is bitwene þe heed & þe

þe necke þer ben .vij. spondelis þat is to seie whirlboonys 
whirlboonys of þe rigge. Þe firste of þe boonys is bounde wiþ a boon of
þe heed þat is clepid passillare  with
manye smale feble ligamentis; & þei were feble bi-cause þat þilke ioynt
next to þe heed myȝte meue many weies. & þe cause whi þat þer were smale
ligamentis multiplied in þat ioynt, þat manye smale myȝten susteyne a

þei weren not so able to be meued  Þe firste spondile  is
bounde to þe secunde  þe secunde to þe þridde, þe þridde to þe fourþe 
þe fourþe to þe fifþe, þe fifþe to þe sixte  þe sixte to þe seuenþe 
þe seuenþe is bounde loseliche to þe firste spondile of þe rigge, þat þe

dyuydid in many weies bi þe heed, þe necke and þe face, & þe brest,
schuldris & þe armes; þe braunchis of þe senewis of þe heed in sum place
ben conteynued & ioyned with þese senewis  & þese senewis ben clepid

clepid felynge, & þese han also felynge. Of þese senewis þat comen of þe
spondilis of þe necke þere ben maad braunnys, þe whiche ben instrumentis
of meuynge of þo parties. In  þe necke bihynde, þere ben
ordeyned open  veynes comynge fro þe

boonys of þe heed & of þe spondilis, & þei strecchen doun to þe eeris
 in lenkþe biside þe spin boon, & þei ben a couche & a

seie goynge ouerþwert, for wiþholdynge is not nedeful to him. & in þe
fore partie of þe brest þere is sett þe canne  of þe lungis, þe which is
compounned of gristil ryngis bounde


      

togidere wiþ pannicleris ligamentis, hauynge in þe ynnere partie a ful
smeþe pannicle ioynynge togidere þilke gristili ryngis. & þilke ryngis
whanne þei ben ioyned wiþ merie, þei ben defautif aȝens þe merie  & þe
foorme of þe canne of þe lungis is as it were þe foorme of a cane,
 þat is to seie a rehed,  of þe which rehed þe
fourþe partie were kutt awey in lenkþe, & aftirward þilke caane is wrie

maad of iij gristlis, & is sett aboue þese two weies. & boþe on þe
riȝtside & on þe lift side of þe caane of þe lungis þer ben ij. greete
veynes þat ben clepid organice or ellis guydes  ;
& vndir þe veynes þer ben greete arteries, & of þe kuttynge of þilke

brawnys, senewis and cordis, veynes & arteries & her braunchis bi  parties of þe heed proceden aftir þe ordour of eeris,  & þei ben ordeyned in þe necke & in gula aftir her lenkþe. &
herbi þou maist se þat it is necessarie a surgian to make hise kuttyngis
& hise brennyngis bi lenkþe of þe necke & of þe þrote, & þat þe woundis
þat ben maad ouerþwert ben more perlous, þan þo þat ben in lenkþe 

Now we wolen tretyn of woundis þat ben maad in þis place, wiþ a swerd or
wiþ sum þing semblable to him, or wiþ an arowe or sum þing semblable to
him. & if it be wiþ a swerd, eiþir it is ouerþwert eiþir in lenkþe  &
if it be ouerþwert & þere be kutt greete veynes eiþer arteries, it is to

& if þer be a senewe kutt, þanne brynge boþe parties of þe senewe

were in lenkþe, it is not necessarie but for to sowe þe wounde & caste
aboue þe poudre of lyme, frankencense, & sandragoun, & kepe þe poudre &
þe sowynge wiþ byndynge, til þe wounde be ful consowdid  & if þe wounde
were maad in þe parties wiþ an arowe or wiþ a knyf, or with a spere or
sum þing semblable to hem, & if þer be an arowe, drawe him out; & if an
arowe be drawe out, loke if þer folowe emorosogie, 
þat is to seie, a greet flux of blood, & þanne staunche it aftir þe
doctryne þat is told tofore  & if þer be no flux of blood, loke if þer
be akþe  & if þer be acþe, putte in þe wounde a litil tent þat may
holde þe wounde open al a day, þat þou maist seen þat þe woundid man
schal haue noon acþe  & if he haue noon acþe, lete þe wounde be

& if þer were akþe eiþer bigynnynge of swellynge, þanne it were

maad in þis place  Þe firste perel is: if þat þe necke be kutt
ouerþwert wiþ a swerd, so þat þe necke-boon & þe marie of þe necke-boon
be al atwo, it is deedliche. & if þat nucha, þat is mary of þe necke
boon, is not kutt al atwo but is hurt, it is perile of lesynge, felynge
& meuynge,  & at þe
laste be deed, but if þat medicyns þat I schal telle moun helpe  & if
þat ony veyne or ony greet senewe be kutt ouerþwert, I suppose þat he be
heelid, þe necke schal neuere haue  his free meuynge;
& if þat ony of þe veynes organik, þe whiche þat ben clepid guydes, or
ellis ony of þe arteries þat ben vndir hem be kutt, it is drede of
sodeyn deeþ, for sodeyn exalacioun of þe spiritis & also for affinite of

if þe veynes þat ben bihynde þe eeris bee kutt al atwo, he ne schal

Þou schalt helpe nucha þat is hurt in þis maner: þou schalt helde into

  Þere ben .iiij. brawnys open
in þe fleischy partie of þe arm, bitwene þe schuldre & þe elbowe: oon on

anoþir on þe hiȝere half. Whanne þe ynnere brawn is drawe togidere þanne
is þe arme foldid ynward, & þe contrarie brawn on


      

þe vttere half is maad long; & whanne þat þe vttere brawn of þe  arm is maad schort, þanne is þe arm drawe
outward & þe ynnere is maad long; & in þe same maner by 
oþere .ij. brawnys, þe arm is houe vp & lete falle doun  & whanne þat
alle þe brawnys traueilen liche myche, þe arm stant euene riȝtliche &
declyneþ to no partie  & þese brawnys,  .iiij fyngir

same from þe ioynture of þe elbowe & in þe myddil of þe adiutorie, þat
is þe place þat is from þe schuldre to þe elbowe; þe cordis ben
multiplied dyuersliche wiþ fleisch to þe composicioun of þe same
brawnys, .iij. fyngir mele aboue þe elbowe. & .iij. fyngir mele

In boþe þe armes ben .iiij. open veynes þat comen from þe lyuere, & ben
scharpeled  þoruȝ þe arm. For þere is a braunchid
veyne þe which wexiþ on þe vttere partie of þe lyuere, & is dyuydid in
two parties: oon arisynge, anoþir discendynge; þe veyne arisynge comeþ
to þe mydrif; & sum partie of hir is sparpoiled 
þoruȝ þe mydrif & þe lymes of þe brest  þat oþere partie of þe veyne
passiþ to þe arm-hoolis, & þere he is forkid. & þat veyne passiþ byneþe
the arm to þe elbowe, & þere sche may be seen; & he is clepid basilica
 or ellis

splenatica. Þe toþir partie of þis veyne þat is dyuydid fro þis
assellari strecchiþ to þe vttere partie of þe schuldre: & þere is


      

 dyuydid. & þe oon partie goiþ to þe heed & þe oþir partie to
þe arm. & þilke is eftsoones dyuydid, & þe oon partie is spred bi þe arm
manye weies wiþoute forþ, þat is clepid funis  ; & þe oþere partie strecchiþ euene to þe elbowe, &
þere sche is schewid bi þe ouer partie of þe arm; & so sche strecchiþ to
þe hand, & þere sche apperiþ bitwene þe fyngir and þe þombe, & is clepid
cephalica. ij. braunchis þat ben diuided þat comen fro þe schuldre, þe
toon is cephalica, þe oþere from assillari,  þat is basilica, maken oon veyne
þat is clepid mediana eiþer purpurea. & þere ben .iiij. veynys, as it is
seid bifore, scilicet, finis  brachij þat strecchiþ bi
þe vttere partie of þe arm, & sephelica þe which þat strecchiþ bi þe

mediana seu purpurea seu fusca quod idem est is comun veyne eiþir myddil

sche apperiþ openliche in þe foldynge of þe myddil of þe arm.   Þe
veynes þat comen from þe lyuere han manie departingis  &
dyuers placis, & for to telle alle þe departyngis, it is not profitable
for a sirurgian  Saue it suffisiþ for a sirurgian, for to knowe in what
place þe grete veynes sitten & þe arterijs, so þat he mowe saue him-silf
from perel & helpe hem, whanne þei ben kutt  Þis þou schalt wite, þat
from þe lyuere þer comeþ a veyne to euery lyme bicause of nurischinge. &
for to make þe lymes ful of lijf, Arterijs comen þerto also. & þerfore
in euery place þere þat ben grete veynes, in þe same place ben arterijs.

 Bi þes þingis þat ben aforseid, þou maist wite wel þat þere comeþ
greet perel of woundis, þat ben aboute þe schuldris & vndir þe arme-
pittis,  & in þe boon of
adiutorie, & in þe arm, & in þe hondis  for whi: if woundis be maad in
adiutorijs & in þe arme ouerþwert, it is greet perel lest þe braun be
kutt awey, wherby þe arme schulde haue his meuynge; & it is perel of
kuttynge of veynes and arterijs, lest þe blood myȝte not be staunchid. 
And if it be maad a wounde with a þing þat prickide, & falle vpon a


      

corde þat is in þe  ende of þe braun, & is clepid thenantos,
 þanne it is greet drede of þe spasme & aftirward of
deeþ, for þe akynge entriþ in þe corde þat is prickid, & so þe akynge
arisiþ vp to þe brayn, & þanne comeþ spasme.  Also it falliþ many tyme
þat a man is hurt þe brede of iij. fyngris wiþinne aboue þe elbowe, þer
is þe eende of þe braun & þere ben cordis; & þanne þer wole come greet
akynge, & þanne þe spasme aftir, & þese woundis ben mortal.

 If þat wounde be maad endlongis in þe arme & in adiutorio, þanne it is
not so greet drede þerof, þerfore it is necessarie for a sirurgian to
knowe þe perel of woundis þat falliþ in þis place, & wheþer þe wounde be
ouerþwert or endelongis. & if þe wounde be endelongis, þanne he schal
ioyne þe wounde togidere & sewe hem, & sprynge þeron þe poudre of lyme &
oþere þingis, as it is aforeseid, for to kepe þe sewyngis & þe ligaturis
togidere & alle þingis as it is aforeseid in þe wounde of fleisch.  If
þer be ony nerues, or arterijs, ouþer veynes kutt  ouerþwert:
þanne þou schalt worche with þingis þat streyneþ blood, & þou schalt
sewe þe hedis of þe nerues togidere or of þe cordis. & þe pacient schal
be kept from akynge wiþ good kepinge & with reste, & he schal ligge in
an euene bed. & þou schalt leie aboute þe wounde a defensif of bole & of
oile of rosis þat is aforseid  And þouȝ þis defensijf be forȝete in
oþere woundis, in þis wounde it may not in no maner.  Þou schalt kepe
þe sewyngis & þe ligaturis with poudre & lynet, as it is aforseid  Also
þis þou must knowe if þou sewist sich a maner wounde of nerues & cordis,
& if þe akynge go not awey, þou muste rippe þe sewynge aȝen, & þouȝ þis
be contrarie to þe soudynge of þe nerues, ȝitt it is bettere to do  þus, þouȝ he lese þe meuynge of sum lyme, þat þe nerue
seruede þerfore, þan falle in þe spasme; for þanne it were drede of
deeþ  Þerfore it is necessarie for to opene þe wounde & fille it ful of
oile of rosis & of ȝelke of an ey. & vpon  þe wounde leie of
þe same medicyn til þe wounde quytture, & þanne make þe wounde clene
with mundificatiues, & þanne regendre floisch as it is aforseid  If it
be so þat þere come ony hoot apostymes vpon woundis in þis place: þanne
þou schalt worche as it is aforseid in a propre chapitre  If it so be,
þat þou leie vpon þe wounde oile of rosis, & ȝelke of an ey for to do
awei þe


      

akynge, & if þere falle a flux of blood, & þanne if þou leidist þerto
ony constreyning þingis, þe akynge wolde be þe more, & if þou leidist
þerto þe ȝelke of an ey & oile, þat wole make þe flux of blood þe more—
In þis caas what is for to done? Þou schalt brenne þe hedis of þe veynes
& of þe cordis with an hoot yrn, but þou schalt not touche þe lippis of
þe wounde wiþ iren in no maner; & þanne þou schalt leie in the wounde þe
ȝelke of an ey & oile of rosis, til al þe rynde of þe brennyng falle

regendre fleisch, and þanne þou schalt soude þe wounde 

 Of woundis of thoracis & of þe brest & of þe membris þat ben

Thorax is maad of .vij. boonys & euery boon at þe eende is
cartilaginosum  Þese .vij. boonys ben ioyned togidere in þis maner þat
euery leeneþ vpon oþir, & wiþ þese .vij. boonys ben maad fast .vij.
ribbis þat ben grete ribbis, & þo .vij. ribbis ben maad fast in þe rigge

ribbis þat ben lasse, & ben clepid litil ribbis, & ben maad fast bihynde
with .v. boonys of þe rigge, & in þe forside of a man þei haue no
fastnynge to no boon, saue þei ben maad fast with lacertis.  & bitwixe þe .viij. boon & þe .ix. boon,
diafragma is maad fast, for to bigynne tellyngis of boonys aboueforþ. &
þis diafragma departiþ þe spirituals from þe guttis. & in þe holownes
þat is aboue liggiþ þe herte & þe lungis 

Þe herte  is maad of hard fleisch & strong & of lacertes þat
þei miȝte be hard, þat it ne schulde take a greuaunce liȝtli.  &
þerfore summen seiden þat it is al braun; but it is not so, for þe braun
of a man meueþ whanne he wole, & restiþ, & þe herte is alwei meuynge &
not reste. & þe herte is schape aftir a pyne, & hangiþ in þe myddil of
þe hiȝere holownes, & hangiþ sum-what to þe liftsideward; & þe hiȝere
þerof is brood, & þat place is medlid wiþ cartilaginosis ligaturis, & is
maad fast in þe lungis  ; & þe lungis touchiþ not
þe herte, saue in þe aboue, þere it is maad fast togidere,


      

& þe lunge defendiþ þe herte from greuaunce. & þe herte haþ two
ventriclis .i. two holowe placis wiþinne, & þat oon ventricle sittiþ in
þe riȝtside of þe herte, & þat oþer in þe liftside  ; & þese ventriclis holdiþ & resseyueþ
eir & norischiþ þe herte  In þe riȝt ventricle comeþ a greet veyne þat
is clepid ramosa  þat comeþ from
gibbo  epatis, & comfortiþ
diafragma, & peersiþ þoruȝ diafragma. & þis veyne is ful of greet  norischinge blood & hoot, & it norischiþ lymes of greet substaunce.
& þis veyne goiþ bi þe riȝtside of þe herte, & filliþ þe herte ful of
norisching blood. & þanne þe blood in þe herte sutilliþ  & filliþ ful þe two ventriclis of þe herte, & of þis
clene blood þe spirit is engendrid; which spirit is more cleer & more
schynyng & more sutil, þan ony bodi þat is maad of þe iiij. elementis. &
þerfore it is turnid  into heuenly bodies, & it is bitwixe a mannys bodi & his
soule a louely byndynge.  And of þe lift ventricle þere wexiþ out ij.
  and þat oon þerof haþ a maner coote, &
þerfore of summen it is clepid arteria venalis.  & þis arterie beriþ sutil blood to þe lungis &
norischiþ þe lungis  And þat oþere arterie haþ .ij. cootis. & of þe
ilke  comeþ alle þe arteries in a mannys bodi, &
ben departid in euery lyme of a mannys bodi. & þese arterijs makiþ alle
a mannis lymes to haue lijf & spiritis; & alle þes arterijs & alle þese
spiritis þat ben aforeseid; and þese arterijs goiþ to þe brayn  & þei goiþ to þe lyuere & ȝeueþ him vertu ful myche & makiþ
defiynge  And þese arterijs goiþ to a mannys ballokis & ȝeueþ him vertu
for to engendre; & in þis place þe vertu of alle þe spiritis of a mannys
bodi ben ioyned togidere. 


      

 Þe lungis ben maad of .iij. substauncis: of fleisch þat is recchinge,
 & braunche of arterijs, & of veynis,  & of
cartilaginis þat ben holow, & þese goþ out of canna pulmonis as it is
aforeseid.  Þe profit þat þe lungis doiþ a man is þis: þe lungis drawiþ
eir into þe herte, for to do awei þe fume & þe vntemprid heete of þe
herte, & makiþ þe herte in tempre hete  And in tyme whanne þe herte is
constreyned, þanne it is necessarie for to drawe coold eir to þe herte;
& if þe lungis myȝte not drawe eir to þe herte, þe spirit of lijf
schulde be stoppid, & so a man schulde be deed  & þerfore it is
necessarie þat a man haue clene eir, for þe eir passiþ þoruȝ þe lungis
þat ben tendre & goiþ to þe herte; & þerfore vnclene eir doiþ harm to þe
lungis & also to þe herte. & þerfore þe lungis ben  departid
into .ij. placis, & if þer falle ony harm to þe oon partie of þe lungis,
þanne þat oþere partie beriþ al his charge 

 Woundis þat ben maad in þe brest. If þe wounde go into þe holownes,
þanne it is miche to drede þerof, for þanne it miȝte falle þat sum
substaunce of þe herte miȝte be harmed, & þanne þe wounde were mortal 
 Ouþer if þe wounde ȝede into þe lungis, þere were greet perel: for þe
wounde mai not be helid but if it be soudid anoon   And if þe wounde
go þoruȝ diafragma, it is mortal  And if it be so þat þe herte be hurt,
þere lijþ no 
cure þeron, saue he schal die anoon; for þe herte takiþ no lijf of no
lyme of al þe bodi, saue þe herte ȝeueþ lyues to euery lyme of þe bodi;
& þe herte ordeyneþ alle lymes to vertues, & þe herte is þe welle of
lijf; & þerfor þe herte mai suffre noon harm, saue ioie ouþer sorowe 
Þerfore if þe herte be kutt wiþ a swerd ouþer ony greet arterie þat is
nyȝ þe herte, þe wounde is mortal; for þe arterijs goiþ to þe herte
 & þanne al þe blood of þe herte & þe spirit passiþ out bi
þe arterijs, as þou myȝt se bi ensaumple of a candel. For if a candel
þat brenneþ, ouþer a weke, be putt al in oile ouþer in grese, þe fier
þerof wole out; in þis same maner is þe spirit of lijf queynt, whanne þe
herte is hurt, for þe greet flux of blood, þat falliþ to þe herte &
stoppiþ þe spirit of lijf  Ouþer if þer be greet flux of blood comynge
fro þe herte, þanne þe spirit passiþ out þerwiþ; as þou miȝt se bi
ensaumple of a candel: whanne þe talow of a candel is doon, or wex, or
oile, þanne þe liȝt wole passe, & in þe same maner it


      

fariþ bi a mannis lijf, as it is aforseid.  Þe lungis wolen take no
souding whanne þei ben hurt, but if þe leche be þe more kunnyng & soude
þe wounde or it quytture. For if it qutture, þe lungis moun not be maad
clene but wiþ cowȝyng, & þe more þat þe pacient cowȝeþ, þe more þe
wounde wexiþ   Also þe lungis ben euermore meuynge; &  woundis
 schulen
be soudid in lymes, þe lyme  mote reste; & þerfore for þe
contynuel meuynge of þe lungis, þe woundis þerof ben seid incurable  
Also þouȝ a man wolde soude þe woundis of þe lungis wiþ ony medicyne þat
is consolidatif, it ne mai not come þerto but bi a long wey as bi þe
stomak, ouþer bi þe lyuere, ouþir bi veynes, & so þe vertu of þe
medicyne ne may not come to þe lungs, but bi þe forseid weies; & þerfore
men þat ben hurt in þe lungis falliþ in þe tisik    If a man be hurt in
diafragma, þer is no remedie þerof; for diafragma is alwei meuynge, for
þat is an instrument of wijnd to the herte, riȝt as a belowe is an
instrument for a fier  For riȝt as a below, whanne he is opened, he
takiþ in wijnd, & whanne he is closid, he puttiþ out wijnd & blowiþ þe
fier 

 If þe herte be woundid, in þis maner þou schalt knowe: þe pacient
schal swowne, & þe blood þat comeþ out is blak, & he schal siȝe sore, &
þanne he is but deed 

 If þe lungis ben hurt, þou schalt  knowe in þis maner bi
cowȝynge, & þe blood þat goiþ out of þe wounde wole be spumous & cleer 
If þe wounde hereof be streit wiþoutforþ, make it largere, & þanne in þe
wounde of þe lungis caste poudre of mastix. & olibani,  draganti,
gumme arabici, fenigreci ana; & he schal ete no mete saue þat, þat he

he haue scielence & good reste, & þat he traueile not; & þou schalt not
close þe wounde wiþoute, til þe wounde of þe lungis be sowdid, & þanne
soude þe wounde wiþoutforþ 

 If þat a wounde be in diafragma, þes ben þe signys þerof: streit
secchinge of breeþ, & greet agreuaunce for to drawe his breeþ, & greet
akynge in his side, & greuous cowȝyngs; alle þese ben signys of deeþ, &
principali if þese signys be greet & greuous 


      

If þese signys ben but litil & not strong greuous, þanne ȝeue him metis

If it so be þat a wounde be in a caua  & noon of þe forseid lymes ben not

Of woundis of þe stomac  & intestinum & wombe, & anothamia 

I haue seid heretofore in what maner mery  goiþ doun þoruȝ þe necke wiþinneforþ, and goiþ þoruȝ
diafragma, & is maad fast with diafragma, & diafragma goiþ aboute þe

in þe toþer side he is more playn. & þe stomac is maad of .ij. cloþis. &
þat oon clooþ sitt wiþoute & þat oþer wiþinne, & þe clooþ þat sittiþ
wiþinne is villosus & neruous, & þe clooþ þat is wiþoutforþ is

þere ben villis ouerþwert, wherof


      

comeþ wiþholdyng  In þe clooþ þat is wiþoutforþ, þere ben longe villis,
& þat makiþ expulcioun. Þe ynner clooþ is neruous, þat it mowe fele
whanne it is ful; wiþoutforþ it is fleischi for to make him hoot &

and þat mouþ is more streit þan þat aboue. & þe firste gutt is maad fast
to þe lower mouþ, & þis gutt is clepid duodenum.  Þis is þe skille whi he is clepid so, for he is of þe
lengþe of xij. ynchis; & þanne þere ben .vj. guttis bineþe him; & þanne
þis firste gutt is maad of .ij. cootis, as alle þe oþere guttis ben, but
þe .ij. gutt is smal & folde togidere. Þe .iij. gutt is clepid ieiunum,
 id est, fastynge, for he is
euermore voide,  & þat is for he is nyȝ
þe galle & resseyueþ myche colre  for to avoide him, & þere goiþ to him manye veynes, wherbi he
is voidid  Aftir him þere comeþ a gutt þat is clepid orobum   ouþer a sak, & it haþ
but oon mouþ, & he resseyueþ alle þe fecis; & þere is fulfillid þe
firste digestioun of þe guttis  Aftir þis gutt þer is a gutt þat is
clepid colon, & lijþ ouerþwert þe wombe & resseyueþ feces  And aftir
þis gutt comeþ langaon,  & is þe eende of alle; & he
haþ .iiij. brawnys, & þerof he haþ vertu for to wiþholde þe fecis yn, &
for to putte hem out whanne a man wole  Euery meuynge of þe guttis is
kindely & eueri gutt of þese þat ben aforseid haþ diuers kynde   Þer
ben manye maner causis whi þat guttis ben folde with nerues: þe firste
enchesoun is þis, þat a man schulde not as soone as he hadde ete, anoon
riȝt go to sege as


      

doiþ a beest. Þe .ij. cause is þat þe mete miȝte abide in þe stomak for
to make digestion, & þat þat is not fulfillid in þe stomak is fulfillid
in þe guttis. Þe .iij. cause is þis, þat it first abide in oon gutt  &
þanne it is sent to anoþer & so forþ. & þanne for to holde alle þese
þingis  þe stomak & þe guttis is ordeyned a skyn, þat is clepid þe
siphac  ; & is a syngle skyn & is
not  villous, & is engendrid bineþe as is diafragma is aboue,
as it is aforeseid, & is maad fast at þe rigge bihinde, for to holde vp
þe stomak & þe guttis  In þis partie bineþe þis þer ben engendrid of
siphac ij. þingis þat ben clepid dindimi  & goiþ adoun al aboute þe ballokis, & is clepid
þat ynner skyn of þe ballokis; & þoruȝ þis dindimi goiþ arterijs &
veynes to þe ballokis, & makiþ hem haue lijf & norischinge & kynde of
sperme   Alle þese þingis þanne ben comprehendid in a skyn þat is
fleischi & of lacertis maad, & is clepid mirac, & is clepid þe vttere
wombe in whiche ben lacertis, for to helpe putte out þe fecis & wijnd &
vrine 

Þerfore woundis þat ben maad in þe stomac ben perilous, & in þe guttis,
for manie causis  Þe firste cause is þis, for her worchinge is
necessarie to þe bodi, for þei ben þe firste instrument of digestioun, &
her worchinge is so necessarie to þe bodi, þat it mai in no maner be
susteyned, ne abide wiþoute hem  Þerfore if þere be ony woundis in þis
place her worchinge is lost, but if þe wounde be soudid
anoon; & þat is ful hard & sumtyme inpossible for þei ben neruous, &
þere is no fleisch on hem, & also for þei ben alwey meuynge, &
principali whanne woundis ben maad in þe hindere partie of þe stomac
ouþir in þe smale guttis  For if þe woundis falle in þe neþir partie of
þe stomac þat is fleischi, ouþer in þe greete guttis bineþe, if þe leche
be kunnynge, þe pacient mai lyue 

 If it bifalle þat a man be hurt in ony of þese placis þat ben aforseid
in þe stomak ouþer in þe guttis, þe leche muste knowe wheþer þe
substaunce of þe guttis or of þe stomak be prickid þoruȝ or no; þat þou
miȝt knowe bi þe goyng out of þe fecis at þe wounde, & þanne þe wounde
is iugid mortal.  If a man be woundid in his stomak & þe wounde of þe
wombe wiþoutforþ ne be not brood, þanne kutte it more & þanne sewe the
wounde of þe stomak wiþ a nedele þat is iiij. squar & wiþ a sutil þreed,
& þis þou schalt speciali, whanne þe wounde is in  a fleischi
place of þe stomak,


      

for if þe wounde be aboue in a place of þe stomak þat is neruous, ne
traueile þou not þere aboute þanne, for it is an idil  Whanne þou hast
sewid þe wounde bineþe as it is aforseid, þanne springe þeron poudre
consolidatif & soude þe wounde of þe stomak, & holde open þe wounde of
þe skyn wiþoute, til þe wounde of þe stomak be hool   If it bifalle
þat a man be hurt in þe greete guttis bineþe, so þat þe wounde be not to
greet, þanne þou schalt sewe þe gutt, & þe eendis of þe þredis schulen
hange out, & þe vtter wounde schal be holde open, til þe wounde of þe
gutt be soudid  If it so be þat þe wounde of his wombe wiþoutforþ be so
brood þat þe guttis falle out, putte hem yn anoon while þei ben hote 
If it be so þat þe guttis be colde, or þat þou come þerto, & þe wounde
of þe wombe be to swolle, & þe guttis be chaungid wiþ þe eir, wherfore
þe guttis wolen not in aȝen, þanne þou must sutilli make þe wounde of þe
wombe a litil more, þat þe guttis  mowe liȝtly falle yn aȝen
wiþoute greuaunce. Whanne þe guttis ben ynne, sewe mirac & siphac in þis
maner togidere, so þat þei moun boþe be soudid togidere; for if mirac
were soudid & not siphac, þanne aftir þe tyme þat þe wounde were soudid,
þere wolde leue a crepature.  Þerfore þou must sewe
in þis maner  Take þat oon side of mirac & siphac togidere so þat þei
be euene, & loke þat þi nedel be .iij. squar, & þanne make oon poynt
þoruȝ hem ij. togidere, in þe same maner in þe toþer, & þus þou schalt
make þeron as manie pointis as þou þenkist necessarie  And whanne þou
hast sewid mirac & siphac togidere in a good maner, þanne knytte þe
þredis togidere þat þei vnknytte not, as þou seest þat is to doing; &
lete þe eendis of þe þredis hange out, & þanne springe vpon þe sewynge
þe poudre consolidatif þat is aforseid, and holde open þe wounde
wiþoutforþ til mirac & siphac be perfitli soudid, for in þis maner mirac
& siphac moun be soudid bi þis cause: Siphac is neruous & haþ  no fleisch, & mirac is fleisch, & bi þe vertu of him siphac is
soudid; & þanne do þe cure herof aftir as it is tofore   Summen seien
þat þe smale guttis moun be sowdid in þis maner: make a pipe of eldre, &
putt wiþinne þe gutt, & þanne soude þe gutt þer vpon. & I seie þat it is
not sooþ, for þis þing, þe smale guttis wolen not soude, & to þe greete
guttis þis queyntise is nouȝt; þerfore triste to þe maner þat is
aforseid, & take kepe of þe perels þat ben forseid.


      

Of woundis of þe lyuere & splen & reynes & þe bladdre, and anothamia
 

The firste schapinge of þe lyuere is maad of þe .ij. spermes as ben þe
oþere principal lymes, saue þe greetnes of þe lyuere is principali maad
of blood & is in þe hardnes of fleisch. & þe substaunce þerof is
fleischi, & it is in þe maner as it were blood runne, & chilus comuneþ
fro þe stomac to þe lyuere for to ȝeue him norischynge, & þe lyuere is
gibbous wiþoute, & wiþinne holow þat it miȝte be þe more closynge to þe
stomac. & þe heete of þe  lyuere makiþ þe stomac to seþe as
fier makiþ a furneis to seþe.   The lyuere haþ addicioun, & ben diuers; for in summe
ben .iiij. & in summe ben .v. & in summe ben .iij. Of sperme þe mater of
þe lyuere wiþinne is gaderid. & þerof comeþ a greet veyne & is engendrid
in sima  epatis, & is clepid þe ȝate of þe lyuere. & of þis veyne summen seien
þat þere ben engendrid .viij. veynes, & summen seien þat þere ben mo; &
þus veynes ben ȝatis riȝt as rootis of a tree.  & þese veynes ben clepid miseraice  &
summe of þese veynes ben maad fast wiþ þe botme of þe stomac, & wiþ a
gutt þat is clepid duodeno, & summe wiþ þe smale guttis, & summe wiþ þe
gutt þat is clepid ieiunum, & summe wiþ orobo ouþir wiþ þe sak 

 Þe lyuere is maad fast to þe riȝtside of þe stomac, & in þe liftside
of þe stomac sitt þe splene, & is schape along, & is maad fast with o
partie of þe stomac. & oon partie þerof is maad fast twoward þe rigge in
þe liftside, & haþ .ij. poris, & þoruȝ þat oon pore he drawiþ
malancolious blood of  þe lyuere, & clensiþ þe lyuere of
malancolious superfluite, & þerof þe splene is norischid. & þere is
anoþer pore þat goiþ to þe mouþ of þe stomac, & makiþ þe mouþ of þe
stomac to haue appetite  


      

Þe reynes ben set, þat oon in þe riȝtside & sittiþ hiȝere, & þat oon in
þe liftside & sit lowere, & ben maad of hard fleisch, & ben sett in two
sidis of þe rigge boon. Boþe þe reynes hauen .ij. veynes ouþir .ij.
neckis, & þat oon is aboue, & þat oþere is bineþe. Þoruȝ þe necke aboue
of þe reynes is drawe watri blood & comeþ from vena ramosa  ; & þis watri blood is vryne, & from þe reynes it goiþ to þe
necke of þe bladdre þoruȝ a veyne þat is clepid kylym,  & in þis maner þe vryne comeþ
into þe bladdre 

Þe bladdre is maad of .ij. þinne skynnes, & boþe skynnes ben neruous, &
þe necke of þe bladdre is fleischi. In men þe necke is long, for it
passiþ þoruȝout þe ȝerde, & in wymmen þe necke of þe bladdre is schort,
& is maad fast to the cunte.   Þe necke of þe bladdre hath oon braun, & is in þe
mouþ of þe bladdre  & þat makiþ a man holde his vryne whanne
he wole, & putte cut his vryne whanne he wole, wiþ help of þe wombe þat
pressiþ, & of lacertis   Of þe galle we makiþ noon anothamie, for al
oure science makiþ noon mencioun of a wounde in þe galle 

 Woundis þat ben maad in þe lymes aforeseid ben euermore perilous  For
alle þese lymes, ouþir þei ben principal lymes as is þe lyuere, ouþir
þei serueþ principal lymes, wiþoute whiche lymes þe bodi ne mai not be
susteyned  If þe lyuere be hurt in þe depe substaunce, þanne þe lyuere
schal lese al hir worchinge, & al þe blood þerof wole be disturblid þat
is matere of þe spirit, & in þis maner þe spirit of lijf is disturblid &
þe foundement of alle hise vertues; saue if þe wounde of þe lyuere be
but litil it may be soudid, so þat þe wounde be freisch & not oold hurt,
forwhi a principal lyme mai not suffre longe sijknes   Þouȝ a man
were hurt in þe splene, ȝitt he miȝte be wel curid, & þouȝ þere were a
gobet þerof kutt awey, so þat it ne were not to myche and ouerþwert,
 for þerof ofte tyme falliþ þe dropesie; ouþir if þe poris
were kutt, it wolde afeble þe stomac.  Woundis þat ben in þe reynes ben
not curid,


      

for þei ben norischid wiþ watri blood, for þat is contrarious to
soudinge  & for þe reynes ben alwey in meuynge, & also vryne þat alwei
is bitynge goiþ þoruȝ þe reynes.  Þe bladdre ne mai not be soudid if it
be kutt, for it is a lyme þat is neruous & haþ no fleisch, & is alwei
meuynge, & for he is alwei resceuynge vryne & also þe vryne fretiþ & þat
lettiþ þe souding  For ypocras seiþ  If þe bladdre be kutt, or þe
brayn, or þe herte, þe wounde is mortal.  If a leche be sent aftir, for
to come to a man þat is woundid in ony of þese forseid  if þe leche be
a man of good loos & a kunnyng man, he schal, whanne he comeþ to þe
pacient, & seeþ þe perel þerof, he schal telle þe perel of þe wounde to
þe pacientis frendis, & he schal seie to þe man þat is hurt þat he schal
ascape & fare weel; and first he schal make him haue hise riȝtis   of holy chirche, & lete
him make his testament, or þat his vertu faile  þanne he schal bigynne
wiþ his good worchinge, riȝt as he took no drede þerof  for ofte tyme
kinde worchiþ, þat þat semeþ vnpossible to þe leche, & principali if he
worche wel. Neþeles þouȝ þe leche se goode signys bi þe pacient, he
schal alwei haue his owne pronosticacioun as it is aforseid, til þe man
be al hool, if he schal ascape  for ofte tyme whanne þe pacient drawiþ
toward þe deeþ, his passioun wole aswage; & also þe contrarie þerof is
seen, þouȝ þe pacient haue greet peyne & þe signes of deeþ, ȝitt he mai
ascape  & þerfore for þese perels þat ben aforseid, he mot be war of
vndirtakynge & of biheest   If a leche be in straunge cuntre, he ne
schal bi no maner wei take sich a cure. & also he schal forsake alle
maner of curis þat ben harde to do, & also he schal forsake curis þat
ben longe for to make ony perfeccioun þerof, & he mote be war þat faire

 Of woundis of þe ȝerde & of ballokis, & of þe regioun of þe

God almyȝti þat alle þingis knewe tofore þe makyng of þe world ouþir of

necessarie þat


      

a man hauo ballokis  He made ballokis as it was necessarie, & ȝaf hem

Þe .ij. ballokis ben maad of hard fleisch in þe maner as ben wommans

& to þe ballokis comeþ veynes & arterijs, & makiþ hem haue lijf &

 Þe maris in a womman is maad neruous & is schape as it were a ȝerde

Of allopucia þat is namys of fisik þat signifieþ diuers passiouns 

Namys of phisice þat signifieþ diuers passiouns vndir oon name ofte tyme
bigiliþ a leche, & bringiþ him into greet errour  For comounli al maner
lesing of heer is clepid allopucia  ; saue for to seie þe soþe, allopucia is a
maner spice  of lepre þat comeþ of rotid fleume  Saue in þis
chapitre I wole speke of allopucia þat falliþ oonli in þe heed. Allopix
in grew, is seid a fox in latin, for a fox in sum tyme of þe ȝeer his

Tinea  is as
miche to seie as a


      

reremous, for þe heeris of a reremous ben alwey aboute þe heed, &
þerfore cirurgians makiþ difference bitwixe allopuciam & tineam, for þei
 clepid tineam þere þat þere is corrupcioun in þe skyn wiþ
harde crustis & quytture  Saue allopucia is whanne þe heeris falliþ
awei wiþoute ony wise of þe skyn. 

 Allopucia þat is wiþoute comeþ of þe skyn,  & sumtyme it comeþ in þe
eende of a siknes for defaute of norischinge of þe bodi þat schulde
helpe to norische þe heeris, ouþir it comeþ, for þe poris openeþ to

bodi wiþ good metis þat engendriþ good blood, & frote wel þe heeris of
his heed wiþ þin hond & anoynte it wiþ oile of mirtillorum  If þis
suffise not, frote wel þe heeris of his heed with þin hond til þe skyn
of his heed bicome reed; & þan frote it wiþ ryndis of an oynoun til it

þanne anoynte þe place wiþ grece of a maulard. & whanne þe heeris wexen

If it so be þat allopucia comeþ of vijs  of humouris, þat

blood, & if vlcera be in þe skyn, & if al þe skyn be reed & ful of
quytture, alle þes ben signys of aboundaunce of blood. If it so be þat
his bodi be leene, & þe colour of þe place be rufus ouþer ȝelow, & vlcer
be drie, it is signe þat colre is þe cause  If his bodi be sumwhat
whijt, & if he haþ smale veynis, & if he haue miche moisture in his
mouþ, & if his vryne be whijt & þicke, & if he þirstiþ not, & if þe
place be whijt & neische and miche moisture þeron wiþouten ony
brennynge, it is a signe of fleume  If þe colour of his bodi be derk
ouþer blac, & if he be leene, & if his vryne be pale & þinne,  & if he haþ greet appetit, & if his blood be blac, & if he vsiþ
miche for to ete beef & caul, &

Of morphue  and impetigine  

 Now we han medycyns drawen of .ij. wellis & of manie
maistris, þat is to wite: of Salerne, & of Costantyn, & Platearij, & of
Iohannes de sancto Paulo & of oþere manie auctouris, as of Ipocras,
Galien, & Serapion, & Isaac, & Iohanne Mesue, Auicen  Hali þe abbot,
& Rasis, & of oþere manie auctouris  Alle þese auctouris speciali ȝeue
it us, saue þei acorden not in names  ^5 Forwhi impetigo, serpigo &
morphea ben seid in salerne diuers names, for þat men of salerne clepen
albam & arabes clepen impetigo morphea  & men of salerne clepen
morpheam  men in arabie clepen it albarec ^5  & þerfore I wole in þis book
teche þe


      

difference of euery of hem, & after þat þe curis of hem  & I seie þat
serpigo is a scharpnes of a mannes skyn, & it is clepid serpigo, for it
passiþ fro place to place. Þou schalt cure it wiþ gumme of cheritrees
distemperid wiþ vinegre, ouþer gumme of plumtre & anoynte wiþ buttir &
turbentyne. & þis oynement is good þerfore  Take gres  of a
doke clene purid, ysopi humide, olium ro., ȝelow wex, terbentyne,
mussilaginis seminis citoniorum  ana, make
of alle þese an oynement, & anoynte him þerwith amorowe, & þanne waische
him in watir þat þer haþ leie þeron semen melonum & violet. & be he ofte
baþid wiþ sich swete water. & good swete mete is good for hem þat
engendriþ good humouris 

 Impetigo is anoþer maner passioun, as whanne a mannys skyn chaungiþ in
oþer colour þan it schulde, & propirli into whit colour & wiþouten ony
harmyng of þe skyn. & þer is no þing þeron þat harmeþ a man, saue oonly
þe colour of þe skyn chaungiþ oþir þan it schulde be  

 Morphea is a passioun þat þe skyn is out of his propir colour & þe
skyn is harmed þerbi. & morphea is a spice of lepre þat sitt in þe skyn;
for riȝt as lepre sittiþ in þe fleisch, in þe same maner riȝt so morphea
sittiþ in þe skyn. 

 Albaras.  Not oonly þe skyn, saue þe fleisch is
harmed þerbi  Þis is þe difference of albaras & morphea  In morphea þe
vertu of expulcion  is strong  &
þe mater  þerof is but litil, & þerfore it is al putt into
þe skyn  In albaras þe vertu of expulcion is but feble & þe matere is
corrupt, & þerfor it is boþe in þe fleisch & in þe skyn, & þer is but
litil difference bitwixe albaras & lepre, saue albaras abidiþ alwei in
oon place, & lepre goiþ into al þe bodi  In boþe þese causis it is nede
for to avoide humouris þat ben in þe cause  ,


      

saue þat oon mote haue stronger medicyns þan þat oþer.  Impetigo muste
haue abstynence fro þingis þat engendriþ fleume, & he muste haue a
purgacioun for to purge fleume  Anoynte þe place wiþ oile of whete þat
is maad in þis maner  Take whete & leie bitwixe two platis of iren
hoot  & presse hem togidere & þerof wole bicome oile   Also in
anoþer maner  Take .ij. vessels of erþe, so þat þe mouþ of þe oon
vessel go to þe mouþ of þe toþer vessel, & þat oon vessel schal stonde
in þe erþe, & in þe vessel aboue þou schalt do þi whete, & þou schalt
stoppe þe mouþ of þe vessel þat is aboue þat þe whete is ynne with a
plate of bras ouþer of iren þat is bettere,  & þe plate
schal be ful of smale holis. & þan þe mouþ of þis pott schal be ioyned
to þe mouþ of þe pott þat is in þe erþe with good lute, þat þere mowe
noon eir out þerof. & þan make a fier aboute þe pott þat is aboue þe
erþe, & þere wole distille oile into þe pott þat is bineþe in þe erþe, &
wiþ þis oile þou schalt anoynte þe place ofte, & frote harde. & if þis
suffise not, þanne þou schalt sette vpon þe place watir lechis ofte, for
to do awey þe fleumatik blood  If þis suffise not, leie þervpon a
mundificatif of cantarides stampid wiþ whete, til þe place schyne  , & þan cure it vp wiþ an
oynment of ceruce  Frote him wiþ an oynement maad of armoniac & with þe
sournes of citri, & nitro is good þerfore 

 Þe white morphu is curid wiþ purgacioun þat purgiþ roten fleume, & wiþ
þis special medicyn  ℞, trifere minorum .ȝ .iiij., turbit, pulueris
pigre .ȝ .ij., colloquintide .ȝ ij., make herof pelottis wiþ hony, & he
schal take þerof .iij pelottis euery wike, & eueri dai bitwixe he schal
take .ȝ ij. of trifere minorum, & he mote absteyne him fro metis þat
engendriþ  fleume; & þe place shal be frotid in þe sunne wiþ
an oynement of tapsia, & þe seed of raphani, rubie maioris  elleboro
nigro & mustard, & distempere hem wiþ vinegre  Also froting wiþ
squillis is good þerfore 

 Þe blac morphe is curid wiþ ofte purging of malancoli, wiþ gotis whei,
& wiþ epithimo, & oþere medicyns þat purgiþ malancolie, þat be forseid
in allopucia; & his dietyng schal be moist, & he schal absteyne him fro
metis þat engendriþ malancolie, & he schal be baþid ofte in swete watir,
& he schal be anoyntid & frotid as it is aforseid 

 Albaras þat is whit is curid wiþ þe same þingis & with


      

stronger medicyns þat ben aforseid in þe cure of þe white morphu, &
miche castyng is good for hem, & þou schalt frote wel þe place with
squillis in a stewe, & after þat sprynge þeron poudre maad of tapsia, &
staphisagre, & þe wombis of cantarides, & seed of eruce, & tordis of a
culuere, & þou schalt anoynte him wiþ blood of a blac serpent, for þat
is bi propirte good þerfore 

Albaras þat is blak is incurable, for it is a particuler lepre, & but
 if it be so þat it mowe be take awei wiþ alle rootis, it
schal neuere be curid; saue þe colour of his skyn mai be amendid  ℞,
aloxanti, þat is þe flour of þe wiþi,  mirram, feces of wijn brent, reed cley, & alyme,
poudre alle þese, & herwiþ frote þe place til þe pacient fele prickyng &
brennyng. Þis wole deye þe skyn for manie daies, & whanne þis failiþ
reherse it aȝen.

 Of lepre and of þe domys of lepre  

Lepra 
is a foul sijknes þat comeþ of malancolie corrupt, ouþir of humouris þat
ben brouȝt to þe forme of malancolye  corrupt. & it goiþ
into al þe bodi, riȝt as a cancre is in oon lyme of a mannes bodi  For
whanne malancolie multiplieþ  , & a mannes guttis
ben not strong for to putte it out, & þe weies bitwixe þe splene ben
stoppid & þe poris of þe skyn closid, þan malancolious blood wole rote
wiþinne, & rotiþ complexiouns of þe lymes. & þe bigynnying of þe mater
myȝte be of blood ouþir of fleume, colre, ouþer of malancolie, neþeles
whanne þe mater is fulfild  it is malancolie corrupt. & þis
is oon of the syknessis þat ben contagious   In þis place I wole sette
curis of lepre þat ben profitable for a cirurgian to kunne, & also curis
þat comeþ ofte to a cirurgian handis 


      

Men þat ben leprous,  in þe bigynnyng her
heeris of her heed falliþ awei, & þe heeris of her browis, & þe heeris
of her berd; & her forheed bicomeþ reed & as it were schynyng.  Also in
summe þe face wexiþ reed & swelliþ & is sumwhat ledi, & principali
aboute     Also her vois is rowȝ ouþer
sumtyme it is wondirly scharp, & þe whit of her iȝen bicomeþ al derk, &
þe heeris goon awei of her browis  Her noseþrillis bicomeþ smal, ouþer
wondirly greet, & her noseþrillis ben streit for to drawe yn wijnd, &
her nailis bicomeþ ledi  Also her breeþ wole stynke & her sotes  Also
her pisce wole be streit  & þei schulen haue greet snesyng  Also þei
wilneþ myche to comne  wiþ wommen  Also þei schulen
be heuy, & if her skyn be in þe coold eir, it wole bicome as it were þe
skyn of a gandir  þat þat hise feþeris weren pilid awey 
Also þese ben priuy þingis: if þou prickist his leg bihynde, he ne schal
not fele it  & if þou waisschist hise lymes in watir, anoon riȝt it
wole drie yn  Also þese signes ben comoun: his yȝen wolen bicome
rounde, & þer wolen wexe pustulis in his tunge, & her nailis wolen
bicome greet, & þer wolen wexe scabbis abouteforþ. And þe fleisch þat
schulde be bitwixe þe þombe & þe nexte fyngir þerto schal be wastid
awey, & if þou prickist him in þe hele he schal not fele it, & if he be
lete blood, her blood wole be scharpe & as it were ful of grauel. & if
þou waischist her blood, in þe botme þerof wole leue as it were grauel.
& þis sijknes aftir þe tyme þat it is confermed is incurable, saue in þe
firste bigynnyng it mai be curid wel 

 Þe cure of lepre is not sett in þis book, for þis book is of cirurgie,
saf þer ben in þis solempne medicyns & apreued for to kepe a man, þat
þei schulen not wexe, & for to make it priuy, & cauterijs þerfore  For
alle þese þingis falliþ for a cirurgian  Þis  þou schalt
knowe: if þe siknes be strong, it is hard for to do ony medicyne þerto;
fforwhi, if þe sijknes be strong, þanne he muste haue stronge medicyns,
& þat were greet perel, & also þe medicyn muste be ofte rehersid.  Saue þou schalt chese a liȝt medicyn þat


      

wole falle for to purge þe humour liȝtli  A medicyn maad of gotis whey
wiþ epithimo, þis medicyn is riȝt & good, for it purgiþ malancolie litil
& litil, & also a man schal not be greued þerebi  Pelottis þat be maad
of epithimo þat ben aforseid in þe tretijs of allopucia ben good
herfore, for þin entent schal be oonly for to purge malancolie þat is
corrupt, & amende his complexioun wiþ good dietyng. Blood letyng is not
good þerfore, but if þe cauce come miche of blood  If his breeþ be
streit, þanne it comeþ of þe veyne þat goiþ to þe herte  Sumtyme it is
in þe veyne of þe nose   Þou schalt ȝeue to men þat ben drie lepre & comeþ
myche of colre, þou schalt ȝeue him gotis whey ofte for to drynke, &
 þou schalt, in as miche as þou miȝt, make his complexioun
moist & baþe him in tempere baþ & lete him swete þerinne; & þan þou
schalt anoynte him wiþ oile of violet & oile of cucurbita, & þou schalt
ȝeue him good metis þat engendriþ good blood, & hese metis & hise
drinkis schulen be in tempere heete, not to hoot ne to coold   Summen
curiþ hem wiþ þe fleisch of a blac eddre  þat ben in drie lond & among stones, & þan þei kutten

þei doon hem in  a vessel of erþe wiþ a litil peper &
galyngale & salt & vinegre & watir & oile, & so þei seþe þe eddre til al
þe fleisch þerof be dissolued. Þanne þe broþ herof is ȝeuen to drynke, &
þe fleisch for to ete til þe pacient haue scotomiam  & al his bodi to-swolle  Whanne his bodi is to-
swolle & he haþ had scotomiam, þan leie him in a bed & lete him ligge; &
if þere falle ony þing to him as syncopis, ouþer greet cooldnes of hise

him tiriaca maior wiþ a litil musco ouþer hoot wijn  In þis maner al
his  fleisch wole pile & alle hise heeris wolen falle awei &
newe heeris wolen come vp aȝen  & þis medicyne schal be rehersid so
ofte, & kepid wiþ dietyng til he be perfitli hool  Forwhi manie men
moun be delyuerid of manye greet sijknessis, if her leche is kunnynge &

 Of waastynge off membris and bicomen smal 

A Mannes lyme bicomeþ smal wiþ greet streynyng of ligaturis þat takiþ
awei þe norisching of þe lyme, or of long akyng of ioynt þat enfebliþ al
þe lyme  Þese þingis makiþ a mannes lymes to bicome smal   Also a
mannes lymes bicomeþ greet oþer þan þei schulde be,  whanne veynes ben feble & matere
falliþ þerto & þe vertu of souding failiþ, & in þis maner þe lyme
swelliþ, & þe mater is fleumatik, & for defaute of heete it turneþ not
into quitture  saue it abidiþ in þe lyme & swelliþ þe lyme 

 A lyme þat is bicome smal, in þis maner þou schalt make it greet: if
þere be ony þing to take awei þerof as akynge ouþer ony strictture,
ouþer ony byndyng, þan remeue awey þat first in þe manere as it schal be

waische þe lyme wiþ a decoccioun of malowis & violet & rotis of bismalue
in watir, saue his lyme schal be in þe water no lenger þan it bigynneþ
for to bicome reed & sumwhat to swelle, & be war þat his lyme be not so

clooþ & frote it a litil wiþ þin hond, & þanne take a litil smal ȝerde &
bete þe lyme þerwiþ til þou drawe blood þerto, & make a plastre þerto in

drawe it awey, & so lete þe lyme be til amorowe, & þanne reherse þe
waischinge þat is forseid & þe froting & þe beting. Þis wiþouten ony
drede wole bringe  aȝen to his greetnes as it schulde be, but
if þe lyme be out of ioynct & haue be longe tyme, þan it wole be hard,
þan it is yuel to make þe lyme greet aȝen as it schulde. & þouȝ it mowe
not be maad greet as it schulde be, neþeles bi þis maner it may be myche

 If a mannes lyme is gretter þan it schulde be, if þe cause þerof be of

Or take þe leues of lilie celestie & grynde hem wel and þanne leye it

Everi enpostym is engendrid of .iiij. humouris, ouþir of water, or of

 Of fleume þere ben ij. kyndis, oon is natural & þe toþer innatural 
Natural fleume is coold & moist & whit, & goiþ sumwhat to swetnes,

A general word of empostyms 

Apostyme haþ manie diuers names of diuers men, for lewid cirurgians
 seien, þat þer is noon
apostym but þat, þat makiþ quytture  Saue I seie, & alle auctouris
seien þat eueri swellyng in a lyme, wheþir it be greet or smal, it schal
be clepid apostym  For .A. seiþ: litil swellyngis schule be clepid
litil apostyms, & grete swellyngis schulen be clepid grete apostyms 
Þerfore apostym is seid swellyng in lymes, ouþir inflatioun  þat chaungiþ þe lyme oþer þan it schulde be; & þe mater
herof comeþ of manie diuers þingis; ouþer it comeþ of humouris, or of
watir,  or of wijnd  If it comeþ of humouris, þan it comeþ
of blood, ouþer of fleume, or of colre, or of malancolie  Also
enpostyms þat cometh of humours: summe comeþ of natural humours, & summe
of innatural; & summe of sengle humours, & summe of humouris medlid
togidere  And summe enpostyms cometh of causis wiþinneforþ, & summe of
causis withoutforth  Þe causis wiþoutforþ is falling ouþer smiting, or
of a wounde, or chaunging of eir  Of þe causis wiþinneforþ: as of
wickidnes of humours, or to ful of humouris, or to ful of water, or of
wijnd  or whanne a man is hurt wiþoutforþ: or wiþ greet hete þat
brenneþ, or wiþ greet cooldnes of eir þat constreyneþ, or of greet
drienes þat constreineþ, for alle þese causis humouris gaderiþ togidere
& makiþ enpostyms  Also if a man falle vpon a stoon or vpon an hard
þing, or if a man be smite wiþ a stoon or wiþ a staf, or þoruȝ prickyng
of a venimous beest: alle þese þingis moun engendre venimous  enpostyms  In þis maner þou  schalt knowe


      

diuers enpostyms of what humouris þei comeþ  If superfluite of blood
drawe to a lyme, as is clepid flegmon,  & þes ben þe signes
þerof: þe place wole be reed for lijknes of blood, akynge for þe greet
replecioun þerof, beting  for þe greet depnes of mater, or for greet akynge  He may
haue greuaunce of a feuer  : rede rednes comeþ of þe colour of
blood, hardenesse comeþ of multitude of matiere & of hete þat wastiþ
watry matiere, quappinge & lepinge  of ventosite
& fumosite, schuftynge & puttinge, sore ache of þe 
strecchinge of þe place; hete comeþ of hote matiere, & swellinge comeþ
of multitude of matiere."]  If þe blood be þinne in substaunce & hoot
in qualite, þan it makiþ herisipulam. & þis is þe signe þerof, þat in þe
hiȝest place þerof, it wole be moost reed and hoot; & if þou leist þi
fyngir þeron, & whanne þou remeuyst þi fyngir, þe skyn wole be whit þere
þi fyngir was, & anoon it wole bicome reed aȝen, for þe mater þerof is
subtil, & þe pacient haþ greet brennyng þerof & akynge  Blood in his
owne substaunce is more gretter & makiþ more hete, & makiþ apostym, þat
is clepid carbunculus  Þis enpostym comeþ to a man whanne he haþ
haboundance of greet blood, & þerfor whanne he is replete of mete, he
schulde baþe him or traueile him-silf, þat þe blood miȝte falle out, &
for his greetnes & hardnes it mai not be  resolued with
hete, & þanne it leueþ in þe skyn & makiþ apostym.  Þe signes herof ben þes: þe enpostym is hard
for þe þiknes of blood, & þe colour þerof is swart reed for þe greet
hete, & þe greet heete  herof makiþ a man sumtime to
haue a feuer þerwiþ; & sumtyme it makiþ a man to haue sincopin,  & þis is speciali whanne þe matere is
brent, & in þis maner þe matere þerof is turned into venym 


      

Natural colre makiþ herisipulam,  & þe signe
þerof is hardnes for þe greet drienes of colre. & þe heed of þe enpostym
is schape as it were a pyne, for þe grece þat it haþ.  & þe colour þerof is reed medlid wiþ ȝelow 

An enpostym þat comeþ of fleume, is clepid vdimia  or ȝima,  & is a neisch enpostym, & þe colour þerof is sumwhat whiȝt. &
if þou pressist in þi fyngir, þer wole leue þere a pitt for þe gret
neischenes; & whanne þi fyngir is aweie, it wole arise vp aȝen. Þis
enpostym is wiþout akynge, saue it makiþ a greuaunce 

 Natural malancoli makiþ an hard enpostym, & is clepid Sclirosis.  & þe signe þerof is hardnes, & þe colour þerof is as þe
colour  of malancolie ledi or blac 

Enpostym þat comeþ of blood & watir medlid togidere. Þis is þe signe
þerof: if þou settist þeron þi .ij. fyngris of þi .ij. hondis, & first
pressist þat oon fyngir & þanne þat oþer, þou schalt fele þe watri mater
remeue fro þat oon fyngir to þat oþer 

 Þese ben þe differencis of apostyms þat ben symple, þat comeþ of oon
matere at oonis; & þese ensaumplis ben schewid tofor, for þou schalt þe
bettir knowe enpostyms þat comeþ of double matere 

 Þer comeþ an empostym of blood & colre; & if þe more partie be of
blood, þan þe enpostym schal be clepid flegmonides; & if þe more partie
þerof be of colre, þanne he schal be clepid herisipilades. & þe signes
herof þou schalt knowe bi þe signes of


      

þe symple apostyms   Also blood & fleume natural   medlid togidere, & makiþ an enpostym þat is vdimia. & þe signe
herof   þat þe heed of þis enpostym is reed, & þat
oþere wole be whit   
Also blood is medlid wiþ greet fleume & malancolie, & engendriþ
glandulas & Scrophulas.   Colre medlid with
fleume  makiþ fleume rennyng, & makiþ þat fleume goiþ wiþ
him into ioynctis. & herof þou schalt haue a pleyner teching in þe
chapitre of ioinctes.  Also greet fleume is medlid with malancoli, &
þerof comeþ glandula & Scrophule  Also malancolie & blood, colre &
fleume ben medlid alle togidere & makiþ an enpostym þat is clepid
antrax; & þe malice þerof is diuers after euery humour. Saue if blood &
colre be feruent togidere & malancolie be malicious, þan þere falliþ
manie harde þingis þerto, as quaking of þe herte, & sincopis, & out of
hise wittis, & sumtyme deeþ. & þe signes herof ben greet hardnes of þe
enpostym, & þe schap þerof as it were a pyn, & greet akynge, & sumtyme
he schal not fele it. And þerfore .G. seiþ: hote apostyms, if þei be not
felid, ben incurable. & veynes þat ben þeron wolen be of diuers
colouris, & vpon þe enpostym þere wole be as it were a litil bladdre,
 & þe colour þerof wole be as aischis, & it semeþ þat it is
drawe ynward wiþ a þreed.  & þis enpostym is seid contagious.

Of humouris þat ben   natural, þese þingis  folowiþ þerof  Of
fleume þat is corrupt cometh Bocia & testudines  Of malancolie comeþ
scrophule & glandule, as it is aforseid. & of alle þese þou schalt haue
propre chapitris  Of colre þat is brent & of oþere humouris þat ben
brent & corrupt þere comeþ manie pustulis, & summe þerof ben ful
malicious after þe malice of þe matere  Herof comeþ ignis persicus,
miliaris, formica, herpes, herpes estiomenus.


      

Ignis persicus is a signe  þat þere ben
manie pustule þeron & venymous water. & þe pustule ben reed al aboute &
ȝelow, & occupieþ al þe lyme. & it is wiþ greet brennyng. & þis comeþ of
colre brent and þinne  Miliaris haþ litil pustulis, & haþ not so greet
brennyng, ne þe place þerof is not so reed. & þis comeþ ofte of fleume
medlid wiþ a litil colre   fformica is a pustula þat is swiþe
feruent, & haþ a cruste aboue, & it comeþ of colre brent. & þis is
goynge & fretiþ þe lyme aboue, & it hath greet brennyng   Þe firste
 is a pustula þat comeþ of malancolie & is blac or ledi, & it
comeþ of þe venemous mater of malancoli   Herpes estiomenus
is as miche to seie as fretyng him-silf, & þis comeþ in manie maners 
It comeþ in medlyng of colre þat is brent & malancolie innatural & brent
& sutil. & whanne þis falliþ into a lyme, it fretiþ þe lyme for þe greet
malice þat it haþ   Also þer is anoþer maner passioun þat haþ manie
diuers names, for summen clepen it cancrum, & summen lupum. & men of
fraunce clepen it malum nostre domine   And lumbardis clepen it fier of seint antony, & summen clepen it
herisipulam. Of alle þese diuers names is no charge of, saue þe signes
of þis sijknes ben þese: freting & brennyng & blac colour & stynkynge, &
þat riȝt foul stynkyng. & or þe skyn þerof be to-broke, it wole not
stynke, saue þe place þerof wole be ledi. & if þou felist þe place wiþ
þi fyngir, þou schalt fynde þe fleisch þerof al corrupt   Cancer is a
postym þat is swiþe corrupt. & is in .ij. maners: as cancer vlceratus, &
cancer þat is not vlceratus.  A cankre þat is not


      

vlceratus is in .ij. maners: oon comeþ of malancolie rotid, & bigynneþ
for to wexe in þe mychilnes of a fecche or of a pese. & þanne it  wole wexe alwei in a maner brennynge; & euere as þe matere wexiþ,
so wole þe brennyng wexe forþ. & it wole haue veynes of diuers colour. &
sum colour þerof wole be ledi, & sum wole be purpur, summe þerof wole be
grene. & þan þis is ful of colerik matere corrupt. & it haþ greet
akynge, & if þou pressist it with þi fyngir, þe malice þerof wole be
miche more  Þis passioun comounly wole wexe in placis þat ben
glandule  Þis maner enpostym comeþ ofte in a mannes þies & in a wommans
brest & in oþere placis  Cancer vlceratus. Alle þe signes þerof ben
tofore seid in his propre chapitre 

Now alle þe signes of enpostyms ben seid, go we to þe curis  Þou must
take kepe, wheþer þe enpostym come of causis wiþoutforþ or wiþinne  If
þe enpostym comeþ of causis wiþinneforþ, þanne þou must purge þe matere
or þou leie þerto ony repercussijf or ony maturatif or ony resoluyng
þing  forwhi a repercussijf  mai not do awei al þe
matere, þouȝ it sumwhat aswage þe akynge in þe firste bigynnyng 
neþeles itt makiþ þe matere hard, & aftirward þe patient 
schulde haue þe more penaunce  A resoluyng in an vnclene bodi drawiþ
more matere þerto þan it resolueþ.  A maturatif makiþ þe enpostym to
wexe more, if his bodi be vnpurgid, & makiþ þe matere of þe enpostym
feruent  In what maner þou schalt purge diuers maters, in þe chapitre
of allopucia þou schalt fynde it, & in þe chapitre de doloribus
iuncturarum, þat schal be seid here aftir  Þou schalt worche in
enpostyms þat falliþ in a mannes bodi wiþoutforþ. If þou wost wel þat
his bodi is replet, þis schal alwei be þin entencioun, for to drawe þe
matere awei in þis maner:  If þe enpostym be in a mannes mouþ, þan þou
schalt make him no gargarisme;  & if it be in his ers, þan þou
schalt make him no laxatif medicyn  & if it be in a wommans maris,
 þan þou schalt ȝeue hir no medicyn for to make
menstrue; saue þou schalt alwei go to þe contrarie herof: as if
enpostyms be in partijs aboue, þan þou schalt ȝeue catarticum  If þe
enpostym be bineþe, þan ȝeue


      

him medicyns for to caste.  Whanne þe matere is purgid, þan bigynne we
curis of hoot enpostyms  Þou must  be war of repercussiuis
in ten maners.  Þe j. cause is þis, if his bodi be replet  as it is
aforseid.  Þe .ij. is, greet fume of humours & venymous.  Þe .iij. is
gretnes  of humours rotid.  Þe .iiij. cause is,
if apostym wexe in a noble lyme as in a mannes eere, or in a wommans
tetis, or in þe rigge abouteforþ.  Þe .v. cause is: if þe enpostym be
in þe þrote, or nyȝ þe brayn, or in ony place nyȝ þe herte, or nyȝ ony
lyme þat norischeth   Þe .vj. cause is in a child.  Þe .vij. cause
is, if it be in an oold man.  Þe .viij. cause is if it be in a man þat
risiþ vp of sijknes.  Þe .ix. cause is if it be apostema creticum.
  Þe .x. cause is, if an enpostyme be in a
noble membre, & be putt fro þat place to anoþer.  In noon of þese .x.
causis, þou schalt make noon repercussif in hote enpostyms as þou schalt
fynde þe maner in þe antidotarie of repercussifs   To enpostyms of
blood, þou miȝt do medicyns repercussifs & dissolutiuis sotilly, so þat
þe firste bigynnyng

awei þe enpostym ne resolue him, saue he bigynneþ to quytture, þan þou
schalt do þerto medicyns maturatiuis, til it be wel quitturid.  Of

schalt fynde in þe antidotarie.  Whanne þe enpostym is quitturid &
sufficiently rotid, þis þou miȝt knowe whanne þe akynge is al aweie, &
whanne þe matere is neische þerof, & þan opene þe enpostym, þat þou
seest moost competent  Saue or þou opene ony enpostyms, þou must be
war of þus manie þinges:  Þe j. is, þou schalt opene noon enpostym or
he be perfitli rotid, but if þe enpostym rotid ony oþir lyme, or þat he

is þis, þat þou schalt be war, whanne þou openest  an
enpostym, þat þou hurte no senewe, ne no veine ne noon arterie. 
Þe .iij. cause is, þat þou schalt not avoide al þe mater at oon tyme, &
principali whanne þer is myche matere, & þe enpostym is greet  
Þe .iiij. is þis, þou schalt alwei opene þe enpostym in endelong þe lyme

 Pustule þat comeþ of humours corrupt as ignis persicus  & miliaris,  &  fformica  schal be purgid wiþ medicyns þat

Of empostyms of þe heed 

Thowȝ we han maad a general tale of enpostyms, neþeles apostym in eueri
lyme haþ diuers curis  Þerfore I wole make to euery


      

enpostym a diuers chapiter   I seie þat in þe skyn of a mannes heed
ben diuers enpostyms  If þere be  enpostym þerof sutil
fleume, ful of fleume as it schal be seid heraftir in þe chapitre of
bocium   Þis maner sijknes
is engendrid bitwene þe skyn & the fleisch, & it is suwhat holowȝ, &
ben clepid testudines for þe lijknes of a beest þat is clepid so, & ben
engendrid of hard fleume, & ben, as it were, hard knottis þat were maad
fast to þe scolle, as it were hornis  For I seie a man came to me, & he
hadde in his heed vij. suche maner þingis in diuers placis, & summe
þerof weren as longe & as scharp as it were a gotis horn or þe lenkþe of
a mannes þombe, & þei weren greuous to þe man, & I hadde miche wondre
þat þer were noon vlcera in þe skyn  Whanne I siȝ wel þat þei hadden
her bigynnynge of þe scolle boon, I  wolde not entermete
þerwith of þe cure, & I counseilide him þat he schulde putte him into no
mannes cure for to cure him, for it þouȝte to me impossible.

 Þe curis of al þe enpostyms in þe heed, ben þese  If it be of neische
matere or of rotid matere, þan þou schalt not take hede for to drie it
wiþ mollificatiuis, þouȝ I seide so in enpostyms of fleume in þe general
chapitre; for þat myȝte schende  þe scolle wiþ liquid mater or corrupt matere.
& if þe matere þerof is hard, make it neische wiþ maturatiuis, saue lete
þou not it rotie to myche. & or it be rotid to miche, opene it in þe
maner of a triangle þus; for þis empostym of þe heed for þe gretnes of
þe skyn, and for it is ful of pooris, it mai not wel be clensid, but if
þe woundis were so miche þat þe mundificatif myȝte come to þe botme.
Whanne þe enpostym is kutt in þe forseid maner, þanne avoide þe mater &
fille þe place al wiþ pecis wet in oil of rosis, & sugre molten þeron, &
alym & leie þis in þe botme þerof til  þe place be wel maad
clene. Aftirward wiþ vnguentum apostolorum & oþere þingis þat engendriþ
fleisch, cure him as it is forseid in þe cure of vlcers þat ben olde 
 Nodus is curid wiþ kuttyng of þe skyn endelongis vpon þe place & drawe
him out wiþ alle hise rotis. & if þer leueþ ony rote of him, þan leie
þeron þe poudre of affadillorum, or of sum


      

liȝt corosif or vnguentum viride, þat þe rotis þerof mowe frete awei
þerwiþ; & þan regendre & þan drie it vp  Watir þat is gaderid in
children hedis,  ouþer it is wiþinne þe scolle or wiþoute þe scolle 
If it be withynne þe scole, it semeþ to me so perilous, þat I wole
bitake þe cure to god  If þe watir be withoutforþ, it mai be curid wiþ
anointing of oile of camomille & solfre grounden togidere; & þanne make
him .iij. cauterijs: oon a litil aboue þe forheed, & oon bihinde þe
nolle in þe welle  þerof, & oon aboue þe
hindere celle. Þese cauterijs wiþ þe forseid anoyntingis drieþ & waastiþ
þe matere of þe watir   Þe water þat comeþ in children hedis, is
engendrid in þis manere  whanne  þe maris of a womman is
watri, & þe child þat lijþ þerine lijþ foldyng adounward his heed vpon
hise knees. & þan þe moisture falliþ adoun & fyndiþ a void place in þe
childis heed & entriþ þerinne  & þis passion makiþ a child deed ofte,
or he haue ony age for to be holpen 

 Of enpostyms of þe rootis of a mannes eeris 

Apostyme þat comeþ in a mannes eere or in þe rotis of a mannis eeren. &
þis comeþ sumtyme in die cretico, whanne þat a mannes kynde is not so
miȝti for to putte out þe gretnes of þe mater bi sote ne bi noon oþer
avoiding, & þan kynde worchiþ what it mai, & driueþ þe matere an hiȝ to
þe heed & abidiþ in þe rotis of þe eeren, & þere it engendriþ apostym. &
in þis place it is perilous, for it is so nyȝ þe heed & veynes &
arterijs & neruys  Þis manere enpostym ofte sleeþ a man whanne þe
matere comeþ violently  Þe matere of þis enpostym, ouþer it is colre,
or blood, or fleume, or malancoli; & alle þe signes herof ben aforseid 
Þe cure of  þis enpostym mai not bigynne with repercussiuis,
saue it mote bigynne wiþ mitigatiuis, & with þingis þat puttiþ out þe
matere  Waische þe place wiþ a decoccioun of camomille soden þerinne 
& þanne aftir þat anoynte þe same place with oile of camomille, & þan
wete wolle in þe same oile & leie þervpon, & bi no maner leue þou not
þat þou leie in his eere oile of bittir almaundis, for it is a greet
help   If þe mater be deep & it be hard for to drawe it out, þan it
were good to sette vpon þe place a drie ventose


      

for to helpe to drawe out þe matere, & aftir resolue þe matere & leie
þerto mitigatiuis for to do awei þe akynge   If þe matere wole not be
resolued in þis maner, saue it bigynneþ to be quitture þeron, þan wiþ
tempere maturatiuis þat ben not to hote, make þe enpostym quitture 
Whanne þe place is wel rotid abide þou no brekyng of þe enpostym, saue
opene þe place sotilly wiþ an instrument þat is competent þerto  & þou
muste be wel war þat þou touche no veyne, ne noon arterie, ne no senewe,
for þerof miȝt come  myche perel, for þere ben nerues in þe

for euere  & if þere were ony veyne kutt þerof, þer miȝt come greet
perel þerof. & whanne þe place is opened, þan make þe place clene wiþ
mundificatiuis, þat schulen be seid in þe antidotarie  & whanne þe
place is perfitli clene, þanne make þe fleisch wexe & do þe cure
perfitli  For bi yuel curyng in þis place miȝt engendre a festre, þat
ofte tyme comeþ of an enpostym 

Apostyms of þe necke and of þe þrote 

Apostyms þat ben in þis place, or it is wiþoutforþ in þe senewis, or in

Þe humours þat ben in þe cause,  þou schalt knowe

worching is not sure, for in þis maner manie men dieþ, & þe deeþ comeþ
not of þe sijknes, saue it is defaute in þe leche   Þis maner sijknes þat is so hid

lete him blood in þe veine þat is clepid basilica, & if þe patient haþ

lete him blood in þe middil veyne of þe arm þat is clepid mediana, & he

& ful of fleisch  In þe .ij. dai þou schalt lete him blood in þe veines
vndir þe tunge  & loke þat þou do no þing aftir her counseil þat seien
þat in þe firste bigynnyng þou schalt lete him blood in veines vndir þe

manere leting blood, if his bodi were replet, he miȝt liȝtli be

saue a þing maad of wheete-bran in þis maner   Take newe bran of whete & caste þeron hoot water &

leie wolle vnwaischen,  & make a sutil plastre of a

Whanne þe enpostym is rotid; þat þou schalt knowe bi þe aswaging of þe

lete him vse þis gargarism til al þe matere be drawe out, & þan after

forseid wiþ þingis þat voidiþ þe matere & wiþ resoluynge þingis.  I
wole sette in þis place a cure þat bifel in þe citee of mediolanensis of
a ladi þat was .L. wynter oold, & hadde a squinacie of fleume þat
occupiede al hir necke tofore wiþinne & wiþoute,


      

 saue wiþoutforþ þe swelling was moost, & þe womman miȝte
not speke, ne swolowe in no mete. & þis womman was vndir þe cure of a

was in dispeir of hir lijf, I was sent after & foond hir in wickide

was so greet  & þan I took a rasour, & lokide where þe matere was moost
gaderid for to engendre quitture, & it was moost able vndir þe chyn, & I
felide þe place wiþ myn hond & tastide it aboute þat I miȝte be war of

þe stynking wente awei þerwiþ, & þe womman bigan to be stronger, &
whanne þe wounde was maad clene I driede it vp & soudide it; & in þis
maner þe pacient was maad hool.  Whanne þou fyndist coold matere rotid
in þe forseid placis, þou schalt not abide til þe enpostym breke him-

þan make it more maturatif, & opene it as it is aforseid  And þis þou
muste wite þat þou miȝte  not abide to longe wiþ þe openyng:
for þe herte & þe spiritual lymes ne mowe not longe endure wiþouten eir.


      

 Of enpostym of subcilio  

This maner of enpostym haþ no nede of repercussiuis for causis þat ben
aforseid, saue it is  greet nede þat he be avoidid wel
wiþ purgaciouns  And if þe enpostym be hoot, þou schalt lete him blood
in a veyne þat is clepid vena nigra,  or in þe veyne þat is
clepid basilica in þe arm. & if þe matere be coold, þan avoide þe matere
wiþ medicyns maad of turbit or sum oþer medicyn þat falliþ þerfore. & as
myche as þou miȝt þou schalt take þerto wiþ medicyns þat haue not to

drawing, þan þe enpostym wole wexe þe more  Þerfore þou schalt anoynte
him wiþ oile of camomille, & leie þervpon wolle vnwaischen. & his
dieting schal be sotil. & if þis suffise not, þan leie vpon a
maturatif  & whanne it is rotid þou schalt opene  it, &
principali if it be of coold matere. Saue if  þere be glandule þeron, as it falliþ ofte, & it be not
ouir al rotid, as in oon place hard anoþir place neische, þan þou schalt
haue þis in certein, þat þis passioun schal be clepid bubo, & þe cure
þerof is hard.  For if þou drawist out þe matere þat is
neische,  þe matere þat is hard is yuel to defie. & ofte
þer comeþ þerof sclirosis or a festre, & it wole make a man yuel
disposid & feuerous, as G. seiþ.  & þerfore aswage þe akynge & þan make rotyng wiþ
maturatiuis; for þe matere þat is rotid wole helpe to rotie þe matere
þat is hard. & whanne it is al neische þanne opene it  If it so be þat
it breke bi it-silf or it be ful rotid, þan do þerto mundificatiuis, &
vpon þe place þat is hard leie maturatiuis, & kepe wel þe place þat is
open fro festrynge. Mundificatiuis & maturatiuis þou schalt fynde in þe
antidotarie pleynlier.


      

An enpostyme of þe helpers  

This enpostym if it be hoot, þan lete him blood in þe arm aforȝens, &
not in þe same side in þe veyne þat is clepid basilica, & þan þou muste
surely leie þerto repercussiuis,  & if repercussiuis
suffisen not, þan resolue it & leie maturatiuis þerto, & þan abide til
it be perfitli  quitturid, but if þe matere be so
violent þat it were in poynt  to schende þe lyme, þan opene it & be wel war of the braun
þat is in þat place  Manie men þat ben vnkunnyng & supposen þat place
to be fer fro ony noble lyme,  makiþ þeron a deep
kuttyng, & supposiþ to haue gret worschip þerof; & manie idiotis wolen
preise hem 
wel þerfore. & þan þe lacertis þerof ben hurt; & whanne þe lacertis ben
soudid aȝen, þan þe lyme þat it seruede fore schal be contract, wherfore
þe mannes arm mai be lost in sum partie or in al  Þerfore whanne þou
wolt kutte þis enpostym, þou schalt but kutte abouteforþ in þe skyn, &
not to depe bi no maner wei for drede of þe braun, & of senewis, & of
veynes & arterijs, & whanne þe place is opened, þan leie þerto
mundificatiuis. If þe openyng be nyȝ þe elbowe, & þouȝ þe enpostym be
moost quitturid, þere be wel war þat þou opene not þe enpostym aboue þe
elbowe .iij. fyngris brede, neiþer  wiþinne ne wiþoute. &
also nyȝ þe poynt of þe elbowe it is perilous, for it is gret hap if it
be euere soudid. & þouȝ it be soudid, þe mouynge of his arme schal be
lost. If þer falle ony enpostym in þis place, & it come of greet matere
so þat his bodi be replet, þan he mote haue greet avoidyng wiþ
laxatiuis, & þan resolue þe matere, and worche as it is aforseid in þe
general chapiter. In þe same maner þou schalt cure þe enpostym of his
armis & of hise hondis.

 Panaricium  is an enpostym þat is in þe heed of
a mannes fyngir aboute þe nail  & is swiþe hoot, & greuous, & reed, &
ful of fier, & sumtyme it makiþ a man to haue þe feuere, & sumtyme it
fretiþ awei al þe poynt of a mannes fyngir  Þe firste cure of þis
enpostym is, þat first þou schalt lete him blood, so þat alle þingis


      

falle þerfore as elde & strenkþe & custum. & þan þou schalt make him an

þervpon scabiose grounden wiþ grese & do þe cure þerto, as þou schalt

Of an enpostym apperinge in þe mouþ of þe stomac 

Whanne þere schewiþ an enpostym in þe mouþ of þe stomac & aboute þe

& loke þat þei be not medlid wiþ no þingis þat ben repercussif; for if
þou leidist repercussiuis vpon þe stomak, or  þe lyuere, or

Þou schalt avoide þe matere, & þou schalt comforte þe place with

of þis enpostym, for it wole liȝtli turne in to selirosym, & þan it wole

Þerfore if þou seest  þat þe enpostym bicome hard,
þan þou muste leie þerto mollificatiuis & wiþ comfortatiuis. & þou muste

Apostym of þe ȝerde & ballokis 

Riȝt as enpostyms comeþ in oþere lymes, riȝt so þei comen in a mannes

 A coold empostym þat is in þe ballokis schal be curid wiþ anoynting of
þe matere wiþ medicyns or wiþ scharpe suppositorijs; for þis drawiþ þe

The cure of scrophularum & glandulum  

Cure of glandularum & scrophularum is almoost oon, saue herof is a

 Þe cure of þe cancre not vlcerid & his cure 

Causis & difference þou hast herd of a cankre  & in what

If it so be þat þe cancre be perfit & greet, þan þou schalt touche him

Bocium þat comeþ of humours corrupt.

Bocium is a postym þat comeþ of humours, & principali it is engendrid of

whanne þei ben rotid & not opened. & þouȝ þe subtil mater be drawen out,

Sum maner þerof is lijk as it were cley, & summe is lijk schellis. Summe

enpostym in his corrupcioun takiþ manie diuers colouris 

Þis enpostym schal be helid wiþ drawynge þingis & wastynge þat schulen

 Of þe akynge of ioynctis.

Now it is seid pleynlier of alle enpostyms, now speke we of passiouns
þat comeþ in ioynctis. & þis passioun is myche lijk to enpostyms in
causis & signes & curis, & also it diuersiþ miche fro oþere enpostyms 
For þouȝ þe place be greet to-swollen, it comeþ but late or neuere to
quitture. Swellynge & akynge of ioinctis, þis passioun is vnknowen to
manie kunnyng lechis þat han greet name. Bi þe cause þat cirurgians ben
clepid algate to þis manere passioun, þerfore I haue studied to make a
general chapitre of passiouns of ioinctis. & I haue take miche þerof þe
bokis of Rasis & of myn owne worching þat I haue proued.  Þe causis þat
makiþ akinge in ioynctis: or it comeþ of yuel complexioun of lymes, or
it comeþ of hoot complexioun þat hetiþ, or it comeþ of coold complexioun
þat cooldiþ  Drie ligaturis of ioynctis constreineþ & makiþ akynge,
 & moistnes makiþ neuere akynge wiþouten oþer  mater  Mater þat makiþ akinge of ioyncts is ofte tyme
haboundaunce of blood, & ofte tyme it is raw fleume, & moost principali
colre or blood medlid with fleume  & it comeþ ful seelde of fleume, but
if it be medlid wiþ ony oþer þing as colre  In what


      

maner þou schalt knowe which humour be in þe cause of akynge of
ioinctis, þou schalt finde in þe chapitre of allopucia & in þe general
chapitre of enpostyms, if þou takist good kepe of þe signes of þe
forseid chapitris, what humour is in cause of akynge of ioinctis  Saue
þis þou muste take hede, þat ofte tyme raw fleumatik humouris makiþ
akynge of ioinctis as it is forseid, & þan þe colour of þe lyme schal be
but litil  chaungid þerfore  & þan a leche but
if he be þe more expert þeron mai be bigilid. & sumtyme a litil quantite
of colre wole schewe vpon þe lyme, & þan þe leche wole leie þerto coolde
þingis, & þan þe mater of fleume wole bicome hard, & so þe greuaunce
wole be worse þan it was  Þerfore it is greet nede þat þe leche be
kunnyng & knowe wel þe  mater of passiouns of ioyntis.

 Þe cure of akynge of ioinctis þat comeþ of yuel complexioun oonly, þou
schalt remeue with þingis þat ben contrarie to þat complexoun:  as if þe mater be hoot,
þan þou schalt remeue it with colde þingis, & if þe mater be coold, þan
þou schalt remeue it wiþ hoot þingis, & if þe mater be of drienes, þan
þou schalt remeue it wiþ moist þingis, & wiþ metis & drinkis þat makiþ
fatt, & wiþ rest  & wiþ gladnes; for as faste as his bodi
bicomeþ fatt, he schal be hool of þat passioun  Þis passioun þat comeþ
of humours, is curid with mitigacion of þe akynge, & I fynde diuers
opiniouns þeron  & þerfore I wole schewe hem in þis chapiter  Auicen

avoide him, & auicen forbediþ þat  In what maner schulen we
worche þanne, whanne þou fyndist a man þat haþ greet akynge?  First þou
schalt leie a plastre to þe lyme þat it be mitigatif or an oynement þat

Also þou miȝt ȝeue him sumwhat bi þe mouþ for to aswage þe akynge. & þou
schalt fynde greet plente in þis chapitre of defensiuis & mitagatiuis to
defende þe mater  And whanne þe akynge is perfiȝtli swagid lete him blood


      

if þe cause be of blood. & if it be of anoþer cause avoide it. & if þou
letist him blood, þou schalt do it in a lyme aforȝens. & if þou wolt
avoide þere matere, loke þat þou knowe þe cause  for þis is ful

 Of sciatica passio   ."]

Akynge of haunchis schal be curid wiþ avoidinge of þe mater id est

is in þe depnes of þe lyme, &  ne mowe
not come þerto. Resolutiuis


      

ben not þerfore, for þei mai not come to þe depnes of þe mater. & for þe
mater is so greet, it schulde more drawe to þe place humouris þan
dissolue. Saue þou must aswage þe akinge, & þou schalt do awei þe akynge
with oile & hony & fatnes þat doiþ awei  akinge.  If
þe mater come of blood, þan lete him blood in a veyne þat is clepid
basilica in þe same side, & in þe secunde dai lete him blood in a veyne
þat is clepid sciatica, & principaly if þe mater descende adoun
wiþoutforþ toward þe foot, for þan it mai principaly be holpen  If þe

Saue herof þou schalt take kepe þat bifore his purgacioun bineþe forþ

he schal haue a vomet. For if þou make him a medicyn laxatif bineþeforþ
& no vomet tofore, þan it wole drawe more þe mater toward þe place þan

medicyn laxatif  And þerfore medicyns laxatiuis summe ben propre for
akynge of þe haunchis, as coloquintida, yrios, sarcocolla, 
centaurea, agaricus, & infusioun of aloes. For infusioun of aloes wole
make blood passe fro him at his sege, & þan þe akinge wole go awei & he
schal be hool  & whanne he is perfitli maad clene wiþ medicyns

hoot, & make herof a plastre, & leie it vpon as hoot as þou maist

camedrios & centaurea  is good
þerfore, for it wole drawe awei bi vryne   Item: cauterijs maad in þe

þat his bodi is maad clene with purgaciouns, & tofore þou schalt make
him no cauterijs.

Of þe maner of dieting of hem þat han passions in ioinctes 

In what maner þou schalt diete men þat han passiouns in iointis. Þou
schalt wite þat þer is no þing so greuous to þis passioun as is wyn, &
it is principali forbede in an hoot cause, & so it schal be in a coold
cause; for whanne it is take, it persiþ liȝtli to þe iointis, & makiþ
wei to þe mater for to falle þerto  Saue if þe passion be coold, & þe
patient mai not wel  defie his mete, þan þou schalt graunte
him a litil wijn, & not to miche for þe causis þat ben forseid.  In an
hoot cause make him drinke þat is forseid in þe chapiter of dieting of
woundis, or he schal vse vinum granatorum wiþ coold water. & þe pacient
schal absteine him fro fleisch & fisch & vse lactucis, portulacis  & if
he be gretli feble, þan þou schalt ȝeue him litil chikenys. & lete þou
not him drinke wijn bi no maner if his passioun be hoot  & whoso haþ þe
coold passioun herof, he schal holde him wel apaied  for to ete oonys
adai & not to miche. & lete him drinke ydromel wel soden  for if he mai

but if he haue wil þerto.

Now wolen we make a tretice of passioun of lymes þat falliþ for no

schalt fynde þat þe iȝen ben maad of .iij. cotis or of .iiij. or
of .vij. or of .x., & alle þei seien sooþ. Saue þe .j. coote þat maketh
þe schap of þe iȝe, ben but .iij. þat scheweth out in þe hole of þe iȝe,
& þerfore me mai seie .vj. & also þre   And fro þe brain tofore comeþ .ij.
bindingis þat ben not of nerues, saue þei ben of þe substaunce of brain,
& þat oon comeþ out in þe riȝtside, & þat oþer in þe liftside, & ben
schape as it were þe hedis of .ij. tetis, wherbi þe witt is take.  & after þese .ij. comeþ out ij.
nerues, & ben fast to þe iȝen, & ben schape in þis maner:


Þan þat nerue þat wexiþ in þe riȝtside of þe brayn, whanne he goiþ out
of þe scolle boon & entriþ into orbitam, þat is þe holow place þat þe
yȝe sitt on, & goiþ to þe iȝe in þe liftside. & bi þes nerues comeþ þe
spiritis of lijf & of siȝt to þe yȝen  Of þe substaunce of dura matris
is engendrid rethina, þat is þe þinne skyn þat goiþ without þe iȝe, þat
is clepid þe vilm of þe iȝe. And þis serueþ of greet seruice, & þis vilm
was maad swiþe þinne þat it ne hurte not humouris, & þat it lette not þe
meuynge of þe iȝe, and it  byndiþ in al þe iȝe, & it
defendiþ þe iȝe fro harmynge of þe boon  

 Þere comeþ manye sijknessis in þe iȝen, & summe comeþ of causis

 &

ordelus, grando, nodus, & pilus, fistula lacrimalis.  Also þer ben
oþere manere sijknessis of þe iȝen: as blind & hurtinge þat mowe not be
curid 

It is forseid what þing is enpostym in þe general capitulo of enpostyms.
& it is forseid þat euery þing þat gaderiþ humour togidere & makiþ
swellynge,   schal be
clepid enpostym   In þe same maner obtalmia
 is clepid enpostym of þe iȝe. & þere
ben .iij. maners of obtalmia: as liȝt, & strenger, & alþer strong. Liȝt,
as whanne a mannes iȝe bicomeþ reed & haþ brennynge þerinne & prickinge,
& þer is no swellynge þeron. & þis mai come of a cause withoutforþ: as
of hoot eir or of coold, or of smoke, or of poudre, or of wakinge, or of
traueile. & þe cure herof is but liȝt; for þis sijknes mai be curid in
þis maner. Take þe white of an ey & scume  it, & loke þat þere falle no
filþe þeron, & leie it into his iȝe; for þis is þe best medicyn  among
alle medicyns þat ben clepid colliries, for it wole make coold his iȝe &
do awey þe akynge. & it abidiþ þe lenger in his iȝen, for it is
viscous   If þe cause be cold,  þan þis cure suffisiþ: þanne
lete him drynke a litil sutil wijn, & make him a fomentacioun of rosis &
flouris of camomille, & fenigrec soden in water. & if þis suffise not,
þan  þou muste lete him blood, & avoide awei þe humouris. &
þou muste caste into his iȝe a whit collirium, & it is seid in oþere
spicis of obtolmia.

 Obtolmia þat is strong. Þese ben þe signes þerof: greet reednes, & þe
veynes of þe iȝen be ful replete, & þe corner of þe iȝe schal watri, &
he schal haue greet akinge & pricking, & sumtyme þere comeþ in þe first

þan lete him blood in þe heed-veyne  þat sitt in þe

him blood þe quantite after his elde & after his strenkþe; or sette a
ventuse vpon his schuldris, & þat is more better, for þe mater comeþ
more  of blood þan of colre. & þat þou miȝt knowe bi þe
signes of blood þat ben forseid   And if þe mater come of colre, þat
þou miȝt knowe bi greet akinge & scharp, & litil swellinge. & þe mater
wole be ȝelow aboute hise iȝen. & he schal haue but litil reednes. & þan
þou schalt lete him blood in lasse  quantite þan  if þe mater come of blood. & blood leting is good in þis caas, for
þe scharpnes of colre mai be take awei wiþ þe blood leting. & þan þou
schalt purge him wiþ a decoccioun of fruitis with mirabolanis þat ben
forseid in þe chapitre of allopucia. & if colre be medlid wiþ ony partie

& whanne þe reednes & swellyng of his iȝe is aweie, he mote be war of

The signes of vlcera þat pustula comeþ þerof ben þese: grete akingis þat

Of þe passioun of eeris.

As it is aforseid þat nerues comen fro þe brain to þe iȝen  in þe same
maner nerues comen from þe brain & goiþ into þe eris & makiþ heerynge &
ben instrumentis of witt.  Þe hoolis in a mannes eeris ben
maad in a deep holowe boon, & it was bi þis skille þat it schulde
vndirstonde sownynge, & þat þe sowne schulde not come into þe brayn
anoon, but alitil & alitil bi degree, & also for þis skille þat þe coold
eire ne þe hoot eire schulde not sodeinly entre yn; & þe wei þat goiþ
into a mannes eere, ne goiþ not riȝt forþ, but hidir & þidir, for if þe
weie were riȝtforþ, it wolde þe raþere be hurt of al maner þing  Þe
eere was maad of cartilaginis þat is hardere þan fleisch & neischer þan
boon, þat it miȝte be pliaunt. & if þei schulde be maad oonly of
fleisch, þei schulde haue noon sustentacioun for to bere hem vp. & if
þei hadden be maad oonly of hard boon, þei miȝten not haue be meued, &
þerfore itt was moost nede þat þei weren cartilaginous: þat is as miche
to seie as maad of gristle þat is neischer þan boon & hardere þan
fleisch. To þis lyme þer comeþ manie sijknessis, & summe þerof falliþ
for cirurgie as apostimes & vlcera, & summe falliþ to phisik as greet
sownynge in þe eeris & sibillus, &  defaute of heeringe &

sumtyme harme fallynge þerto  & þerfore it is mi purpos for to speke
boþe of sirurge and of phisik in þis chapitre.  Alle þe sijknessis of
þe eeris moun be take in þis maner, as akynge of eeris. Ouþer it is
apostym & without vlcera, or it is wiþ enpostym & vlcera; þan it is of
yuel complexioun & hoot;  þat þou miȝt knowe bi scharp
akynge & reednes of þe place. & þan þou schalt cure it wiþ castynge into

þeron a litil of opium  And if it come of yuel complexioun þat it be
coold, as coold wynd or of coold eire entrid þeron, þis þou miȝt knowe
bi greet cooldnes in þe place, & þan þou schalt cure him wiþ þingis þat
schal be cast into þe eere, watir of maiorana, or oile of lilie, þat þou
schalt fynde þe composicioun in þe antidotarie. & in þis maner hoot oile
schal be putt in his eere &


      

no coold þing, & þou schalt stuwe þe pacient  Sumtyme it
comeþ of sum þing þat falliþ in his eere as a worme or a corn or a
stoon, or watir; þis þou schalt knowe bi þe tellinge of þe pacient; for
if þer be ony þing wiþinne, me mai se it. If it so be þat þer be falle
yn ony stoon, þan caste into his eere oile of rosis, or oile of
almaundis, & if þer be falle yn ony corn, þan þou schalt do noon oile in
his eere; for it wole make þe corn wexe greet. Make a litil instrument
of tree or of sum oþer þing & wete it in terbentyn & putte it into his
eere, & touche þerwiþ þe stoon, ouþir þe greyn, & þan it wole cleue
þerto, & þan drawe it out   Also smite his eere wiþ þe pawme of þin
hand, & bi hap it wole falle out þerwiþ  Also sette a ventuse wiþ fier
vpon þe hoole of his eere, for þis sumtyme wole drawe out a corn ouþer a
stoon.   If þer entriþ ony worme into a mannes eere, þan
fille his eere ful of flact watir,  & þan drie it  And if þis
suffisiþ not, fille his eere ful of oile of almaundis þat ben bittir; &
if þis suffisiþ not, þan do in his eere iuys of calamynte.

 If þe akynge come of humouris gaderid to apostym, þat þou 
miȝt knowe bi greet akynge, & akynge of his pous,  & bi þe swellynge of þe place, þan þou muste
bigynne for to aswage þe akynge wiþ oile of rosis, & lete him blood in
þe heed veyne in þe same side. If it so be þat he mai not be lete blood,
for sum cause þat lettiþ, þan garse him vpon his schuldris, & putte in
his eere oile of rosis wiþ a litil vinegre. If þee þinkiþ þat þe mater
comeþ of colre, þat þou schalt knowe bi signes þat ben forseid, þan
purge him wiþ a decoccioun of mirabolanorum  If þe mater be not
aswagid, ne þe akinge do awei, þan bigynne for to leie mussillaginis of

leie an enplastre þat it hile al þe eere, maad of lynseed, & barli, &
rotis of altea, & of lilie, & medle hem with gandris grese & grese of an

his eere, & þe


      

akynge aceesse.  & þan þou schalt cure it riȝt
as vlcera of þe eeris ben curid, þat schal be seid here aftir  Also if
þe mater þat makiþ þe enpostym come  of cooldnes, & þat
falliþ ful seelde, but if it come in an old man, & þat þou miȝt knowe bi
þe akynge & bi þe cooldnes of þe place, þan þou schalt bigynne to avoide
him wiþ pillulas cochie & wiþ a clisterie. & caste into his eere oile of
lilies, & resolue in þe same oile  .. euforbij ouþir .ȝ.
j. de turbit, & anoynte al aboute his eeris wiþ þe forseid oile of
lilies, & leie þer-vpon wolle vnwaischen, & make him a fumigacioun to
his eere wiþ hoot water in which schal be soden maiorana & calamynte. &
if þis suffisiþ not, leie þer-vpon an enplaster or an oynement, & of
garleke, & rotis of lilie soden to-gidere & grounden wiþ butter, & do
þerto leuayn, & do þerto oile of lilie or of camomille, & a litil
vinegre, & make an enplastre and leie vpon his eere, for þis enplastre
rotiþ coold mater & drawiþ it out, & if þou miȝt se ony place in þe eere
þat quitture is gaderid on, þan it is good to opene þat place & drawe
out þe quitture as it schal be seid heraftir. & þan þou schalt cure it

Sumtyme akynge of eeris comeþ of gret  wynd & sound in þe

  quod in vocum et tonorum
modulationem remanet absolutum: quare voces & toni inde magis exeunt
absoluti. 

In naso vel naribus plures concurrunt egritudines. Nam ibi fiunt
pustulæ, vlcera, caro superflua, polypus, cancer, fluxus sanguinis,
fetor, & olfactus priuatio.

Pustulæ fiunt vt plurimum ab adustis humoribus, et sunt cum punctura &
ardore. Et cura est phlebotomia & corporis euacuatio, et iniectio
albuminis oui cum oleo ros. in simul agitatis. Pustulis fractis, fiat
vnctio cum vnguento albo Rasis.

Vlcera quoque si calida fuerint, curantur eodem modo. Si frigida, cum
lauatione vini et mellis, & cum vnguento apostolorum, et cum vnguento
viridi dicendorum.

Caro superflua remouetur cum instrumentis chirurgicis; si non potest
tota cum instrumentis remoueri: remouetur residuum cum puluere
asfodillorum & cum vnguento viridi, & apostolorum, & cunctis
mundificantibus: & remotis superfluis cum unguentis solidantibus compleatur.

Polypus dicitur a polypo pisce: cuius malitiosa est astutia: quia quando
vult piscibus saturari, ascendit saxum quod est in litore maris: & ipsi
multum assimilatur, pisces fatigati videntes saxum, non aduertunt de
polypo propter similitudinem: sed volentes quiescere, salliunt de mari:
polypus illos absorbet: & in eius conuertit nutrimentum. Sic iste morbus
cum naso magnam habet affinitatem: quoniam eius materia est catarrhosa
frigida grossa descendens a capite: & in via propter eius grossitiem &
tenacitatem hæret naso seu substantiæ nasi inuiscata: et humores capitis
agitatione moti naturæ volentes descendere, & exire, materiam ibi
recipiunt congregatam:


      

quæ humores illos in suam conuertit malam naturam: et ex ipsa quotidie
augmentatur. Differentia vero est inter polypum & carnem superfluam:
quoniam caro superflua, non habet profundam tenacitatem cum nasi
substantia: nec cum ipso naso nimis assimilatur: immo potest de facili
segregari: polypus vero firmiter adheret cum naso: & non sine violentia
separatur. Quorum scilicet polyporum aliquis est curabilis: aliquis
incurabilis. Curabilis est substantiæ mollis & tractabilis: nec nasum
reddit durum: nec in colore nigrum seu fuscum: nec est multum supra
circa cerebri confinia inuiscatus. Incurabilis vero nasum reddit durum,
liuidum seu nigrum: & magnam profunditatem tenet, quam quanto magis
videris maiori nigredine maiorique participari duritie, maioremque
profunditatem occupare, tanto plus ab eo existima fugiendum: quoniam
naturam tunc tenet cancri: quanto plus eum curare niteris tanto plus
videbis eius malitiam augmentari.

Curabilis vero cura est secundum quod diximus in cura superfluæ carnis
quæ ibi consurgit cum ablatione sive cum instrumentis & cum vnguentis
mundificativis: & aliis quæ nouisti: præcedente semper corporis et
capitis purgatione: sicut multoties est ostensum. Cauteria quoque
secundum quod audies, multum valent ad polypi materiam consumendam. Eius
vero quem incurabilem diximus, non assumas curam. Si tamen rogaris
nimis, palliatiuam curam adhibe: sicut in cura cancri recolimus ostendisse.

Cap. iiii.

Totam vero oris concauitatem interius circundat panniculus qui continuus

quarum anatomiam superius habuisti; in earum summitate est epiglottis:
quæ est creata ad perficiendum vocem: et ut seruet aliquid de aere

viam canne pulmonis: & claudit viam oesophagi. Quare multoties accidit,

Of þe passioun in wommen brestis 

God almiȝti made in a womman tetis for þe norischinge of a child. & a
wommans tetis ben maad of fleisch þat is glandulous, & of veines, & of
arterijs, & of nerues, & ben but veines þat comen fro a wommans lyuere
to hir tetis & þe maris, as it is seid here tofore, & in what maner
blood turneþ into milk it is forseid. 


      

 In a wommans tetis comeþ manie passiouns  ffor, as Egidius seiþ, þat
sumtyme þer comeþ þerto apostym of milk, & sumtyme vlcera  And comounly
enpostyms comeþ of blood þat is drawe to þe tetis & mai not turne into
milk, or if a womman haue to miche blood, & it comeþ of febilnes of
vertu as it is aforseid in þe general chapitre of enpostyms.  Þe cure
of an hoot enpostym in þe tetis  ffirst þou  schalt lete
hir blood in Basilica, or sette a ventuse vpon hir schuldris. & if þe
cause come of retencioun of menstrue, þan þou schalt ȝeue hir medicyns
for to bringe out þe menstrue, or þou schalt lete hir blood in þe
sophene, & anointe þe place wiþ oile of rosis, & þe fourþe part of
vinegre. & if þis suffise not, þan wete a lynnen clooþ in þe iuys of
solatri,  &
whanne þou hast anoyntid þe place wiþ oile & vinegre, þan leie þis clooþ
þervpon. & loke þat alle þingis þat þou leist þerto be flasch hoot;
 for þer schal no coold þing
be leid þerto for þe place is neruous, for coold þing wolde greue it. If
alle þese medicyns suffisen not, saue þe mater bigynneþ to drawe to
quitture, þanne leie þerto maturatiuis. & if þou miȝt not do it awei wiþ
repercussiuis ne wiþ resoluynge þingis, & þou ne miȝt not make it
maturatif, þan it is drede lest þe womman bicome in a passioun þat is
clepid Mania.  Þan hir heed mote be schaue, & ȝeue hir
confortif þingis for hir heed, & ȝeue hir sotil dietynge, & sche schal
drinke no wijn ne ete  no fleisch. & þou muste worche ful
sotilli, ffor I say a womman þat hadde an enpostym in hir brest & come
of blood, & so I tauȝte hir for to do  as it is
aforseid, & þo þer come a lewid cirurgian & repreuede me, & he leide
þervpon maturatiuis: & þe more þat he leide þervpon maturatiuis, þe more
þe mater wexide greet & þe more brennynge. & þe same cirurgian wolde not
heere my counseil  & þe wommans freendis took more hede to þe lewid
cirurgian þan to me, & wiþinne .iij. daies Mania come to hir and was
oute of hir witt, & so þe frenesie fil on hir  & þis pronosticacioun I
seide in þe bigynnynge, but þei wolde not leue mi wordis   If it so be þat it make
quitture, þan opene it & do out þe quitture, & þan leie þerto a
mundificatif,


      

& be wel war þat þou putte þerinne no greet tent ne long, as manie
foolis doon; for a wommans tetis ben ful of nerues, & if þe nerues were
pressid wiþ ony tent, it wolde make gret akynge, & wolde lette þe cure
þerof.  Also þer ben manie foli lechis, whanne þei fynden 
in a wommans tetis fleisch þat is glandelous, þan þei wene þat it be
wickid fleisch, & ben þeraboute for to drawe it out, & þan þei schendiþ
al þe substaunce of þe brest. Þou schalt worche wiseli & þou schalt
remeue noon herof, for as it is aforseid, al þe fleisch of þe tetis is
glandelous. & whanne þat is clensid wiþ mundificatiuis þan þou schalt
regendre fleisch, & þan þou schalt drie it  If it be so, þat coold
mater gadere to enpostym in a wommans brest, & þat comeþ ful selde, loke
if þis mater come of fleume, & þan anoynte þe place wiþ oile of
camomille, & oile of lilie, & oile of anete, & a litil vinegre medlid
þerwiþ. & if it be ony nede first make hir a purgacioun, & if it resolue
not, þan leie þerto maturatiuis, & þan do as it is aforseid  & if it so
be þat þe mater turne to hardnes & blak or ledi, þan þou muste be war
þat þou leie þerto no medicyns þat ben to hoot, for þer mai engendre a
cancre þerof ful liȝtli. & if it be so, þan be þou not þeraboute for to
make it maturatif, & do þou no cure þerto. & summen seien þat a womman
mai be curid for  to kutte off al þe brest, & þat is al
fals. Saue þou schalt kepe þe place wiþ vnguentum de tutia, & sche mote
ofte be purgid, þat sche mowe lyue þe lenger.  I-leue þe wordis þat I

cure a verri cancre, but it were in a fleischi place þere I miȝte kut al

is ful of senewis & veynes & arterijs.  Vlcera þat ben in a wommans

herof þou muste be war þat þis lyme may not suffre so harde corosiuis
for þe greet tendirnes þerof, saue þou schalt do þerto medicyns þat ben
mundificatif & driynge  It falliþ to summe wommen þat þe point of hir

take it in his mouþ for to souke  In þis maner þou schalt helpe it 
Take þe cuppe of an acurne, & þat is lyk to þe point of a wommans tete,
& do þeron terbentyn or pich, & make it hoot & leie it vpon þe point of
hir tete & binde  it þerto faste, & þis wole drawe out þe
point of hir


      

tete.  Also it bifalliþ to maidenes þat her tetis bicomeþ more þan þei
schulde be bi resoun, & þou schalt helpe hem in þis maner  Take stonys
þat me whettiþ knyues on, & frote þese .ij. stones togidere in vinegre
longe, til þe vinegre bicome þicke þerof, & make it hoot & anoynte þer

Of hernia  of þe ballokis 

This siknes mai be seid in manie maners  In oon maner whanne a mannes
bowels falliþ into his ballokis leþeris, & þan it is clepid hernia
intestinalis  Or þer falliþ watir into þe same place as


      

it were a dropesie, & þan it is clepid hernia aquosa  Ouiþir þer comeþ

þer wexiþ fleisch aboute & is greet, & þan it is clepid hernia carnosa 
And sumtyme þer ben veynes þereaboute ful of malancolious blood & wele
be gret as it were notis, & þan it is clepid hernia varicosa  The
firste cause comeþ in þis maner: Dindimus, þat anathomia þerof is  forseid, wexiþ wide for sum moistnes þat falliþ þerto, so þat
ȝirbus, ouþer þe bowels falliþ adoun in þe same place; and þis maner is
ofte seen. Ouþer siphac is to-broke in þe flank wiþ oon of þe forseid
causis in þe chapitre tofore  & þoruȝ þe same breking þe bowels falliþ
adoun ouþir ȝirbus, & bitwixe dindimus & mirac þei fallen adoun into þe
ballok leþeris. & þis maner falliþ ful selden. Þis laste maner is
incurable wiþ ony medicyns, but wiþ kuttynge it mai be curid & sewid. &
who þat vsiþ sich maner boondis aforseid, but if it be in children & in
newe causis, it is al traueile in idil, & þe patient haþ greet penaunce
þerwiþ wiþouten ony profit.  The firste may be curid  & þe .ij. maner
is ful hard for to cure, & þerfore it is ful necessarie for a cirurgian
for to knowe alle þe maners herof & anathamiam as it is forseid lest he
falle in errour.  Þer ben manie men þat ben hardi for to entermete of
þese curis þat knowen not þe maner of þe sijknes ne þe diffence þerof, &
þerfore þei falliþ aldai in errour. & þe lasse good þat  þat
þei kunne, þe raþere þei wole entermete of sich an hard cause. & þis
cause is ful perilous  I haue seen manie wise men þat coude do þis cure
ful wel, & ȝitt þei wolde not entermete þerof  Þerfore þou muste take
consideracioun sotilli, where þe bowels falliþ adoun þoruȝ þe brekynge
of siphac ouþir þoruȝ dindimum, & þat þou schalt knowe in þis maner: 
In þe firste caas þe bowels or ȝirbus falliþ doun sodeinli wiþ
agreuaunce, & þan þou miȝt fele his bowels or ȝirbum in þe botme of þe
ballok leþir, & þan þer is but oon skyn to-broke, & þat is mirac. &
whanne þou wolt putte yn þe bowels aȝen, þou miȝt fele in what place þei
goon in. & whanne hise bowels ben ynne, þan lete þe patient stonde vp, &
hise bowels wolen falle out sodeinli aȝen, & þan þou miȝt fele in what
place þei comeþ out  In þe .ij. caas ȝirbus or þe bowels, or boþe comen
adoun alitil & alitil, & makiþ miche gurgulacioun, & þe wei þat þei
comeþ out is algate sumwhat greet in dindimo, & þat wole not be put yn
whanne þe bowels ben putt yn, saue  wiþ greet penaunce & in
longe tyme. & whanne þe bowels falliþ þoruȝ dindimum, he makiþ þe ballok
leþir neuere þe lengere, & þis is a good


      

knowinge: whanne þou hast take kepe of alle þese priuitees, þan þou miȝt
wite wherof þe cause is.  Whanne þe bowels falliþ adoun þoruȝ a
fissure, id est þoruȝ a brekynge, þan þou schalt not traueile forto
worche wiþ plastris & wiþ boondis þat ben forseid, but if it be in
children & in causis þat ben newe. & if þe brekynge be but litil, þan
þou miȝt make .v. cauterijs vpon þe skyn wiþoutforþ, so þat þe cauterie
perse mirac, for þat wole make an hard drowing vpon þe brekinge  & it
wole not suffre þat þe bowels schulen not falle adoun þoruȝ þat place,
so þat þe brekinge be but litil. If it so be þat þe bowels falle adoun
þoruȝ dindimum, þan men haueþ diuers curis. Summen leien a corosif vpon
þe ers wiþ dindimum, a medicyn corosif, til þe skyn wiþout be frete, til
þou mai se dindimum, & þan aftirward he fretiþ dindimum; & summen drawiþ
awei a mannes ballokis, and  summen drawiþ not awei, but bi
þe wei of þe corosif þe ballokis wolen rotie afterward   Also summen
maken punctual cauterijs in þe maner of a cros vpon dindimum, & þan
aftirward heliþ it vp  Summen kutten þe hiȝer skyn wiþ a cauterie,  & þei streyneþ dindimum, & þei bindiþ it
wiþ spago   Sum worchith in anoþir maner: first, þei kuttiþ þe skyn
aboue, & þan þei makiþ cauterium aboue vpon dindimum in summe partie, &
in sum parti þei leeueþ hool. & þis maner is lasse worse þan þe toþer
þat ben forseid  Summen ficchiþ .ij. nedlis in dindimum wiþ double

þervpon martencium, 
til al þe skyn þat was take wiþ þe nedelis be rerid an hiȝ. & oþer men
han diuers werkis þat I hadde not certeyn, for alle maners þat I heere
þerof ben disseyuable  For sumtyme whanne a man haþ miche traueilid
þoruȝ, þing þat he haþ do brekiþ aȝen, & þan it wole be worse þan it was
raþer. & among alle þe maners þat ben, þat is worst þat is doon wiþ
medicyn caustica, for medicyns caustica for þe grete venym & malice
 þat it haþ, makiþ greet akynge, & is cause to make an
enpostym in dindimo, and þoruȝ þe agreuaunce þat dindimo haþ, siphac mai
be agreued & diafragma. & fro diafragma it mai go  to
þe brayn, þat is þe welle of alle nerues, & so þe man mai falle in a
spasme, & þan he is but deed.  O þou wrecchid leche, þat for a litil money


      

puttist a mannes lijf in perel of deeþ  for þe lawe seiþ, it is better
þan ony gold or siluer, for þou for a litil money makist him in perel of
deeþ  For a man mai lyue vn-to þe tyme of his ende for þis passioun. &
þerfore I wole counseile to kutte no man  Saue bi my counseil þei
schulen make a ligature as it is aforseid in þe brede of .iiij. fyngris
of lynnen clooþ or of sendel,  as I haue tauȝt hertofore. & make þat enplastre
þat is forseid, & teche him good regimen & good dietynge  & þouȝ he be
not curid wiþ þis medicyn he schal lyue neuere adai þe lenger, ne þe
lasse while þerfore   I say .ij. men þat hadden þe passioun, & þat oon
was .lx. winter oold, & his bowels fel out as it is for seid, & it was
ful hard  to bringe hem in  aȝen, & I made
him sich a boond as it is aforseid & a plastre, & tauȝte in what maner
he schulde diete him-silf. & I seide to him if he louede his owne lijf
he schulde go to no man to kutte him. & he was glad of my counseil, & he
bar þe forseid bond & þe enplastre .ij. ȝeer contynueli, dai & nyȝt, &
wiþinne þat tyme he was hool, & ȝitt I wiste not wher he schulde be hool
or no  & þat oþir man was .xl. wintre oold, & þer fel so greet plente
out at his bowels, þat þei miȝte not be putt in aȝen, til þe pacient
were sett in a baþ. & þo I putte hem in aȝen  & I toolde of þe perel of
kuttynge, & he bad me make sich a boond, & I made him oon & þe enplastre
þat is forseid. & I tauȝte him how he schulde kepe him-silf, and how he
schulde diete him-silf. & wiþinne a litil tyme he come to me, & seide
þat he was almost hool, & þat he wolde were his boond no lenger. & þo I
repreuede him, & seide þat he schulde not be hool, but if he weride it
lenger  In þis maner þou schalt teche him for to kepe him-silf: he
schal algate were his boond & his plastre, saue if he haue greet
penaunce  þerwiþ whanne he goiþ to his bed aneuen he mai
vndo it  And he schal in  no maner ete no growel ne
raw fruit, ne no mete þat makiþ inflacioun  And he schal drinke no newe
wijn, & he schal ete no greet saule,  and
whanne he haþ ete þan he schal reste him-silf. & he schal not arise, but
if his ligature be faste bounden, & he schal not lepe, & he schal not
crie ne renne, & he lepe vpon an hors softli. & whanne he sittiþ at


      

priuy he schal not streyne him-silf to harde, & he schal ete no mete þat
wole make him costif. & if he wole ony þing traueile, he schal do it þe
while he is fastynge. & if he wole holde alle þes preceptis he mai be
hool  & þis medicyne is certeyn, for he schal herfore lyue neuere þe
lasse while.

 If hernia be watri, þis is þe signe þerof, þat his ballok wole be heuy
& schynynge, & if þou pressist it wiþ þi fyngir þou schalt fele watrynes
þeron  ffirst þou must loke wher it be litil or myche  — —
& þan medicyns þat ben consumynge & driynge suffisiþ  Þerfore þat þou
schalt fynde here aftir in þe chapitre of þe droþesie.  If the  mater be greet, þan avoide awei þe mater wiþ kuttynge & wiþ
cauterijs. But if þou make cauterijs, þe watir wole come aȝen þerto, &
þe cauterijs wolen lette þat þer schal no more mater come þerto.  If þe
mater be of wynd: þat þou myȝt knowe bi inflacioun þat is not ledi
colour  & bi
felynge wiþ þi fyngris, if þou felist no watrines þeron, ne heuynes; þe
cure herof is with electuari maad of greynes of lauri & oþere þingis þat
schulen be said in þe chapitre of þe dropesi in tympanido.   If it be superfluite of fleisch, þat
þou miȝte wite wiþ þi fyngris, it wole be hard,  þe cure herof mai not be do, but if þou kutte þe skyn
þat is wiþoute & drawe out þe mater, & þan soude it, & if it be in þe
oon part hard & callous, & in þat oþer part neische, þan it is better
þat þou sette noon hand þeron, & principali if it be blac & ledi. 
Varicosa schal be curid wiþ gotis whey, & with epithimo, & wiþ
purgaciouns of malancolious blood, & þan leie þerto þingis þat ben

 Of a stoon in þe bladdre & reynis  

Astoon in a man is engendrid of plente of  grete humouris
wiþinne a man, as we moun se an ensample wiþoutforþ of oþere þingis, in
þe maner þat men brennen tilis in a furneis. Þei maken first þe tilis of
strong cley þat is viscous, & whanne þei han schape it as þei wolen, þan
þei leie it in þe sunne to drie  & þan þei doon hem in a furneis wiþ
fier. & þe stronger fier þat þe


      

tilis han, þe stronger þei wolen be, & riȝt so in a mannes bodi, whanne
a man haþ miche viscous matere in his bodi & mai not be putt out for
febilnes of expulcioun, & þan scharp hete specialy in þe reines falliþ
to þat mater & makith it hard, & in þis maner engendriþ þe stoon in þe
reynes.  Also in children a stoon engendriþ in her bladdre; for þe
reynes of a child ben not so hote as a mannes  In þis maner þou schalt
knowe wher þe stoon be in a mannes bladdre or in his reynes   If þe grauel of his vrine be whit:
þan þe stoon is in þe bladdre  And if þe grauel be reed, þan it is in
his reynes   
Summen þat ben hardi wolen asaie for to cure a man wiþ kuttynge þat haþ
þe stoon in his reynes; for þei knowiþ  not þe perel of
woundis þat falliþ in þe reynes þat I haue aforseid, & þan þei doiþ no
more saue bringe þe pacient to his deeþ.  Now I wole teche in what
maner a man schal kepe him þat is disposid to haue þe stoon, he schal
ete no metis þat ben viscous ne to scharpe, & tofore alle þingis hard
chese gaderiþ viscous mater & hard. & he schal ete no beef, ne no
fleisch of a goos, ne no grete briddis þat swymmeþ in þe water, & he
schal ete no fleisch of an hert, & he schal ete no swete breed,  & al maner mete þat is maad of swete past, & he schal ete
no whete soden, & he schal ete no maner þing þat is maad of milk saue þe
whey, & he schal drinke no coold watir, & he schal ete no fruitis þat

myche salt, & he schal absteyne him fro alle þingis þat engendriþ
scharpe humouris & grete, & he schal not ete to greet sauly   In þis maner he schal diete him-silf, he schal ete breed
þat is wel leueyned  &


      

his breed wole be þe bettir for him if it be medlid wiþ
poudre maad of fenel-seed & persil, & he schal drinke sutil wijn &
cleer, medlid wiþ fair cleer water  And if his reynes & his bowels
weren hote, þan he mai drinke coold water þat be fair & clene, & he mai
ete fleisch of capouns & hennes & chikenes, & partrichis, & of alle
oþere maner of briddis þat mouen in feeldis, & of hem þat woneþ in watir
he schal not ete. & he mai ete pork & motoun & principali of beestis þat

 & he mai ete eiren þat ben neische soden;
fisch þat haþ no schellis & þe substaunce of him be greet & hard, he
schal not ete þerof  Alle maner fisch þat haþ manie schellis, is better
þan he þat haþ no schellis  And of erbis: he schal ete fenel, ache,
persil, sperge, attriplicem,  spinochia &
boraginem, erucam, melones, cucumeris, & he schal be war þat he ete no
substaunce of caul, & he schal ete no mustard  And he mai ete þese
maner fruits: almaundis, auellanes, figis, notis, vuas bene maturas. &
he schal not  traueile to miche  aftir
mete, & he schal bere noon heuy birþuns, ne he schal not be girt to
streite, & he schal not slepe vpon his reynes. & if his reynes ben to
hote, þan he schal anoynte hem wiþ oile of rosis, medlid wiþ vinegre, &
he schal anointe his reynes wiþ a lynnen clooþ wet in iuys of colde

to make him haue appetit þerto  for greet medlynge wiþ wymmen wiþ greet
traueile achaufit a mannes reynes & consumeþ her natural moistnes  Who
so euere vsiþ þis regimen, he schal haue no drede of engendringe of þe
stoon  Who so vsiþ þis regimen  & is disposid for to haue þe stoon, with medicyns he schal do
it awei or it be confermed. He schal vse sirupis duretikis  : as oximel
diureticum & squilliticum,  or he schal vse a sirup þat auicen made  ℞,

consumed awei, & þan cole hem & do þerto lī. x of sugre, & þan clarifie
it & seþe it  & kepe it for þin vss  The vss of þis sirip
wole suffise for to do it awei; but if þe mater be þe more greet, & þan
þou miȝt do þerto if þou wolt oximel squilliticum, or þou miȝt ordeine
þe sirip wiþ modicis  erbis diureticis.  Þer is no þing
so good for to purge mater of þe reines as is castynge  for whi
castinge curiþ vlcera of þe reynes  In þe somer þou schalt make him
oonys in þe moneþe sich a maner of vomet  Take þe seed of raphani &
make it clene & kutte it ouerþwert in rollis, & lete þis lie in þe
forseid sirup . iiij. adai & anyȝt  & þan lete þe pacient ete

in þe forseid sirup, & whanne he hath ete his saule & drunke, þan binde
vpon his iȝen neische lynet or flex, & streyne þou not it to harde but
meneli. & þan take watir in which has been soden anetum til it bicome

þerinne, & make him  drinke vp al togidere, & þan he schal
caste vp al his mete & al his drink, & manye wickede humours þerwiþ. &
þan make him gadere out þe foul mater of his nose, & waische his mouþ &
his teeþ; þis medicyn wole do awei þe mater of þe stoon & purge wel his
reynes, þis is þe best medicyn þat mai be, for to kepe a man fro þe stoon.

 If þe man be not hool in þis maner, saue þe stoon is confermed fast,
þan þe cure þerof mai be in .ij. maners: þat oon is for to aswage þe
akynge, & þat oþer is for to breke þe stoon & putte him out  Whanne a

sitte þeron anoon to þe nauele, & in his baþ schulen be soden leeues of

If þe stoon be in his bladdre, þan þou schalt worche in þis maner 
First þou schalt take kepe wher he haue stranguria. Þat þou miȝt wite if
he makiþ watir droppynli & a litil at oonys, & haþ greet penaunce in his

him a clisterie mollificatif þat þou mowe avoide his bowels, & þan þou
schalt frote his noseþrillis with watir,  & þou schalt presse liȝtly þe

þan putte þi fyngir in  his ers, & þere þou schalt fele þe

remeued, þan þe pacient mai make watir, þan his akinge wole ceesse, &
þan þou schalt go to þe cure. First þou schalt make him a clisterie of
duritikis  in which schulen be medicyns þat haue propriete for to breke
þe stoon, & þan sette þe pacient in a baþ þat is forseid. & a litil
tofore or he go out of his baþ, ȝeue him of þe poudre of þe hare þat is
forseid. & whanne he comeþ out of þe baþ, leie þis enplastre vpon þe

þou schalt sette him in þe forseid baþ, & leie vpon þe forseid plastre,
& ȝeue him of þe forseid poudre. Þis cure is good & I haue preued it 

If alle þese medicyns availiþ not, þan þou muste drawe out þe stoon wiþ
kuttynge or þe patient falle into etikis.  & if þou wolt drawe  out a stoon of þe bladdre wiþ
kuttynge, þan þou muste apparaile  alle þingis þat ben necessarie
for þee: as sirupis & ligaturis, & þan þou schalt binde his hipis & his
leggis faste, þat he mowe not meue, for to lette þee whanne þou wolt
kutte him. & þanne þou schalt anoynte þi longist fyngir of þi lift hond
& þi þombe wiþ oile, & þou schalt putte hem in þe pacientis ers, saue
first þou schalt avoide him wiþ a clisterie mollificatif, & þou schalt

take kepe of manye þingis  First þou muste take kepe of þe age of þe
pacient, for children þat ben xiiij. wintir oold ben moost able for þis
cure,  aftir fourti ȝere he þat haþ
þe ston is nouȝt i-saued."] for her lymes ben tendir ynowȝ, & in þat
elde þei ben strong ynowȝ for to be maad hool, & her complexioun is hoot
& moist. Ȝonge children & olde men ben not able to be kutt, for in þe
kuttynge of hem enpostyms wolen engendre hastili, & þat wole lette þe
vrine & make more akynge, & so þei miȝten falle in-to þe spasme, & so
wiþ þe spasme þei miȝt be deed  Summen seien þat olde men ben able to
be kutt, for her blood is miche laskid  & her hete, & þerfore þei
ben not able to take an enpostym; þerfore þei ben moost able to be kutt
of þe stoon  Summen seien þat her lymes ben to drie & her vertues ben
to feble   & þerfore þei ben not able to be kutt, & herwiþ
I acorde  Þese .ij. þingis: engendrynge of an enpostym, & if þe place
þat is kutt wole not soude, þese .ij. bringiþ perel of deeþ  Also þou
muste take kepe of þe schap of þe stoon, & what quantite þat he be, for
if þe stoon be .ij. forkid  or cornerid, or so
greet þat he may not be brouȝt into þe necke of þe bladdre, þan þou
schalt in no maner kutte him, but if þou miȝt first wiþ þin hond breke
þe stoon. & þan if þou miȝt not bringe it out at oonys, þan in diuers
tymes þou schalt gadere him out.  
And if þe stoon be so greet þat he mai not be brouȝt into þe necke of þe
bladdre, þan þou schalt in no maner kutte him, forwhi he mai not be
brouȝt out, but if þou woldist kutte þe substaunce of þe bladdre & þat
were mortal; but þou schalt put him to þe botme of þe bladdre wiþ
instrumentis, & teche þe patient for to kepe him in þat maner þat þe
stoon falle not into þe necke of þe bladdre  Also if he be so sutil þat
he mai not be felid wiþ þin hond, þan þou schalt not kutte him neiþer. &
if þe patient mai be hool in ony  maner, or kutt wiþouten
passioun, it


      

is better þat  he be nouȝt kutt þan he be kutt.  for men þat ben so kutt
schulen neuere gete children, but if it be þe more hap  ;
& also it is perilous for to kutte  & þerfore I rede þee take þat
wynnynge  to oþere
cirurgians.  Ful ofte tyme men leie me to scorn, for I wolde not
entermete me of sich curis, & seide þat I lefte siche maner curis, for I
coude not do it, & þe same þei seide of men þat weren filme broke,  & of men þat

þei han do þat cure ful ofte, & so he mai be brouȝt into an yuel looss

& hise lymes bicomith coold, & atach of þe feuere, 
& greet akinge in þe place þat was kutt, alle þese signes ben signes of

þou schalt binde his ȝerde bihinde þe stoon, þat þe stoon mowe not go

Thouȝ þis book be maad oonli of cirurgie, ȝitt it is myn entencioun to
speke of þe dropesie, & principaly þat ben wrouȝt


      

wiþ mannes hond.  I seie þat þe dropesie is a sijknes compound in which
superflue mater þat is coold swelliþ þe body  Men of salerne seiden þat
þere weren .iiij. maner spicis of dropesie, & iiij. maner dropesies. But
auctours of arabie acorden alle at  oonys,  & seien sooþ þat þer ben
but .iij. maner dropesies,  & þat oon comeþ of
rawe blood, of raw fleume medlid wiþ blood, & is bore into al þe bodi, &
swelliþ al þe bodi, & is clepid yposarca. Þat oþer is of mater of ȝelowȝ
water & falliþ into þe holownes of þe wombe, & is clepid aschites 
Þe .iij. is engendrid of greet wynd resolued of coold mater, & falliþ
into þe holownes of þe wombe, & is clepid tympanites  Of þis ydropesie
summen iugiþ liȝtli, & seien þat yposarca comeþ of coold alwei, &
tympanites comeþ sumtyme of wynd & of hete, but moost comounli of
cooldnes  Aschites comith moost of hete, & ful selden of cooldnes  but
for to seie þe soþe, alle þe spicis ben medlid with coold mater, &
þerfore he seiþ sooþ þat clepiþ eueri ydropesie coold mater,  for euery
spice of þe dropesie mai come of hete or of cooldnes goynge tofore. 
Þer is no þing þat defendiþ, þat whanne þe lyuere is hoot out of hir
propir hete, or if al þe bodi is distempid in hete, as in feueris,
þe patient mai so miche be feblid þerwiþ, þat it may engendre coold
mater & fleumatik  Ful ofte I haue had þis caas   Þerfore
auctouris seien þat þe dropesie comith of þe febilnes of þe lyuere 
þerfore men of salerne seien þat it comeþ of defaute of digestioun of þe
lyuere. & it comeþ of takinge of yuele metis & drinkis, & of febilnes of
oþere lymes, as of þe stomak, & of þe reynes, & of þe maris, & of þe
lungis, & of diafragma. & whanne þese lymes ben enfeblid, þan þe lyuere
enfebliþ  Therfore it is necessarie for a leche to wite  wher it comeþ of causis goinge tofore hoot or coold  And
summe lechis halden hem paid for to haue a siȝt of þe vrine, & iugiþ þe
dropesie hoot & coold bi þe siȝt of þe vryne  for if þe vrine be reed,
þei wolen iuge þat þe cause is hoot, & in þis maner þei ben


      

disseyued   Forwhi, in what maner so þe lyuere be enfeblid of coold
cause or of hoot, it wole make his vrine reed  For sumtyme a man mai
not ȝeue a discrecioun  of blood fro
vrine, for a litil blood colourid miche vrine, riȝt as a litil saffron
colouriþ miche water  Þerfor of what cause so it be þat his lyuere be
enfeblid, his vrine mai schewe reed.  Also þe signes of yposarcha &
aschites & tympanite ben open ynowȝ.  In þis maner þou
schalt knowe hem  In yposarcha al þe bodi swelliþ, as his face, & his
armis, & his riggeboon, & his necke, & alle his lymes, so þat in what
partie of his bodi þat þou pressist þi fyngir þere wole be a pitt. &
whanne þe fyngir is aweie it wole arise aȝen  & it is a greet maistrie
for to knowe wheþer yposarcha come of coold cause tofore goynge or of
hoot cause  If it comeþ of coold goinge tofore, þan his iȝen wolen be
discolourid as it were þe colour of askis, or pale   If it come of
hete goinge tofore, þan his iȝen wolen be ȝelowȝ or sumwhat reed  & þou
muste wite, wheþer he had a feuere tofore or haue þe feuere fortis
þerwiþ  or if he hadde þere tofore an hoot enpostym þerwiþ, ouþer he

face, & his necke, & his brest, & his armis bicomith smal, & his vois
schal bicome smal, & his wombe schal oonli swelle. & sumtyme in þe
firste bigynnyng his feet & his leggis wolen swelle in þe firste
bigynnynge, for þe greet strenkþe of þe mater þat makiþ it falle adoun.
& if þou  smite his  wombe, he wole sowne
as it were a touȝt leþer ful of wynd   Þese ben þe propre signes of tympanites: his wombe
& þe regioun of his stomac schulen oonly be to-swolle, & alle his oþere
lymes, boþe his feet, & his leggis, & his necke, & his armis wolen
bicome smal, & if þou smitist him vpon his wombe, it wole soune as it
were a tympan  & in þis passioun þer is lasse agreuaunce þan in aschite
& more swellynge. & if þou pressist his wombe, þou schalt fynde it
streite as it were a corde. & þou schal fele no meuyng of water, whanne
þe pacient turneþ him from o side to anoþer  Curis herof þou schalt

 Þis þing is necessarie for to ȝeue a man þat haþ þe hote dropesie, a

Þe cure þat is wiþ iren falliþ oonli in aschite, þat manie men doon

 Of ficus, & cancre, & vlcer in mannes  ȝerde 

Ficus is a maner wexynge þat arisiþ vpon a mannes ȝerde tofore. &

Þis is þe cure of ficus þat comith of fleume: þou schalt binde him wiþ a

& in þis place þou schalt not forȝete to leie a defensif vpon þe place
þat is hool, for þis defensif schal defende þe place þat is hool fro

Of Emeroidis & fistule in þe ers 

Emoroides ben veines þat endiþ in a mannes ers & ben .v. 
Þese veines sumtyme openeþ & sumtyme þei ben enpostymed. Whanne þe blood

It falliþ ofte tyme þat after þe flux of þe emeroidis, ouþer if enpostym

Of þe cancre  and þe mormole 

Cancrene ben rounde vlceris þat falliþ in a mannes leggis, & malum
mortuum also, & þei falliþ boþe in oon place, þerfore I wole make
difference þerof   Cancrene ben round vlcera & ben foule & comeþ of
dedinge of þe skyn,  for þe natural spiritis comen not þerto, & þerfore þe
place is corrupt  & if þe corrupcioun go anoon to þe boon, þan it schal
not be clepid cancrenum, but it schal be clepid aschachiles.
 & if þe corrupcioun ocupie al þe lyme, þan it schal be
clepid herpes estiomenus, þat is as miche to seie as etyng him-silf. 
Þe signes of cancrenarum ben blac vlcera, & þe fleisch þerof wole be
foule & of ledi colour, & þe lippis þerof wolen be gret, & þe fleisch
þat is in þe middil  of vlcera wole be corrupt. & it be
miche lijk to a cancre þat is vlceratus, but þis is þe difference þerof
þat a cancre comeþ of corrupcioun of


      

malancolie, & þis comeþ of lesynge of þe spiritis of lijf  Also þe
lippis of þe cancre ben more reuersid and more grene, & a cancre fretiþ
more  And þerfore þis passioun is clepid of summen a deed cancre 

Þe cure of þis passioun is in þis maner  first þou schalt avoide his
bodi of malancolie, & þouȝ it be not his principal cause as it is of a
cancre  ȝitt þe mater þat falliþ to þe place is greet  Þerfore it is
good for to clense his blood of malancolie; for it is good þing in
vlcera þat ben olde, & principali whanne þei ben in parties bineþeforþ 
& whanne he is clensid, þan lete him blood in þe veyne þat is bitwixe þe
leeste too of his foot & þe too next þerto, in þe same leg þat þe
passioun is on. & vpon þe place þou schalt caste pouder of affodillorum,
ouþer remeue awei al þe deed fleisch  If þou wolt worche more surely &
bettere, make him a cauterie, þat  it be myche & long as þe

of þe passioun as depe as þe deed fleisch is. & þan þou schalt leie
þeron a plastre maad of whete mele & iuys of ache, & þan cure it vp as
þou doist oþere vlcera, as it is forseid  And in þis caas þou schalt
not forȝete in no maner for to leie aboute þe place a defensif of bole &
terra sigillata; for þat wole suffre no wickide mater to renne to þe

maner scabbe, & comeþ of grete humouris brent, & falliþ to þe place. &
sum part þerof leueþ in a mannys flank, & engendriþ glandulas &

Take þe grete titimalle & þe smale, & boile hem in vinegre & in oile, &

Of varices, þat ben veynes, and elephancia. 

Uarices ben clepid veynes, þat ben grete, & grene, & purpur, & sittiþ

cure of varicium is in þis maner: þou schalt purge him wiþ gotis whey &
wiþ epithimo, for þis purgacioun is propre in þis caas, or purge him wiþ
pelottis of epithimi. & lete him blood in þe veyne þat is clepid

Also anoþer maner cure: lete him blood oonli in þe same veyne, & take

For I siȝ men þat her veynes weren so kutt þat weren algate sijk

Of blood-letyng 

Blood-letyng is a craft for to-laske a mannes blood þat is in his
veynes   And þis þou schalt wel wite, þat it falliþ for
oure craft, þouȝ we for pride take it to barbouris & to wommen; & blood-
letynge falliþ principali for cirurgians  O lord, whi is it so greet
difference bitwixe a cirurgian & a phisician, but for philosophoris
bitoken þe craft into lewid mennes hondis  or as manie men haue
dedignacioun for to worche wiþ her hondis  & ȝitt mani men weneþ þat it
is inpossible þat oon man to kunne boþe þe craftis   But þou schalt knowe wel þis, þat he is no
good phisician þat can no þing in cirurgie  And also þe contrarie
þerof: a man mai be no good cyrurgian, but if he knowe phisik.  Blood-
letynge is vsid bi cause for to kepe a mannes bodi hool, & to remeue
awei sijknessis fro a mannes bodi  But þus manye þingis þou muste take
kepe in blood-leting: tyme, & hour, & eir, & disposicioun of þe sike
man  & þou muste take kepe þat þou lete no man blood but if he mowe
endure itt   First a man schal be lete blood for to kepe him-silf,
 & principali hem þat etiþ good fleisch
 & drinkiþ good wijn, & etiþ metis for to engendre myche
blood, & traueiliþ but litil, & principali þe while a man is ȝong, &
also in eelde if he be myche vsid þerto  Also þou schalt lete hem blood
þat ben wont to haue akynge in her ioyntis, ouþer a feuere þat is clepid
sinocha  or þe squinacie, ouþer pleureses  Alle þese, tofore þe tyme
þat þei ben woned to haue her passioun, þou schalt lete hem blood or her
passioun come, þat it mowe go awey þerwiþ: & þis maner is clepid
preuisiuus.  Þe iij. maner: whanne a man haþ greet akynge in


      

his heed wiþouten  a feuere, or a squinantes plureses,
periplumonia, apostema calida, & eueri sijknes þat comeþ of to miche
blood. In alle þese causis þou schalt lete him blood; & þis maner is
clepid curantes.   Now I wole telle alle maners in
what maner a man schal be leten blood  ffirst, who schal lete þee
blood  Þe .ij, whanne it is necessarie for to be lete blood  Þe .iij.,
in whiche veynes a man schal be leten blood for diuers passiouns, & in
what maner þe veyne schal be kut.  A man þat schal be letere blood
schal be ȝong,  & he schal be no child, ne noon oold man, ne
he schal not quake, & he schal haue a good scharp siȝt; & loke þat he
kunne knowe veines, & þat he kunne knowe hem from arterijs; & he schal
haue manie diuers tool 
for to lete blood þerwiþ, & þei schulen be clene and cleer, & not rusti;
& summe of his tool schulen be longe, & summe schorte, for to peerse
aftir þat þe veyne is greet þerto  Also children schulen not be lete
blood, but if it were greet nede, & he were so replet of blood þat he
schulde be achekid þerwiþ; þat þou miȝt knowe bi þe streitnes of his
breeþ & fulnes of his veynes, & bi reednes of his face. Þan it is
necessarie þat he be leten blood; but it is ful greet drede for to lete
a child blood, þerfore I wyle ȝeue no counseil þerto. & if it so be þat
he be in perel of deeþ, þan lete him blood  Now þou art war of þis
perel, do as þou seest þat it is to do; & þou schalt warne þe childis
fadir & his modir of þe perels þat ben aforseid, & saue þee fro blame. 
Also olde men schulen not be lete blood, & ȝitt summe olde men ben
strenger of vertu þan summe ȝonge  men; & þan þou schalt
take hede to þe rule in þis maner: þat þou schalt not lete hem blood
whanne þei arisiþ out of her sijknes   Also wommen wiþ childe schulen
not be lete blood, & speciali not in þe .iij. firste moneþis, ne in þe
laste monþe  Also ȝonge men þat ben white & pale, & haueþ fewe heeris
in her browis, & haueþ smale veynes & priui, ne ben not couenable to be
lete blood; ne men þat han manie humours & litil blood, for blood þat is
in hem is tresour.  Ffrensch men doon hem-silf miche harme in þis caas;
whanne þei ben ful of coold humours & corrupt þei letiþ hem-silf blood,
& þan þei seen her blood corrupt &


      

foul, & þan þei supposen þat þei han wel doon þat þei haue lete out þat
blood, & þe barbour wole seie þat he mote hastili be lete blood aȝen 
It were wel better to him þat he hadde kept his blood, & þat þe corrupt
humours hadde be voidid awei in oþer maner   Blood-letynge is not good
for a man at þe firste bigynnynge of cataracta, ne noon ventuse is not
good for him  but in causis as it is forseid, blood-letyng is good 
And  if a man etiþ miche fleisch & drinkiþ miche wijn, for
þis wole engendre miche blood  And þan but if a man lete him blood, þan
þere wole engendre diuers sijknes þerof, & ofte tyme sodeyn deeþ  Also
men þat haue þe goute of blood, he schal be lete blood tofore þe tyme
þat he supposiþ to haue his passioun; for ofte tyme þis wole take awey
his akynge. & in alle sijknessis þat comeþ principali of blood, it is
good for hem to be lete blood  Also men þat haueþ synocham, blood-
letynge is ful necessarie to hem, til þei swowne. & þis wole do awei þe
feuere, or it waastiþ so miche þe mater; & þan he muste be holpen wiþ
oþere medicyns, þat þou schalt fynde in bokis of phisik   If he be not lete blood, þan þe blood þat is in him wole
boile vpward to þe brest, & gadere togidere in the brest, þat þe pacient
schal be ful nyȝ stoppid.  & sumtyme a
veine wole breke in þe piyse or in þe lungis, & þan þat veine mai not be
streyned ne stoppid, & þan þe patient schal die þeron.  In þis chapitre
it is myn entencioun forto speke oonly of openynge of veines  þat ben in us,  & what vertu þer is
þerinne. In boþe armis of a man þer ben .iij. veines þat ben in us for
to be lete blood þeron  Þe .i. is clepid cephalica, & is þe hiȝeste
veine of þe arme, & sitt next þe elbowe  ; &
þis veine mote be kut large, & not to depe  If þat veine be kut streit,
þan ofte tyme it makiþ an enpostym  & also þou muste be wel war þat þou
touche no synewis  For þe same cause þou miȝt lete a man blood vpon þe
hond, bitwixe his þombe & þe nexte fyngir þerto  Basilica sittiþ adoun
aforȝens þe elbowe, vndir þe arme, & þis veine sittiþ ful nyȝ þe gret
arterie: & þerfore a man mote be wel war þat he touche not þe arterie
veyne. & for þe perel of þe arterie it is good for to lete him blood
bitwixe þe litil fyngir & þe fynger next þerto. & þis blood-letynge is
good for


      

alle þe placis vndir þe brest, & for þe lyuere.  Of þis veine þat is
clepid Basilica, & of þe veine þat is cepid Cephalica, comeþ a veine
þat is clepid Mediana  And whanne a man is lete blood in þis veyne, it
is perel of ij. grete synewis þat liggiþ in boþe sidis  of
þe veyne. And whanne þou þinkist to avoide al a mannes bodi, þan þou
schalt lete him blood in þis veine, & principali for þe herte & for þe
brest.  In Basilica, in þe riȝt hond, þou schalt lete a man blood for
passioun of þe lyuere, & in þe lift hond for passioun of þe splene,
 & in þe liftside of þe forheed  it is good to lete blood for akynge of þe heed,  &
principali whanne sijknes is confermed in a mannes heed. & þis I
apreuede misilf  for sumtyme it doiþ awei þe frenesi. & I siȝ a womman
þat hadde akynge in hir heed, þat it miȝte not be take awei, & I lete
hir blood in hir hond as it is forseid & purgide hir, & þe veine in hir
forheed þat was gretter þan ony oþer veine in hir bodi; & I openede þat
veine, & anoon riȝt sche was hool  But whanne þou wolt lete a man blood
in þat place, þou schalt streyne þe necke & kutte þe veine endelongis; &
þis blood-letynge is good for tynea, þat is in a mannes heed, & for
Saphati.  & for demigrania þou schalt lete blood in þe templis
of his heed. & þe same blood-letynge is good for passion  of
a mannes iȝen  I hadde a ȝong man in my kepinge þat hadde demigrayn
 of hoot
cause, & I purgide him ofte & lete him blood, and I knytte þe arterie
þat was in þe same side of his heed, & þo he was cured for euermore 
Also letynge blood in þe veynes bihinde hise eeris is good for þe
dimigrayn & for tineam  Also letynge blood in þe tunge is good for þe
squinacie, & for enpostyms, þat ben as it were almaundis, & for brancis;
 but he


      

schal be lete blood tofore in þe heed-veyne. & it is good for þe iȝen, &
it is good for icchinge & for pustulis in þe nose, & for scotomia þat
comeþ of blood  Sumtyme a man is lete blood in veynes in þe necke, þat
ben clepid gwide,  for drede of suffocacioun
 of
blood; & sumtyme in leprous men, þat schulen be lete blood in her lippis
bineþe.  & þis is good for hote enpostyms
in þe mouþ, & for hote passiouns of þe gommys.  In a mannes foot
ben .iij., þat ben profitable to be lete blood for manie passiouns  And
þer is oon veyne in a mannes hamme vndir his knee, þat is good to be
lete  blood for passiouns of þe maris, & for to bringe out
menstrue: & it avoidiþ al þe bodi.  Also þer is anoþer veine, þat
sittiþ bitwixe þe holowe of þe foot wiþinneforþ, & is clepid Sophena; &
in þis veyne wommen ben leten blood for passiouns of þe maris, & men ben
lete blood in þe veine of þe same place for enpostyms of þe ballokis. 
Þe veine þat serueþ for þe scie, is wiþoute bitwixe þe heele & þe holowe
of þe foot wiþoutforþ, & blood-letynge in þis veine is good for
sciacam passionem, as it is aforseid in þe cure of sciatica.  Herof
þou schalt take kepe. If þou þinkist for to lete a man blood in .ij.
diuers times, & not al at oonys, þan þou schalt do in þis maner; & in
þis caas, whanne þou wolt lete a man miche blood, and ne darist not do
it al at oonys; þan whanne þou letist him blood, þou schalt make þe
inscicioun of þe veine þe more long, þat it soude not hastili; & þan þou
schalt binde his arme, & smite þe place þere þou wolt lete him blood wiþ
þi fyngir, & make him blede more, as myche as þou seest þat good is 
  Also whanne þou wolt wiþ blood-letyng make þe mater go to
þe place aforȝens; whanne þou hast lete out þe .iij. part off blood þat
he schal blede, þan þou schalt sette þi fingir vpon þe wounde, & make
him stonde vp & remeue  him-silf, & lete him sitte adoun, & do awei
þi fyngir & lete him blede more. & þus þou schalt do .iij.


      

siþis or .iiij., for in þis maner þe blood drawiþ more to þe partie
aforȝens, & þe vertu of þe pacient schal þe better be kept.  Also if a
man is wont to swowne in blood-letynge ouþer falle doun, þan lete him
lie & be lete blood  Also or he be lete blood, lete him ete a schiuer
of breed toostid & leid in wijn of granatorum.  Alle maner veynes in
blood-letinge schulen be kutt endelongis  And whanne þou wolt lete a
man blood in þe partijs aboue þe necke, þan þou muste binde þe veine,
 til þe veyne arise þat þou
wolt lete him blood on  And whanne þou wolt lete a man blood in his
arme, þan þou muste binde his arme þe brede of foure fyngris aboue þe
place; & þou muste  be wel war þat þou streyne not to faste,
as manie men doon  Manie men binden so faste a mannes arm, þat he main
not fele his arm  Veynes of a mannes feet & in his hondis, if þou wolt
lete a man blood þeron, þan þou muste sette hem in hoot water, & lete
hem achaufe þeron an hour; & þan þou muste binde his foot ouþir his hond
aboue þe ioinct wiþ a boond, & algate his foot or his hond mote be in þe
watir as longe as he schal blede 

Of kuttyngis and bledyngis 

Siccia is sett sumtyme for kuttynge & sumtime wiþoute kuttynge, and
sumtyme wiþ kuttinge.  Wiþout kutting as vpon a mannes wombe or wommans 
ffor akynge þat comeþ of wijnd, & it is good for to waste wijnd  Also
it is sett vpon þe wei of þe stoon þat falliþ adoun of þe reynes, & þan
it schal be sett a litil bineþe þe akynge þat it mowe drawe þe stoon
lower & lower til it come to þe hole of þe bladdre  Also it is sett
vndir a wommans tetis for to restreyne þe blood of þe nose & of þe
maris  Also it is sett vpon þe region  of þe wombe for
fallinge of þe maris, þat is clepid dislocacioun of þe maris: as if the
maris falle adoun in þe riȝtside, þan it schal be sett in þe liftside 
And if þe maris falle in þe liftside, þan it schal be sett in þe
riȝtside  Also it is sett vndir a mannes eere for to drawe out a greyne
or a stoon of þe eere þat is falle yn  Also it is sett vndir a mannes
ers to drawe out þe emeroidis þat sittiþ hid fer yn  And it schal be
sett in eueri place þere þou wolt make a greet attraccioun  Also it is
good for to be sett vpon þe bitynge of a wood hound, & vpon þe biting of
a venymous beest.


      

It schal be sett þeron wiþ scarificacioun, also in causis þere þou
lettist for to drawe blood for febilnes, or for elde, or in children; &
hem after .iiij. ȝeer oold we moun garcie, whanne blood leting is
forboden hem, & speciali whanne we purposen for to drawe awei mater þat
is vndir þe skyn  Also we moun garse a man bihinde in þe nol of þe heed
— —  & for
greuaunce of þe iȝen, & vpon þe .ij. corneris of þe heed for tinea & for
pustules þat ben in þe heed vnder  a mannes chyn, for wennys
of þe face & for vlcera þat ben in þe mouþ & in þe lippis & for akynge
of þe teeþ  Also if it be sett bytwixe þe .ij. schuldris for swownynge
& for quakinge of þe herte, & for hem þat han to miche blood in þat
place. Þis maner letynge blood avoidid a mannes bodi miche & makiþ him
feble  

Also watir lechis  drawiþ more blood þan
þese  In þis maner þou schalt knowe whiche ben gode watir lechis &
whiche ben nouȝt. Þei þat han blac colour medlid wiþ diuers colouris, &
þei þat haueþ grete hedis & ben in foule stynkynge watris & han miche
spume on hem ben nouȝt  And in þis maner þou schalt knowe whiche ben
gode: þei þat han reed wombis & litil reed rewis in þe rigge medlid wiþ
grene, & whanne þei haueþ litil hedis & smale tailis, & whanne þei ben
in good watir þat ben manie froggis yn. & or þou sette hem vpon a man,
þei schulen be kept al adai fastynge. & þan þou schalt ȝeue him a litil
scharp blood for to ete, & þan þou schalt waische hem wiþ cleer water; &
þan vpon þe  place þat he schal be


      

sett, þe place schal be wel frotid tofore, þat it bicome reed, & þan
sette þervpon a ventuse for to drawe þerto blood. & þan anoynte þe same
place wiþ blood, & þan sette þervpon þe watir leche. & whanne he is ful
& þou wolt do him awei, blowe vpon þe place baurac, ouþer askis maad of
paper. & whanne he is falle awei, þan sette þervpon a ventuse aȝen to
drawe more blood to þe plase. & þan sette þervpon anoþer watir leche, if
þere gaderiþ þerto miche mater. & þis maner is good for al maner blood
þat is rotid, for it draweth it out 

Of cauterium or brennyng of large & streite. 

Cauterium is seid in ij. maners, þat is to seie large & streit. &
cauterium is seid propurli a brennynge wiþ gold or wiþ sum oþer
instrument þat is hoot, ouþer wiþ watir or wiþ oile, ouþer wiþ medicyn
caustica, ouþer wiþ herbis  And þer ben manie medicyns for to make
cauterijs, whiche þou schalt fynde pleynlier in þe antidotarie  A
cauterie is clepid streit,  whanne it is maad
wiþ an hoot yren, wiþ gold, or wiþ siluir  Cauterijs þat 
ben maad wiþ medicyns þat han vertu for to brenne  Þer is seid a
cauterie pole whanne it is not hoot in felinge  & þat cauterie
preuailiþ wiþouten brennynge as herbis  Þer is anoþer maner cauterie:
actual, for so miche as it brenneþ in dede  Of þis cauterie auicen
 spekiþ & seiþ, þat it is a medicyn, miche helpinge for to
defende, þat mater schal not departe into al þe lyme; & it wole comforte
þe lyme, & bringe it into good complexioun aȝen, & it wole dissolue
mater þat is corrupt, & it wole streyne flux of blood. & auicen seiþ,
þat a cauterie is oon of þe beste pointis of cirurgie  for þingis þat
mowe not be fulfillid in long tyme, wiþ cauterie þei ben fulfillid  As
it is seid phisicians leueþ þis craft to cirurgians. & þerfore it is
greet wondir if þer be ony good cirurgian founde, for þei ben alle lewid
men. & if a lewid man schal worche with cauterijs, þan he knowiþ not þe
difference bitwixe a cauterie þat is clepid actuel & potencial. & also
þei knowe not in what place of a mannes bodi þei schulen make hem. & þis
is so repreued þat it is almoost out  of vss  Also summen
maken cauterijs in vnclene bodies þat ben ful replet of


      

yuele humours, & þan cauterijs wolen do litil profit to passiouns þat
ben forseid, but þer wole falle þerto so manie humouris, & make þe place
of þe cauterie to swelle, & liȝtly engendre a cancre. & þan men þat ben
vnkunnynge ben agast herof & ben not hardi for to make no mo cauterijs.
& if þe patient hadde be purgid of grete humours tofore, þan it wolde
not haue fare so.  And summen vsen cantarides for to make cauterijs
þerwiþ, & leggen it vpon men þat han hote complexioun & drie; & þis is
contrarious & falliþ greet agreuaunce þerof, & þan þei seien þat
cauterijs ne ben nouȝt worþ  But auicen seiþ, þat a cauterie is good
tofore alle medicyns for to waaste & consume mater  if þe cauterie be
sett in place þere it schulde be, but if the mater be so miche þat þe
cauterie mai not consume it, as þou miȝt se an ensample herof: þat fier
ouercomeþ alle þingis  but if þou doist a litil fier among miche wet
wode, þer wole come smoke þerof. & the fier  mai not
ouercome to waaste þe wode, for water þat is in þe wode is more þan þe
fier  In þe same maner it fariþ of a cauterie þat is in a mannes bodi,
if he be ful of humouris, þanne þe cauterie mai not worche. & þerfor þou
schalt purge him wiþ laxatiuis tofore þe cauterie as it is aforseid 
Also þou schalt make no cauterijs in a man þat is ful of gode humours as
of blood, for þan oonli blood-letyng suffisiþ  but if þe patient be
strong & þe mater on him be coold & moist, þan a cauterie is good for to
driue awei þe mater. & a man schal not bere a cauterie, but .ij. moneþis
ouþer .iij. at þe mooste.  Now I wole telle þee a good rule  If þou
fyndist in a mannes body a lyme in wei of corrupcioun  : as herisipula, or herpes estiomenus,
ouþer formica, or in yuel disposicioun of a wounde þat bigynneþ to
encancre,  &
for al oþer corrupcioun, þan sette a cauterie in þe nexte welle to þe
place, for þe cauterie wole defende þe place fro corrupcioun.  Now
speke we of particlis of cauterijs þat falliþ in diuers placis of a
mannes bodi, & wiþ diuers instrumentis þei schulen  be maad,
whiche þou schalt se portraied  tofore þe, &
her signis forþwiþ.  Þe .i. instrument þat is comoun & moost in vss, is
clepid nodulum,  & is an instrument maad in
þis maner  Take a brood plate of iren & make þeron an hole, & leie þat
plate þere þou wolt make þi cauterie. & þan þou muste haue an iren maad
long & smal & maad hoot, & putte it in þat hole of þe plate  þis plate
wole saue þe place þat þe


      

cauterie schal be nomore but as þou wolt  & þat iren þat þou schalt
make þi cauterie þerwiþ, schal haue a litil round knap tofore. & þat
iren schal be maad hoot til it bicome reed  & þerwiþ þou schalt make þi
cauterie, & whanne þou doist awei þin iren, þere wole be vlcus. & þan
þou schalt leie þeron butter or oold grese, or grese stampid wiþ caul-
leues, & þat is þe best of alle, & leie it þerto, til þe cruste falle
awei þat þe hoot iren made. & þan þou schalt do þerto a litil pelot maad
of lynnen clooþ round & hard. & þat pelot schal be anoyntid wiþ oile, &
vpon þe place leie a caulleef, or an yue-leef, or a vine-leef, & in þis
 maner þou schalt holde it open as longe as þou wolt. 
The .ij. cauterie is clepid round, & haþ no knap at þe ende, but it is
schape long, & whanne þou makist þi cauterie, þou muste be war þat þou
touche no nerues ne veynes. & þis instrument schal be maad in þis maner,
þat it make a cauterie in boþe endis, after þat þou desirist, greet or
smal.  The .iij cauterie is clepid punctuale, & is ful necessarie
whanne þou wolt make a streit cauterie. & is maad in þis maner. 
The .iiij. is clepid radiale, & is smal & scharp, & is good for
children, & is maad in þis maner    The .v. cauterie is maad
in þis maner, & is swiþe comoun & is clepid calcellare.  & þis wole make a
long brennyng as ouerþwert þe heed, & whanne þou wolt make vlcera long
þat ben rounde, þan þou schalt worche wiþ þis cauterie.  The .vj. is
clepid subtile, & is good for festris þat sittiþ in þe corner of a
mannes iȝe, & it is good for yuel fleisch þat growiþ in a mannes iȝe, &
is maad in þis maner  þis sotille  cauterie schal be maad
hoot & putt in a canel in þis maner  The .vj.  is clepid dactilare, for it is
schape as it were þe stoon of a date. & herwiþ þou schalt make cauterijs
in þe haunche. & þere schal be an instrument schape as a table, & schal
be leid to þe haunche in þis maner, & haþ .vj. arisyngis þeron as haþ a
stoon of a date.  & oon þerof is in þe myddil, & .ij. aboue, & .j. bineþe, & oon
in boþe sidis in þis maner  Whanne þis instrument is hoot, it schal be
putt vpon a mannes haunche, & a table bitwixe maad of iren. & þis table
schal be coold, & þer schulen be .vj. holis


      

þeron, schape after þe cauterie þat haþ .vj. arisingis out as it is
aforseid. And þou schalt make .v. cauterijs vpon a mannes haunche,
& .ij. þerof schulen be aboue þe ioynct, & .ij. bi þe sidis, & oon vpon
þe ioynct, & .j. tofore þe ioynct.  Þe vij. is clepid triangulare, &
þerwiþ þer mai be maad .iij. at oonys. & þis cauterie is good for þe
haunche also, & is maad in þis maner   The .viij. cauterie is clepid
actuale,  for sumtyme it is maad wiþ a
nedle, & it is good  for to make cauterijs þerwiþ in þe
browis, & is maad sutil as a nedele.  The .ix. cauterie is clepid
linguale, & it is schape as it were a tunge of a litil brid in þis
maner. & it is good for to make cauterijs vpon a mannes browis  
The .x. cauterie is clepid ceton,  & is maad triangulis holowid.  & in þe hole þerof þere may entre a scharp
instrument þat haþ a fenestre  as it were a nedele, & it schal be
holde with coold tenaclis, also þe place þat þou wolt make þi cauterie
on. Þou schalt take vp þe skyn wiþ tenaclis, & putt in þin hoot iren
þoruȝ þe hole of þe tenaclis, & brenne þe skyn. Þan þou schalt make a
corde of wollen ȝerne & wete it in blood, & drawe it þoruȝ þe holis, &
þan þou schalt knytte þe .ij. endis togidere, & in þis maner þou schalt
holde it open as longe as þou wolt. Þis is a comoun cauterie, & þis
cauterie mai be maad in þe mouþ of þe stomac, & vpon þe lyuere & þe
splene, & vpon þe ballocke-leþeris  Now þou knowist alle þin
instrumentis, for to make cauterijs with, & her names  Now telle we in
what maner & in what place þou schalt make hem  In oold heed-akynge,
 whanne purgaciouns & laxatiuis & gargarismis & snesyngis
 & clisterijs & oþere maner of
avoidynge, & wiþ enplastris & wiþ anoyntyng, whanne þe akynge of a
mannes heed wole not go awei wiþ alle þese, ne þe epilencie,  ne noon passioun þat comeþ of þe heed, ne
passiouns of þe iȝen, & passiouns of þe eeren, & of þe noseþrillis, &
oold couȝe, & flux of þe wombe þat comeþ of þe reume.  For alle þese
passiouns þou schalt make cauterie þat is clepid cultellare in þe welle
of þe heed  ouer the founte throughoute the brayn.]


      

bihinde. & first schaue awei þe heeris, þere þou wolt make þi cauterie
as it is aforseid with an hoot iren, & herof þou schalt be ware þat þou
lete not þat iren be þere to longe, but þou schalt hastili make it, &
hastily do awei þe iren, & þan þou schalt do awei þe cruste þerof wiþ
butter, or wiþ oold grese, or wiþ leeues of caul, as it is aforseid. 
Þis cauterie schal be holde open wiþ litil pelottis as it is forseid as
longe as þou wolt, til þe patient be hool  But or þou make þi cauterie,
þou muste be wel ware, as it is aforseid, þat þin iren lie not to longe,
 but hastili take it awei, for if it were þere longe his
brayn myȝte be harmed þerbi.  Wiþ þis cauterie I helide a womman þat
hadde passiouns in hir heed manie diuers, & I miȝte not make hir hool
with no purgaciouns, ne wiþ noon anoyntingis, & wiþ þis cauterie I made
hir al hool.  Also þou muste make a round cauterie & touche oonly þe
skyn þerwiþ, & do þerto seto. Þis cauterie is good for passiouns of þe
iȝen, & for epilenciam, & for oþere sijknessis of þe heed; but þis
cauterie is not so good as þat oþer tofore.  Also þou miȝt make a
cauterie in a mannes necke bytwixe þe boonys & þe skyn aboueforþ  ; þis cauterie is good for þe spasme. 
Also whanne a man is woundid in þe heed, þis cauterie is good for drede
of þe spasme; for herwiþ þe mater schal be consumed, þat nerues ben redi
for to take.   Also in þe welle vnder þe eeris & bihinde þe
eeris þou schalt make cauterijs for passiouns of iȝen and for akynge of
þe teeþ.  Superfluite of fleisch þat is vpon a mannes browis, þou
schalt do awei wiþ a cauterie þat is clepid lingual,  schape
as it were a tunge of a brid. & þou schalt make þerwiþ cauterijs vpon
his browis, but þou muste be war þat þou touche not þe natural
substaunce of þe browis. & þou schalt make cauterijs þervpon with
cauterium punctuale, & for to do awei superfluite of fleisch þat is in
þe corner of a mannes iȝe.  Superfluite of fleisch þat is in a mannes
nose, it mai be remeued awei wiþ cauterium acutum ouþer punctuale, for
to touche þerwiþ þe fleisch a litil & a litil til al þe superfluite be
take awei. & if þis superfluite be fast þeron & be fer yn, þan þou muste
vse a sutil cauterie, & putte it in þe nose-þril


      

þoruȝ þe canel, þat þe hete ne mowe not harme þe substaunce of þe nose,
but oonly brenne þe superfluite of þe fleisch.  Also þou schalt make a
round cauterie vndir a mannes chyn. & þis cauterie is good for wennys
þat ben in þe skyn of his face, & for þe place,  & for þe palet, & for sijknes in a mannes mouþ, &
in þe gomys, & in þe teeþ.  Also þou miȝt make .ij. cauterijs in boþe a
mannes armys, wiþoutforþ þe arme, in þe welle þat is vpon þe grete braun
a litil  bineþe þe schuldre. & þis cauterie is good for
sijknes þat ben in þe partie bihinde of a mannes brayn as for þe
litarge,  & also
it purgiþ wel þe nerues of þe necke  Also þou miȝt make anoþer in þe
welle vndir þe grete braun, and is good for þe brayn wiþinneforþ as for
scotomia & vertigine, & for water þat falliþ adoun fro a mannes heed to
hise iȝen, & it is good for al passiouns of a mannes iȝen  Also þou
schalt make a cauterie cultellaria  bitwene a mannes fyngris  And þese cauterijs ben gode for
passiouns ciragra  Also þou schalt make cauterijs in þe brest wiþ a
round cauterie, and is good for asma   Also þou miȝt make a cauterie toward þe forke of þe brest aboue for
disma   Also þou miȝt sumtyme make cauterijs
in þe brest, þat ben clepid cultellaria, bitwixe þe ribbis, & þese
cauterijs been good for empima,  id est apostyme wiþinne  Also þou
miȝt make cauterijs punctualia in þe rigboon for gret akinge þat a man
haþ in þat place  Also þou miȝt make cauterijs wiþ a round instrument
vpon þe regioun of þe stomak, for long febilnes þat a man haþ had in his

cauterijs for sijknes of þe ballokis. & also it is good for wommen 
Also bitwixe þe toos ben maad cauterijs for þe potagre   Also
if þou purgist a man or a womman wiþ medicyns laxatiuis, & þan makist a

 A Mannes nose is sumtyme to-broken,  & sumtyme
pressid adoun. & if he be hastili holpen his nose mai be restorid aȝen,
& if it be longe or he haue ony help, þanne he schal be maymed for

þis maner  putte yn þe fingir of þe lifthand anoon to þe brekyng, þi
leeste fyngir or what fyngir wole best yn, & wiþ þi riȝthond presse vpon
þe brekyng, & arere vpward wiþ þi fyngir withinneforþ, & presse wiþ þin

so longe þat he mowe passe aboue þe brekyng, & þan þis tent schal be
diȝt wiþ a litil wex hoot & a litil sotil poudre of mastik & sandal, &
schape þerof in þe maner of a candel, & þan putte it into his nose,
wiþoutforþ leie of consolidatiuis þat schulen be seid in þe antidotarie,
& abouteforþ þou schalt leie a defensif, & þou schalt binde his nose wiþ

mannes face  If þou miȝt not putte yn þi fyngir in his noseþrel, þan
make a tent of tre & hile it wiþ lynnen clooþ þat it be oold & neissche,
& þan anointe þis tent wiþ oile of rosis, & putte þis in his noseþrel in

wiþoutforþ make his nose euene til þe boon be brouȝt in his propre place
þat is to-broke.  Of his dietyng, & blood-letyng, & ventusis, &

it is aforseid.

 If a manes cheke-boon  withoute wounde, putte þi ryȝt

yn þi strongist fyngris of þi lifthond tweyne & bringe þe boon into his

daies þis boon mai be restorid aȝen 


          ffor brekyng of þe forke of þe þrote and of þe brest 
          

The cheke-boon aboue meueþ not, & þat is for .iij. causis: oon is þat þe
cheke-boon bineþe is more liȝt & more able þerfore, Þe .ij. cause is
þis: þe cheke-boon is niȝ noble lymes, & if þe cheke-boon aboue meuede,
þe noble lymes miȝten be enpeirid þerbi. Þe .iij. cause is þis: if þe
cheke-boon aboue meuede, þere nolde be noon strong coniunccioun bitwene
hem  Þerfore þe cheke-boon aboue is fast maad to þe boonys of þe heed,
as it is aforseid in anothomiam.  The cheke-boon bineþe is maad of .ij.
boonys ioyned  togidere in þe chyn. & þis boon is maad fast
with þe cheke-boon aboue wiþ ligaturis þat ben stronge & recching & wiþ
lacertis, & maketh þe cheke-boon meue whanne a man wole, for summe þerof
comeþ adoun fro þe boonys of þe heed, & ben ioyned wiþ partijs of nerues
of þe heed, & of nuche, & closiþ togidere þe cheke-boon.  ] bineþe aforȝens þe brest,
and ben medlid wiþ nerues of nuche & openeþ þe cheke-boon, & summe comeþ
fro þe sidis, &


      

meueþ þe cheke-boon round, whanne a man couwid.  &
þis cheke-boon bineþe mai be brouȝt of þe ioynct fro þe cheke-boon aboue
in .ij. maners: ouþer it goiþ of þe ioynct bihindeward, & þan þe teeþ
þat ben in þe cheke-boon bineþe goiþ wiþinne þe teeþ of þe cheke-boon
aboue. & þan he may not opene his mouþ, & it goiþ out of þe ioynct
forward, & þan þe teeþ þat ben in þe cheke-boon bineþe goiþ forþere out
þan þe teeþ aboue. & he mai not close his mouþ togidere   These signys ben certeyn whanne
þe boon is out of his ioynct  It is greet nede for to helpe a man
hastily in þis caas; for if þe  cheke-boon be out of ioincte
longe, þere ben manie nerues & lacertis & arterijs & veines aboute þat
place, & for þis cause it wexiþ hard anoon. & þis place wole soone take
enpostym for divers humours þat wolen falle þerto. & if þer falle an
enpostym in þis place, þan, for þe brayn is so niȝ, þer comeþ a frenesie
þerof & ofte tyme dieþ  & þerfore if he be hastili holpen, þe boon wole
liȝtly into þe ioinct aȝen. & þerfore þat ioinct haþ liȝt meuynge  ffor
eueri ioinct þat haþ hard meuynge, & he be out of þe ioinct, it wole be
hard for to bringe yn aȝen  If it so be þat þe cheke-boon be out of
ioinnct hindeward, þan þou schalt take þe boon first wiþ þi .ij. hondis,
& lete a man holde his heed & drawe þe boon forþward.  & if it so be þat his mouþ be closid togidere, þan
þou schalt opene his mouþ wiþ þin hond or with sum oþer instrument, &
þan take faste þe boon & drawe it to his place aȝen. & in þis maner þou
schalt knowe whanne it is in his propre place aȝen, if his teeþ sitten
euene, & if he may opene his mouþ   If þou miȝt not bringe þe boon to
his propre place in þis maner, þan þou muste take a strong boond, &
sette it vndir his chyn, þere þou  settist þi fyngris, &
anoþer man mote drawe þe boond strongly & euene, & wiþ a wagge þou muste
opene his mouþ. In þis maner


      

þou openynge his mouþ, & he drawing wiþ þe boond as it is aforseid, al
at oonys wiþouten drede þe boon wole come into his ioynet.   If it be out of þe ioinct
forward, þan þou schalt sette a strong boond vpon his chin, þat it hile
al þe chin, & lete a man stonde bihinde him & halde þe boond in hise
hondis, & he schal sette his knees vpon his schuldris, & he schal drawe
þe boon to him wel & euenly. & þou schalt putte a wegge in his mouþ, &
whanne he drawiþ þe boon þou schalt opene his mouþ wiþ þe wegge al at
oon tyme, & in þis maner þ boon schal falle into his ioinct. Whanne þe
boon is ynne, þan binde it faste wiþ a ligature & with enplastre, & lete
him haue souping metis, & he schal chewe no mete til þe place be al
fast   If it so be þat þou were not at þe first bigynnyng, & þe place
is enpostymed, & he haue þe feuere & akynge of his heed, þan schaue his
heed & anoynte it wiþ oile of rosis & a litil vinegre medlid þerwiþ. &
þou schalt  anoynte his heed with sum mollificatif, or wiþ
dokis grese or wiþ hennys. & þou schalt worche as miche as þou miȝt for
to acesse þe enpostym, & for to cure þe feuere, & for to comforte his
heed, þat þe frenesie ne come not to him  Whanne þe feuere & þe
frenesie & þe enpostym be remeued awei, þan cure him as it is aforseid 


          ffor brekyng of þe forke of þe þrote and of þe brest  

THe forke of þe þrote is clepid of summen patena, & of summen cathena.
 Sumtyme it is to-broke & nouþer part of þe boon ne is not
ypressid yn, & þan þe cure þerof is liȝt ynow. But if þat oon ende of þe
boon be pressid adoun vndir þat oþer, þan it is ful hard for to bringe
it yn aȝen. Whanne nouþer partie is pressid adoun, þan it is noon oþer
nede for to haue no medicyn but stupis wet in white of eiren; & leie it
vpon þe brekynge of þe boon, & binde wel þe place wiþ ligaturis; & his
arme of þe same side mote be hongid to his necke, & in his arme-pitt þou
schalt leie a bal of lynnen clooþ. & þou muste binde his arme þat he
mowe not meue his arm  toward þe forke of þe brest, & in þis
maner he mote


      

be kept til þe boon be al hool.  If it so be þat oon ende of þe boon be
pressid adoun, þan a man mote drawe his oon arme, & anoþer man his oþere
arme, & þou schalt wiþ þin hondis drawe þe boon to his propre place. Þan
þou muste haue a medicyne consolidatif, & wete þerinne a lynnen clooþ, &
hile al þe brekyng of þe boon þerwiþ, & leie þervpon faldellas
 wiþ white of an ey,
& þan binde him as it is aforseid, and his arme to his necke, & in þis
maner he schal be kept til he be hool.


           Of brekyng of rigboonys  

RIgge boonys for her schortnes & for her strongnes ne ben not to-broke,
but if it be wiþ greet smytyng, & sumtyme þei ben brusid, & þat makiþ
greet akynge. Also þer falliþ manie perels of þe boonys of þe necke if
þei ben hurt, lest nucha be hirt also, & þan it is perel of þe brayn as
it is aforsed  If þou seest yuel signes in þat caas, go awei þerfro. &
if þou seest noon yuele signys, þan anointe þe place wiþ oile of rosis
hoot & leie þervpon wolle, and þanne  terbentine medlid wiþ
a litil mastic, & þis medicyne þou schalt vse til þe place be al hool 

 The noumbre of a mannes ribbis is aforeseid in þe anothamie  A mannes
ribbis ben to-broke sumtyme wiþ smytyng or wiþ fallyng  Also þei moun
be plied inward & not to-broke.  In þis maner þou schalt knowe wheþir a
mannes rib be to-broke or no  Sette þi fyngris vpon þe place & grope
softli & presse a litil vp & doun, & if his rib be to-broke, þou schalt
heere hym sownie,  &
he schal haue couȝinge & akinge in his side.  It is ful hard for to
restore a rib þat is to-broke, for sumtyme þat oon parti plieþ inward, &
þan it is hard for to bringe him into his propre place aȝen  And summen
seien þat þe pacient schulde ete metis to swelle him þat engendriþ
wijnd, & wole make þe rib goon into his propre place aȝen. & summen
seien þat me schulde sette a ventuse, & wiþ


      

þe drawing þerof þe rib wole rise vp aȝen into his propre place  But I
suppose þis wole more make agreuaunce þan helpe þe patient  ffor þe .j.
wole engendre an hoot enpostyme  The .ij. it wole drawe to
þe place manie humours  If þou wolt take þis cure, þou schalt do in þis
maner:  ffirst þou schalt lete him blood in þe side aforȝens in þe
veyne þat is clepid basilica, & þan in þe same, & þan anoynte þin hond
wiþ terbentine. & loke if þou miȝt take vp þe rib þat is pressid adoun.
& þin oþer hond þou schalt sette vpon þe place þat is not pressid adoun.
& wiþ þin hond þat is anoyntid arere vp his rib. & loke þat þe .ij.
endis of þe ribbis þat is to-broke come euene togidere, & þan make þe
patient to couȝe, for þis þe beste maner for to bringe him yn   If
þou dredist nouȝt greet replecioun of his bodi, þou miȝt opene a ventuse
whanne þe rib is ioyned. & þan þou schalt binde wiþ a boond, & vndir þe
boond þou schalt leie lynnet or sum oþer neische þing. & þou schalt
binde him in sich a maner þat þe rib þat is to-broke ne mowe not remoue
ne falle adoun aȝen. & þe patient schal vse liȝt mete as pultes de
caudarisio,  de amido, de tritico, wiþ
penides, & he schal drinke swete wijn temperatli, & þou muste defende
 him fro wraþþe & fro crijnge, & fro alle þingis þat wolen
make a man to couȝe.  If it so be þat þe akynge aceese not, & þou ne
miȝt not bringe his rib as he schulde be, & if he haþ greet cowȝynge &
acces of þe feuere, 
whanne þou hast lete him blood, þan þou muste kutte þe skyn aforȝens þe
rib þat is to-broke, & vnhile þe same rib of al his fleisch, & þan wiþ
instrumentis & wiþ þin hond þou muste drawe vp þe rib, & bringe him in
his place as he schulde be. & þan þou schalt cure þe wounde as it is
aforseid   His dietynge schal be as of pluretici til þe feuere & al

          Of brekyng of þe helpers of þe rigboon.

Adiutorium is to-broken ful ofte ouerþwert wiþ breking  Þe nere þat it
be þe ioynct, þe more perilous it is, & þe worse for to cure  In þis
place I wole telle þee in what maner þou schalt knowe a brekyng, & in
what maner þou schalt restore it aȝen, þat


      

it mowe be an ensample to þee in þe breking,  if a mannes arme & his leggis & his hipe-boon ben

him, & take his arme faste bi þe elbowe, & meue his arme hidir & þidir
liȝtli til þou heere sownynge of þe boon, & whanne þou knowist þe place

priuy þat no partie of þe boon goiþ in no side out  Whanne þou knowist
where þe breking is, or þou bigynne ony þing for to worche þeron, make
redi alle þi necessarijs þat ben gode for þe bindyng.  First þou schalt
make stupis þat ben euene, & wete hem in hoot water in winter, & in
coold water in somer, & þan wrynge out þi stupis þerof & diȝte oile of
rosis & a defensif of bole, & ij. longe boondis þat þei be .iiij.
fyngris brood, & lynnen clooþ þat mowe go aboute al his arme, & a strong

muste diȝte smale ȝerdis of drie tree, þat be strong & sotil. & whanne
þou hast diȝt alle þese þingis redi, þan sette þe boon in his place as
liȝtli — — —  with þin hond wiþouten greuaunce. & þan take 
oold soft lynnen clooþ, & wete it in oile of rosis, and wijnde it aboute
his arme. & vpon þis leie a clooþ wiþ medicyns consolidatif, þat schal
be seid in þe antidotarie for brekynge of boonys; & þerfore þese .ij.
lynnen cloþis moten be large for to hile al þe brekyng  And þou muste
haue cloutis in .ij. sidis of þe place þat is to-broke, & þervpon þou
muste leie faldellam in boþe sidis euene, & wet in gleire of an ey. &
alle þese þingis þou schalt binde wiþ þi boond, þat schal be þe brede
of .iiij. fyngris, & long þat he mowe goon aboute manifoold. & sewe þe

þou schalt leie þi splentis  ; & wiþ a corde þat be brood,
& not round, þei schulen be bounden þervpon. & þou schalt streyne

Ther ben summen þat streynen so faste a manys lyme, þat þe spirit of

seeþ þat þe place is to-swolle, & askiþ of þe patient wher he haue miche

þis maner þe lyme wole rotie, & in þis maner þe patient mai falle into a

& .vij. daies in somer  & þan vnbinde it softly þat þe lyme ne meue

Sumtyme þe boonys of a mannys arme ben to-broke  boþe, &

& binde him wiþ astelles þat ben wel maad þerfore. & þouȝ þe fyngir ne

Whanne þe boon of þe coxe is to-broke or ony boon of þe foot, þan þou

          Of þe cure whanne a man is smiten in þe rigbon or ribbis.

It bifalliþ sumtyme þat a man is smyten or a man falliþ, & þan tendre

leie a plate of yuer  in þat side þat þe boon is aplied, &


      

þe vertu of þe yuer wole drawe þe boon as it schulde be, & bringe þe
boon into his propre plite 


          Of þe greuousnes of þe rigboon whanne he is out of ioyncte 

Dislocacioun of þe rigboonys is a greuous sijknes. It is aforseid in
anathomia how manie boonys ben in þe necke & in þe rig. & it is aforseid
in what maner  The firste boon in a mannes necke is bounden with manye
feble ligaturis, & þe ligaturis þerof ben recching  & feble, þat þei ne schulde lette þe meuynge of
þe heed  Þe boonys þat ben in a mannes necke beþ more feble þan ony
oþer rigboonys, & þerfore þei goiþ liȝtly out of þe ioynte, & it is ful
greet drede þerof  If þe hiȝeste boon of þe necke be oute of þe ioynct,
it is clepid decollacio, & it sleeþ a man anoon; for þat oþer boon þerof
pressiþ yn & stoppiþ a mannes breeþ anoon, & in þis maner it
sleeþ a man anoon  And if þe ioynct þat is bitwixe þe vij. boon &
þe .viij. be out of ioyncte, þan it wole stoppe þe weie of his mete, and
it wole lette þe weie of a mannes breeþ also  And if ony boon of þe
rigboon þat is bineþe þe .viij. boon be out of ioyncte, but if he be þe
raþere holpen, he schal lese his meuyng for euermore   And þerfore it is necessarie
as faste þat a mannes rigboon is out of þe ioynct, þat it be brouȝt yn
aȝen anoon, & principali þe firste boon of þe necke, for disiunccioun of
þat boon wole sle a man anoon, as it is forseid  If þou be in þe place,
take þe patient bi þe heeris, & sette þi feet vpon his schuldris, & so
þou schalt drawe vpward wiþ þin hondis, & presse adoun wiþ þi feet, &
bringe þe boon into his ioynct aȝen  Whanne þe .vij. rigboon  is out of his ioynct fro þe .viij. rigboon, itt mai ful litil
tyme lenger abide. & if it so be þat þis boon be pressid swiþe ynward,
it wole sle a man hastily, & it wole ful late be curid  If it so be þat
it mai be curid, þer is noon oþer cure þeron, but presse adoun his
schuldris  & drawe vp þe heed, as it is aforseid  If it so
be þat ony of þese boonys be out of þe ioynct outward, þat falliþ ful


      

seelde, þan sette þe boonys euene, & drawe his heed & presse adoun hise
schuldris  If it so be þat ony rigboon bineþe þe .viij. boon of þe
necke be out of ioyncte, if þe boon go ynward, it nile take no cure til
it sle him  And if it ne be not al out of þe ioyncte, but it pressiþ
nucha, alle þe lymes bineþe schulen lese her meuynge  If it so be þat
þe boon be out of þe ioyncte & go outward, it is incurable, for he schal
be euermore gibbosis, id est broken-riggid. Þis is þe cure þerof, if it
mai be curid  Arere vp þe boon & presse it  als so miche
as þou miȝt, wiþ þin hond, ouþer presse it yn with a playn tree, &
studie þou in þi witt as miche as þou miȝt for to presse it in aȝen; &
leie þervpon oon of þe consolidatiuis, & binde it faste  If it so be
þat þere leeue ony hardnes after þe tyme þat þe place is soudid, þan
make an enplastre of mollificatiuis þerto, þat þou schalt fynde in þe
antidotarie; & anoynte him wiþ oynementis, þat þou schalt fynde  in þe same place in þe chapiter of mollificatiuis 


          Of þe schuldre out of his place. 

A Mannes schuldre mai go out of þe ioynct in .iij. maners  Oon maner is
þis, whanne þe heed of þe boon of adiutorie, þat is þe poynt of þe
schuldre, falliþ adoun vndir þe arme-pitt; & sumtyme he goiþ of þe
ioynct forþward, but þat falliþ ful selden  The .iij.: he goiþ out of
þe ioynct vpward; & bakward he ne mai not out of þe ioynct, for þe
schuldre boon holdiþ itt faste in.   The .j.
maner þou miȝt liȝtliche knowe bi touching & bi siȝt, & þou schalt fele
þe boon in his arme-pitt, & þan þere wole be a greet pitt aboue.  If he
be out of the ioynct forþward, þan his arme wole sitte bacward, & tofore
þou schalt se a greet pitt   If he be out of þe ioynct vpward, þat þou
schalt knowe in þis maner: his elbowe ne mai not be drawe along fro his
body. & if þou wolt drawe him along, þou schalt fynde an obstacle 
The .j. maner if it be a child, þan þou schalt take his arme wiþ þi
lifthond, & sette þi riȝthond vndir his  arme-pitt, & drawe
his arme wiþ þi lifthond, & presse þe boon into his ioynct wiþ þi
riȝthond; & in þis maner þou schalt bringe in þe boon of a child wel
ynow.  If it be a miche


      

man, lete him ligge adoun streiȝt, & take a round bal of tree, & folde
him wiþ a clooþ, & leie it vnder his arme-pitt, & binde him þere faste,
& take his hond & drawe it adounward, ouþer lete anoþer man drawe it
adounward, & helpe þou wiþ þin hond for to bring yn þe boon, so þat þou
schalt presse, & þe man drawe al in oon tyme  If it ne mai not be doon
in þis maner, þan ordeine a long perche, & make it fast in .ij. wallis
of þe hous, ouþer .ij. postis of þe hous; & in þe middil of þe perche
make a pitt, & in þe same pitt leie þe forseid bal, & þe hiȝnes of þis
perche schal be hiȝer þan a man is long, & þan sette vndir his feet a
stool. & loke þat þe same bal sitte vndir his arme, & lete a strong man
holde doun his arme and his hond, & take awei þe stool vndir his feet, &
in þis maner þe boon wole come into his ioynct   If it be out of þe
ioynct forþward, þan take a strong towail, & leie him vndir his arme, &
lete þe oon ende go forþ bihinde his rigge,  & þat oþer ende
forþ bi his brest, & lete a strong man holde þe .ij. endis of þe towail,
& þan binde his arme wiþ anoþer boond aboue þe elbowe; & take it anoþer
strong man, & lete þese .ij. men holde & drawe al at oonys; þan þou
schalt with þi .ij. hondis, whanne þei drawiþ, presse þe boon into his
ioynct  Whanne þe boon is in his ioynct, þan þei schulen leeue her
drawyng softly.  In þe same maner, whanne he is oute of ioyncte vpward,
he schal be bounden, & oon man schal drawe him abacward wiþ þe towal, &
þat oþer man schal drawe his arme adounward, & þou schalt helpe for to
presse yn þe boon wiþ þin hondis. & whanne þe boon is in his ioynct, þan
wete a pece of lynnen clooþ in oile of rosis, & þan þervpon leie a
medicyne consolidatif, & þan leie þervpon faldellas wet in gleire of
eiren, & binde him faste with boondis þat his arme ne mowe not out of þe
ioynct aȝen, & so he schal be bounden .x. daies. And if þer come ony
enpostym or icching, þan þou muste vnbinde him aȝen, & do awei þe
icching ouþer þe enpostym, and binde it aȝen as it is forseid.  If it
so be þat  þou ne were not at þe firste bigynnyng, þan þou
muste make þe patient a baþ of malue & bismalue, fenigrec, lynseed. &
whanne he is wel baþid in þis baþ, þan anoynte him wiþ an oynement
laxatif. & in þis maner he muste be baþid manie daies til þe place be
wel moistid; & þan bringe þe boon into his ioynct, as it is forseid. 
If it so be þat þou come at þe firste bigynnyng, whanne a boon is out of
þe ioynct, þan þou schalt not baþe þe lyme in hoot water in no maner.


      

 A mannes arme wole out of þe ioynct liȝtlich at þe elbowe,  & liȝtly it wole be brouȝt
into his ioynct aȝen  But he mai be out of þe ioynct in .ij. maners, as
forþward & hindeward, & boþe haueþ diuers cure  In þis maner þou schalt
do whanne he is out of þe ioynct forþward: sette stupis in þe folding of
his arme,  & þan binde
a boond þervpon, & lete a man drawe þat boond bakward — —,  & þan lete a strong man holde adiutorium, lest
his schuldre go out of þe ioynct. & þan anoynte þin hond wiþ oile of
rosis, & lete þe ij. men drawe al at oon tyme, & þan presse yn þe boon
into his ioynct wiþ þi .ij.  hondis, & þan hange an heuy
peis at his hond. & if þer leeueþ ony greet þing, lete it be til anoþer
tyme. & þan anoynte þin hond & presse it in aȝen, & þan þou schalt binde
him with boondis & faldellis, & oile of rosis & consolidatiuis, as it is
aforseid  But of þis caas þou muste be war: but if his arme be brouȝt
into þe ioinct hastili, þere wole engendre in þe place an hoot enpostym,
& þan aftirward it wole be ful hard to bringe it into his ioynct aȝen.

 Rasceta, þat is þe ioynct of þe hand  as it is forseid in anathamia,
is conteyned of manie boonys & of manie recchinge ligaturis, 
as it was necessarie for þe grete meuyng of þe hond. Þis place wole
liȝtly out of þe ioinct, & liȝtli it wole come yn aȝen.  But if a
mannes hond be out of þe ioyncte longe, þe place wole enpostym, & þan it
wole be hard for to bringe it in aȝen.  In þe firste bigynnyng take his
arme wiþ þi lifthond, & sette þe boon into þe ioynct as it is aforeseid,
& binde it in al maners as it is aforseid in oþere ioinctis.  Also if a
mannes fyngir be out of ioyncte, it is but liȝt for to putte it  in aȝen  In þe same maner þou schalt binde a mannes fyngir as it
is aforseid in oþere placis  Ther ben


      

manie men þat whanne a mannis lyme is out of ioynct, þei wolen sette þe
lyme in hoot water, & seien þat it wole þe better come into his ioinct
aȝen  But þou schalt wite þis, þat hoot watir in þe firste bigynnyng
makiþ þe lyme recche, & febliþ it & drawiþ þerto manye humours  &
þerfore þou ne schalt do in þis maner, but þou schalt comforte þe lyme
wiþ oile of rosis, & sette him into his ioinct anoon, & defende as miche
as þou miȝt, þat þere come noon enpostym þerto  But if it so be, þat
þou ne come not at þe firste bigynnyng, & þe place bicome hard, þan make
him a fomentacioun wiþ a decoccioun of þingis þat makiþ moist & resolueþ
as it is aforseid 


          Of the haunche out of his place. 

Al þe coniunccioun of þe haunche is tofore seid in þe chapitre of
anathamia. And þis place mai go out of þe ioinct in .iiij. maners: as
ynward & outward, forþward & bacward; & sumtyme it comeþ of causis
wiþinneforþ, & sumtyme of causis withoutforþ   Of causis
wiþinneforþ: as humours of longe tyme haue falle þerto, as it is
aforseid in þe chapitre of dolour of ioinctis  Ther is in þis place a
greet box, & conteineþ a greet place, þat beriþ al þe bodi, & it is a
place þat takith miche moisture & greet superfluite of humouris, &
whanne þer falliþ manie superfluitees to þat place, & þe pacient is not
purgid þerof, & traueiliþ, þan humours rotiþ in þat place, & þe
ligaturis recchiþ along, & in þis maner vertebrum goiþ out of his
ioinct  And þis caas in diuers men haþ diuers causis  ffor summen
haueþ a box in her haunche swiþe holowe, & þat wole not fulliȝtliche out
of þe ioinct  And summen ne haueþ not so holowe boxis, & þan if þe
place be ful of yuele humours, þan þe boon wole liȝtliche out of þe
ioincte, & it wole liȝtli into þe ioinct aȝen, & þan it wole liȝtly out
aȝen.  Of causis wiþoutforþ, as of wrastyng or of smityng or of sum
oþer þing þat makiþ vertebrum goon out of þe ioynct wiþ violence.  This
is þe signe whanne it is out of ioyncte ynward: whanne þou myȝt fele þe
poynt of þe boon in his flank, & his feet  & his knee turned
outward, & þe pacient schal not opene his leg ne his hipe  If it goiþ
out of þe ioynct forþward, þan his leg wole wexe miche schorter, & he
schal not bringe his hele to grounde, but oonly his toos.  If


      

it be out of þe ioynct bacward, þan his hele wole wexe long, & his toos
schorte, & he schal bringe no þing of his foot to groude, but his hele 

Ther ben manie maners of diuers menys for to bringe boonys into her
ioynct aȝen, but among alle I holde þis maner þe beste for þis place:
take a long schete þat be not brood, & do bitwixe þe patient leggis, &
lete þat oon ende go bifore his brest, & þat oþer bihinde his rig, &
make þe .ij. endis fast to a post, & þe patient schal ligge vpon a plain
place, & þou schalt binde al his hipe aboue his knee, & þan þe leg
softly adounward, & to alle þese boondis make faste a corde, & lete þe
moost fastenyng be in þe hipe aboue þe knee, & þan lete oon strong man
or ij. drawe þe corde euenlich & harde withoute ony pluching.  & þan þou schalt wiþ þin hondis putte þe
boon into his ioyncte. & whanne þe  boon is ynne, þan bidde
hem lete go þe corde softli aȝen, & leie hise feet euene togidere. for
if hise feet wollen ligge euene togidere, it is a certein signe þat þe
boon is in his ioynct. & if hise feet wolen not sitte euene in þe
ioynct, it is a signe þat þe boon is not in his ioynct  whanne þe boon
is in his ioinct, binde faste his hipe, & lete þe patient ligge stille
til he be al restorid  In alle curis of dislocacioun þou hast pleiner
teching. 

 Dislocacioun of þis place þat comeþ of causis wiþinneforþ, it is ful
hard for to bringe it in aȝen. & þouȝ þe boon be brouȝt in aȝen, wiþ a
litil cause it wole goon out aȝen. & þerfore þer is no cure þerof, but
avoide his bodi, & make him cauterijs as it is aforseid in þe chapitre
of cauterijs.

 A mannys knee is sumtyme out of ioyncte, & sumtyme þe round boon þat
is þervpon goiþ out of his place  Signys whanne a mannes knee is out of
ioyncte ben open ynowȝ. & if þe round boon be out of his place, þou
miȝte liȝtlich knowe it.  In þis maner þou schalt bringe a mannes knee
into his ioynct aȝen  Lete a strong man holde faste his hipe, and
 anoþer man his leg. & þou schalt wiþ þin hondis presse
faste þe boon into his propre place. & if þe place be enpostymed, first
þou muste do awei þe enpostym, & þan bringe þe knee into his place aȝen.
 If þe round boon be out of his place, sette þe boon into his place, &
þan binde faste wiþ boondis, & þan binde his leg faste vp to his hipe bi
an hour, & þan


      

vnbinde his leg fro his hipe, & þan binde faste þe round boon þat it ne
moue not fro his propre place, & in þat maner lete it sitte, for it wole
bicome fast anoon.

 If þe ioynct of a mannes foot be out of ioyncte or his toos, þou
schalt do þe cure in þe same maner as it is aforseid in þe hond & in þe
fyngris.   Þoruȝ þe help of god wiþout
which is no þing fulfillid, þe .iiij. tretis is fulfillid.  Now I wole
bigynne þe .v. tretis þat schal be clepid þe antidotarie of this book. 

In þe fifþe tretis clepid þe antidotarie of þis book, I þinke to  putte medicyns boþe symple & compound  þat falliþ for cirurgie &
beþ necessarie þerfore  But I ne mai not sette alle, for þer is no man
þat can telle alle þe noumbre of medicyns but oonli god  Neþeles I wole
sette medicyns in þis antidotarie þat I haue longe vsid, & I lernede hem
of wise doctouris & of philosophoris, & alle þei ben aproued 


          Here bigynneþ þe tretise of repercussiuis 

Repercussiuis bifalliþ for hoot apostymes, & principal whanne it
bigynneþ in a noble lyme: as in þe herte, ouþir in þe brayn, ouþir in þe
heed, ouþir in þe lyuere, þe splen & þe stomac, reynes, ballokis, & in
þe bladdre  It schal alwei be þin entencioun for to putte awei greuous
mater fro a noble lyme into anoþer place.  Whanne þou wolt worche wiþ
repercussiuis, þou muste take hede to .x. condiciouns þat ben sett in þe
iij. tretis in þe general chapitre of enpostyms   Repercussif is seid
in .ij. maners: as large & streit   large is seid: as eueri medicyne maad of coold herbis for to
aquenche hoot  causis. Streit is seid, whanne it putt awei
þe mater & is not swiþe coold  Of repercussiuis þere ben manie degrees
of cooldnes  Ther ben summe so coold, þat a man mai not fele his lyme,
& þan it is clepid stupefactiua   & þis þou schalt vse whanne þer is þing þat greueþ more þan

dredist þe mater, þan þou schalt vse medicyns þat ben coold & drie, þat
þei mowe tempere þe complexioun of þe lyme, & wiþ þe vertu of stiptica

Epithima is þis, whanne þingis ben sotilli poudrid & temperid wiþ water

but in þe meene, & it schal be leid

but propirli pultes ben clepid, whanne þer is mele, watir, & oile
wiþouten herbis, & it schal be clepid cataplasma, whanne herbis ben

hoot watir, wiþouten ony decoccioun of herbis þeron, & þat hoot watir
schal be cast vpon þe lyme from an hiȝ, & so it schal be do longe, & þis
is clepid embrocare.   Encatisma
is seid in .ij. maners: sumtyme it is seid for a clisterie, & sumtyme
for a particuler ,6 anoon to þe nauele & non aboue þe nauel 

 Medicyns þat ben compound togidere: Whanne þou entendist for to make a

þat ben coold þre partis, olei rosis oon part, of vinegre half a part, &
medle hem togidere. If þat þou wolt þat it worche more strongely, þan do
þerto argillam rubeam  til it be as þicke as it were epithima, & leie
it to þe place. & herof þou must take kepe, þou schalt vse þingis þat
ben able for a mannes complexioun  In þis maner if þou leist coold
þingis to a place,   & ne hast not þi purpos þerof, þan
þou schalt leeue þe coold medicyns, & make medicyns þat ben competent to
þe same complexioun  for sum medicyne is for peter þat is not good for
poul, for þe diuersite of complexioun. & al þis teching þou miȝt fynde
generalich in þe tretis of enpostyms.  ffor if peter be of complexioun
hoot & moist, & poulis complexioun be coold & drie, oon repercussioun
wole not serue hem boþe in oon point. & for þis cause þou muste diuerse
þi medicyns; for þis is al dai preued bi experiment as þou miȝt se ofte
tyme, þat crassula maior is a good repercussif for coold mater,


      

& vmbilicus veneris is coold in þe same degre, & ȝitt it is not so good

place bicome ledi, þan þou schalt contynue nomore wiþ pure coold þingis;
but do þerto iuys of coriandre grene & barli mele, for þis makiþ coold &
resolueþ.  If þer be no ledi colour but þe mater is greet, & nyle not
be doon awei wiþ repercussiuis, whanne þe flux of humours is acesid, þan
biginne for to medle þerwiþ resolutiuis; ȝitt þou schalt contynue wiþ
repercussiuis þere þat þer is greet akynge  an ensaumple hereof  If þe
akinge be in a mannes knee, þan þou schalt first leie medicyns vpon þe
knee, & þan aftirward þou schalt not leie it riȝt vpon his knee, but a
litil aboue his knee, þat þe ende of þe medicyn mowe touche þe firste
parti of þe akynge.

 Coold mater as it is aforseid, ne schal not be putt awei wiþ
repercussiuis, but wiþ medicyns þat ben hoot and  drie in
tempere, þat þei mowe wiþ her heete chaunge þe coold complexioun, & wiþ
her dreines comforte þe vertu of þe lyme, & defende þat þer come no more
mater to þe lyme, & if þe mater be litil, putte it awei, & if þou ne
wolt not putte it awei, defende þe place þat þer falle nomore mater
þerto   And
alle þese ben hote wiþ a maner bittirnes: as absinthium, squinantum,
abrotanum, polium, sticados, centaurea maior & minor,  aristologia
longa & rotunda, mauribium, 


      

mirta, mastix, lupini, oleum de masticis, & de absinthio  Herof þou
shalt take kepe: manie men seien, & it wole liȝtly be leeued of lewid
men, & þat is yuel þing for to leie a repercussif to ony mater for to
driue it awei, but it is bettir to drawe out þe mater wiþ enplastris, &
if þer comeþ out þerof miche quitture, þei seien þat a mannes bodi is
wel purgid þerwiþ, & schal be longe þe holer þerfore  And if þe mater
be doon awei wiþ repercussiuis & þe enpostym be defendid, þan if þe same
man be sijk aftirward, þan men wolen seie þat it was defaute in þe
leche, for if þe enpostym hadde be maad maturatif  & þe
quitture drawe out, þan þe man hadde be hool, & alle þese opiniouns ben
false  And þou schalt wite þis certeynli: if þou takist kepe of þe .x.
consideraciouns þat ben forseid in enpostyms, & principali whanne his
body is maad clene wiþ laxatiuis þat ben competent þerfore  It is
bettir to putte awei þe mater wiþ comfortyng of þe lyme, þan lete þe
mater conferme  for if þou kepist wel þe condiciouns þat ben aforseid,
the mater mai be putt awei, & þe man schal not be peirid 


          Of þe maner of resolutiuis.

Whanne oon strong, or  manye feble of .x. causis lettiþ
repercussiuis, ouþir whanne þou hast a repercussif, & þou ne miȝt not
putte awei þe mater, þan þou muste leie þerto resolutiuis. & as it is
aforseid of repercussiuis, in þe same maner I seie of resolutiuis:
whanne a man haþ akynge ouþir greet swellynge, þou schalt leie þerto no
resolutiuis, or þou haue maad him a competent purgacioun.  fforwhi, as
it is aforseid, enpostym ouþer greet akynge comeþ of causis wiþinneforþ,
þan it mote  nedis come of repleccioun of þe bodi. & þan if
þou leist þerto resolutiuis, þat wolde drawe to þe place more mater 
for þer is no resolutif, þat ne it is hoot  & eueri þing þat is hoot,
is attractif  What schal we do in þis caas?  ffirst þou schalt lete
him blood, ouþir make him a medicyn laxatif, ouþir boþe two, as þou
seest þat it wole spede  And þan þou schalt bigynne for to resolue wiþ
medicyns resolutiuis þat been hoot & sotil   This is þe
difference bitwixe resolutiuis & maturatiuis:  Resolutiuis haueþ
tempere hete wiþ sotilnes & openynge. 


      

 Maturatiuis haueþ tempere hete wiþ viscosite  Þerfore it falliþ ofte
tyme, þat whanne þou leist resolutiuis vpon miche mater & greet, it
makiþ þe mater sotil & hoot, & þan þe kindely hete wiþinne is comfortid
wiþ þe hete wiþoutforþ, & it bifalliþ ofte tyme, þat medicyns
resolutiuis in þis caas makiþ þe mater maturatif  Also if þou leist
medicyn maturatif vpon litil mater & sotil it hetiþ þe mater, & þe
natural hete wiþinne is comfortid þerwiþ, & so þe heete multiplieþ, & in
þis maner þe heete  mai be resolued.  The maner of
resoluing: Make a decoccioun of herbis of whiche þow wolt make þi
medicyn, & kepe þe watir þat þe herbis ben soden yn, & wiþ þe same watir
þou schalt waische þe lyme, til it bicome reed, & þan leie þervpon þe
medicyn resolutif.  Herof þou muste be war, þat ofte tyme a medycyn
resolutif resolueþ þe sotil mater, & þat þat is greet, bicomeþ hard, &
þan þe more þat þou art aboute to resolue, þe more it wole bicome hard 
þerfore þou muste be bisi in þis caas & leie þerto mollificatiuis, & þan
þou schalt go to resolutiuis, & in þis maner þou schalt worche it til it
be al resolued.  Of medicyns resolutiuis, summe ben simple: as,
camomilla, Mellilotum, paritaria, malua siluestris & alia,  volibilis, ole, angl. berebinde."] fumus terre,
caulis, anetum, vrtica, enula, borago, sambucus, kebulus, valeriana, &

dredist woodnes of mater, þan þou ne schalt do þerto no fenigrec; for it

vj. part of oon & .; þese .iij. maturatiuis suffisiþ þee  
Also þis is a rule þat is ful profitable for þee  whanne þou wolt leie
ony maturatif to a place: first þou schalt make embrocam  to þe lyme wiþ a decoccioun of herbis maturatiuis,
soden in watir, & wiþ þat hoot watir þou schalt baþe þe lyme til þe lyme
bicome reed, & þan leie þeron a plastre of maturatiuis þat ben forseid
oon þerof, for þou hast sufficiently ynowe, & loke þat þe enplastre be
not to hard,  & as hoot as he mai suffre it þou schalt leie
it þerto   Thou hast herd sufficientli of maturatiuis, ynow it is nede
to speke of mundificatiuis. For whanne an hard matir is maad maturatif,
it is nede for to leie þerto mundificatiuis as it is forseid in þe
worchinge of enpostyms 


           Of þe tretis of mundificatiuis 

Mundificatum is as miche to seie as clensyng, & doiþ awei hore. & eueri
þing þat doiþ awei hore in woundis & superfluite, may be seid a
mundificatif  A mundificatif may be seid in .ij. maners  As a medicyn
þat is taken bi þe mouþ, ouþer þat is putt in bineþe wiþ a clisterie,
ouþer wiþ a pessarie  for to make
clene a mannes lymes wiþinne. & of þis kinde ben sirupis maad of seedis
þat makiþ clene a mannes lymes, & weies of þe vrine  And þer ben summe
medicyns þat makiþ clene a mannes blood as cassia fistula, manna,  tamarindi; & al medicyns laxatiuis mowen be clepid
mundificatiuis, & herof is not entencioun in þis caas   Anoþir. I wole
speke of medicyns mundificatif in cirurgie.  & þat is propirli seid a medicyn,
þat doiþ awei greet superfluite ouþer gret greuance  of
quitture, ouþer remeueþ  awei harde crustis in woundis,
ouþir in vlceribus, & makiþ clene woundis & vlcera of þat superfluite 
ffor as it is seid in anoþer place: In eueri wounde þat is holow, þat is
as miche to seie as whanne it haþ lost substaunce of fleisch þeron, þan
bi skille  þer schulde be engendrid þeron .ij.
superfluites, þat oon schal be greet, & þat oþer schal be sotil. & þese
wollen lette þe souding of a wounde, & þei wolen


      

lette þat þe fleisch mai not wexe.  Þan medicyn mundificatif remeueþ
greet superfluite. Of driynge medicyns, we wolen speke in þe chapitre
next  This maner medicyn schal go bifore regeneracioun &
consolidacioun, of whiche we wolliþ speke herafter; þouȝ aggregatiua or
conglutinatiua come sumtyme for to soude wiþouten þat, þat þis medicyns
ne goiþ not tofore, as whanne woundis ben sewid & ben maad hool wiþouten
regeneracioun of quitture. Þis medicyn makiþ clene, & drieþ sumwhat, as
water & hony whanne vlcera virulenta beþ waischen þerwiþ, ouþir woundis
in which agendriþ miche quitture; & sumtyme it is more strong, as whanne
þer beþ medlid þerwiþ poudris corosiuis þat han litil  vertu
of corosiuis, & helpiþ for to make clene, & whanne corosiuis ben seid
for to take awey yuel fleisch þat ne mai not be taken awei with medicyns 

Therfore I wole sette medicyns bi rule, & first I wole speke of medicyns
þat ben simple  ffor as me seiþ .x. siþis rehersid liketh a man.  
Thou schalt wite þis þat woundis þat ben freisch, þer it is no nede for

nede for to leie þerto mundificatiuis, but oonli consolidatiuis  But
whanne a woude is chaungid wiþ þe eir or enpostymed, or greet akynge,
þan þou muste leie þerto maturatiuis; & whanne þe akynge & þe oþere
accidentis ben awei, þan þou schalt bigynne for to leie þerto

is good for to do þerto a litil terbentyn waischen, whanne it is doon

          Of medicyns regeneratiuis & consolidatiuis.

It þinkiþ bi þe maner of speche þat þe medicyns þat ben seid in þis
chapitre ben al oon, but þer is miche difference bitwixe  ffor  of summen alle þei ben clepid consolidatiuis. But aggregatiue &
consolidatiue ben al oon  And regeneratiue, & incarnatiue, & facientes
carnem nasci, ben oon to seie; & þer is greet difference bitwixe hem þat
ben forseid & þese  And sigillatiuis, & cicatriȝatiuis, &
consolidatiuis ben al oon; neþeles alle þese names ben not propirli take
of alle auctouris  But oon herof is taken for anoþer ofte tyme  But
for to seie þe soþe, a medicyn þat is clepid aggregatum or
conglutinatum, & A. in diuers placis taketh diuersli þese names of
medicyns: & I suppose þat it were for defaute of men þat translatid þe
science  But for to seie þe soþe, aggregatiua or consolidatiua is a
drie medicyne, & haþ gummosite in him; & whanne it is leid to þe lyme,
it wole resolue wiþ his drienes. It drieþ vp superfluite of moistnes þat
is bitwixe þe lippis of a wounde, wiþ a litil ligature or sewing it
soudiþ togidere.  & A. clepiþ þis incarnatiuam, & summen clepen it
consolidatiuam, & ben þese  Sanguis draconis, calx, thus masculinum

grete woundis & leiden þervpon manie herbis, & weren hool in þe same
dai; & þei camen for to take of þe same herbis, & ne miȝten noon fynde
þat wolde do so more  A good medicyn for þis entencioun: ℞,
frankencense partem vnam, sanguis draconis partes duas, calcis viue
partes tres, & make herof poudre; & leie ynowȝ vpon þe .ij. lippis of þe
wounde þat is sewid togidere, as it is aforseid in þe chapitre of
woundis.  Anoþer poudre þat is good for þis entencioun; but in placis
þat is myche fleisch aweie, it is nede for to leie þerto þingis to
regendre fleisch, þat we wolliþ speke þerof soone heraftir. ℞, olibani
lucidi, aloes, sanguis draconis ana, make þerof poudre.  Anoþer comoun
for to streyne blood, & for to soude woundis: ℞, sarcocolle partes duas,
sanguis draconis, balaustie ana partem vnum,  olibani lucidi

 Medicyns forto regendre fleisch haueþ propriete forto congile blood,
þat comeþ to þe place wiþ tempere drienes, & makiþ þerof 
fleisch, & makiþ clene superfluite þat wexiþ þeron. & þis is in diuers
maner  ffor whi, if a lyme be woundid in þat maner þat it be nede for
to regendre fleisch þeron, & þe place is drie, & þer is miche quitture
in þe wounde, þan it is nede þat þou haue swiþe drijng medicyns.  If
þat he haue litil quitture & his bodi be moist, — — alle þese techingis
þou hast had tofore.   Medicyns þat ben liȝt þat þou schalt vse þere, þat þer is
litil quitture yn moist bodies: ℞, thus minutum, mastix, farina ordei,

orobum, aloes, mirra, pix greca, farina fabarum; & more strong þat þou
schalt vse in bodies: astrologia, yreos, farina lupinorum, dragantum
adustum, vitriolum adustum; for if it be brent it wole be þe lasse
bityng, & his drienes ne schal not be alaskid.  For .vij. causis diuers
þingis ben brent: Summe ben brent, for sum vertu in hem schulde wexe 
And summe þat þe malice þerof schulde goon awei: as mirabolani, þat
haueþ vertu of laxatif, & virtutem stipticam, for whanne it is brent his
vertu laxatif is maad lasse; & his vertu þat is clepid stiptica, is
neuer þe lasse, but it is þe more. In þe same


      

maner  vitriolum lesiþ his scharpnes, & his drienes is not
lost  The .ij. is þis, þat his greet substaunce mowe be maad sutil, as
cancri id est crabbis þat ben brent  The .iij. cause is þis, þat it
mowe gadere scharpnes, as stoonys, oistris, & schellis of eiren, þat ben

aparailid for to be grounden, as seta sericum   & among alle medicyns þat ben for þe herte þat mowe be

diȝte hem for to grinde  Seþe hem in sulfur in leed, þat þei mowe þe
bettir be grounde  The .v. cause is þis, þat þe wickidnes þerof mowe be
take awei: as of scorpiouns þat ben brent, þat we mowe vse hem in
medicyns, þat ben for þe stoon. The .vj. cause is þis, þat his vertu
mowe be maad þe more, as squillis whanne þei ben brent, her vertu wole

as psillium, whanne it is brent  his vertu wole be þe lasse  In what
maner þou schalt go fro medicyn to medicyn, þou hast it pleynerli ynowȝ
in þe first tretis,  boþe simple medicyns & also compound 
þe whiche þou miȝt vse as þou seest best to done  If þou wolt regendre
fleisch in a deep put þat vlcus is, take poudre of thuris, whanne vlcus
is  maad clene, & fille ful þe hole þerof, for it wole
engendre fleisch wel.  In þes vertues, & it is moost competent to
consolidatif medicyns.  & his
gummosite þat is clepid thus masculinum ouþer olibanum, & þat is best
for medicyns þat is conglutinatif, þat ben forseid in þe bigynnyng of
þis chapitre. & þe poudre of him, whanne it is maad smal & falliþ adoun
of a sarce, is clepid minutum thuris, & þat is best to regendre fleisch.

Bi þis maner distinccioun þou schalt gadere þe difference of þre
medicyns þat ben in þis chapitre, & of summen þei ben clepid alle
.  The .j. þerof þat is seid conglutinatif, þat makiþ
þe lippis of a wounde soude togidere  The .ij. it drieþ & makiþ clene,
& helpiþ blood for to turne into fleisch  The .iij. it drieþ wiþ vertu
þat is clepid stiptica, þat makiþ hard fleisch to arise in þe stide of
skyn.  This is a good medicyn for to regendre fleisch, þat is clepid
litargirum nutritum, þat is norischid  as it is


      

aforseid in þe chapitre de vlceribus.  Anoþer poudre þat engendriþ
fleisch  Take thuris minute, masticis, fenigreci ana, fiat puluis. Þis
poudre regendriþ fleisch wel & drawiþ, & nyle not suffre þat vlcus schal
stynke, but it makiþ for to haue a good sauour.  Also an oynement þat
is good for to regendre fleisch  ℞, litargiri nutriti  .ij,

for to regendre fleisch  But whanne poudre ne mai not come þerto to þe
botme þerof, þan þou muste leie þeron oynementis, for þe moisture of þe

for it drawiþ out quitture  ℞, olij lī. , resine  .j,

 If þou leist þis oynement in þe botme of a wounde, it wole drawe out
þe quitture & aswage þe akynge, & it wole make clene & regendre fleisch
in vlcera.  This þou muste knowe, þat þouȝ I sette proporcioun of

þan þou schalt do þerto þe lasse of þe poudre, & more of þe oile & of þe

Ouþir take anacardos & seþe hem in hoot tenaclis þat smiþis vsen, &
streyne hem, & þer wole distille þerof hony.  Also take þe wombis of

it wole make vlcera  But herof þou muste be war þat in what place þou
settist cantarides þer  wole come greet brennynge of vrine,
& sumtyme it makiþ so greet brennyng þat a mannes vrine is stoppid
þerwiþ. & þe cure þerof is þis  Seþe malue, paritorie, violet,
watircressen in watir, & lete þe patient sitte þeron anoon to þe nauele,
& herwiþ þe akyng schal be taken awei, & also he schal make vrine
liȝtlich  & herof þou schalt take hede, þat in what place of a mannes

þe cruste falle awei, & do awei þe aking, ben þese: ȝelkis of eiren wiþ
oile of rosis, þat is þe beste of alle medicyns  Also, take þe leeues &
grinde wiþ grese, ouþer wiþ buttir & leie þervpon  Also grese ouþir
buttir is good þerfore.  Also pultes maad of mele, oile & watir, ben
good þerfore & aceessiþ wel þe akynge & makiþ þe crustis falle.  Also
wiþ þe cauterie of an hoot iren þou miȝt   do awei deed fleisch, ouþir wiþ
oon of þe medicyns þat ben forseid.  Also if þou wolt


      

vse medicyns for to make cauterijs, þou muste take kepe of þis caas  In
feble men & in a litil cause þou muste vse feble medicyns, & þou muste
be war þat þou brenne no nerue ne no greet veyne ne noon arterie wiþ þi
cauterie, ne wiþ þi medicyns þat makiþ cauterijs.  Also in a strong man
& in a boistous man, þou miȝt worche at oonys þat þou muste worche at
manye tymes in a feble man  ffor in euery medicyns þat a leche doiþ he
schal take kepe of the strenkþe & of þe vertu of þe pacient 


          Of mollificatif medicyns or softenyng.

We vsiþ þese medicyns þat ben .iiij. in eueri cause.  Oon cause is þis,
whanne þe mater þat þou wolt resolue is swiþe hard, for þan oonli wiþ
resolutiuis as it is aforseid þe sotil mater wole resolue, & þat oþir
part wole bicome hard, & þan þou muste make mollificatiuis.  The .ij.
cause is þis, whanne ony lyme is to-broke ouþir out of þe ioyncte, þouȝ
it be broȝt  yn aȝen, þe place wole be hard, & þe patient
mai not meue þerwiþ, þan þou muste do  þerto
mollificatiuis til þe lyme be bettere as it is aforseid.  The .iij.
cause is þis, whanne ony lyme þat haþ ben out of ioynct longe tyme, þan
þou muste make þingis forto make þe place moist aȝen, þat þe boon mowe
come into his ioynt aȝen.  The .iiij. cause is, whanne a lyme is
corrupt & is yuel ioyned, & makiþ al þe lyme foul, as whanne a boon is
to-broken & is not ioyned, þan þou muste breke þe boon aȝen, & bringe it
into his propre place as it schulde be  In alle þese causis we mote vse
medicyns þat ben mollificatiuis, as ben þese: camomille, mellilotum,
fenigreci, semen lini, & almaner fatnes, & marowe, & manie gummis, &
euery medicyn þat is hoot & moist wole make a lyme mollificatif  A good
composicioun for þe firste cause  Take oold oile .iiij. partis, wex
partem .j., & make þerof an oynement, and anoynte þerwiþ a lyme þat þou
wolt resolue þe mater þat is þeron  ffor it wole make þe mater
mollificatif, & make þe poris  open to resolucioun  Anoþer
þat is more strong  ℞, radicis malua visci  .j., & kutte it to
smale gobetis, & putte hem in a morter wiþ  .iiij. of oile of
lilie. & þou schalt sett þis vessel of glas in hoot boilyng watir, &
þere it schal stonde til þe iuys of þe herbe be consumed. Wiþ þis oile
þou schalt anoynte þe place, & leie þervpon lanam succidam id est wolle

þou schalt wite, þat whanne þou wolt make þese oynementis, first þou
shalt make a fomentacioun wiþ hoot watir til þe place bicome reed. & if
þe place be swithe hard, þan take a stoon þat is clepid lapis molaris, &
make him hoot in þe fier, ouþir a greet gobet of iren, & do it in strong
vinegre. & þe place of a mannes lyme þat is hard, holde ouer þe fume þat
comeþ out of þe vinegre, & þan anoynte him aftirward  Þis is þe maner
for to make a lyme mollificatif, & þer ben .iij. maners.  Þe .j. maner is
þis: þou schalt make a decoccioun of flouris of camomille, mellilote,
fenigrec, semen lini, & rootis of malua visci, soden in water. & þou
schalt  make a fomentacioun to þe lyme in þis watir longe
tyme, & frote þe lyme softli. & þan anoynte þe lyme wiþ oon of þese
oynementis  ℞, auxungie porci antique sine sale  .iij,
pinguedinis anseris, anatis & galline ana  .j., melte hem alle
togidere & cole hem, & do þerto . j. of wex. Þis wole make
mollificatif, & restore moistnes. & if þou wolt make it for to be good
for drienes of a mannes brest, & good for men þat ben etik, do þerto
 .j of clene dragaganti, & þan it wole be a good oynement
restoratif.  Anoþir oynement. ℞, adipis porci antique sine sale

Now the Chapitelles of þis bok buþ y-ordeynde, y wyl fulfylle my purpos,
pursuynge every chapytell by ordere, & confermynge my wordys after þe
Autorite of myn Autores, & wiþ experyment þat y haue longe tyme y-vsyde
with help of god.

Al thynge þat we wolde knowe, by on of þre maneres we mowe knowe, oþere
by hys name ore by hys worchynge, oþere by hys verrey beynge schewynge
propirte of hym selff. In þis þre manere we mowe knowe surgerie by
expownynge of hys name; ffor syrugie cometh of syros, þat ys a word of
grewȝ, & in englyssche syros ys an hand, & gyros grewȝ, þat ys worchynge
an Englyssche; for þe ende & þe prophyte of surgerye ys of hand
wyrchynge. Of þe Name of a thynge Galyen seyth: he þat wyl knowe
soþfastnesse of a thynge, besye hym noȝt to knowe þe name  of
a thynge, bute þe worchynge & þe Effecte of þe same thynge; where fore
he þat wyl knowe surgerie ys, he mote vndirstonde, þat yt is a
medycineal sciense, whyche techiþ vs to worche with handes in Mannes
body, in


      

kuttynge ore opnynge þo partyes þat ben hol, & in helynge þo that ben
tobroken oþere kutte, as þey were to fore, oþere ellys as nyȝ as a Man
may, and al so in doynge aweye þat ys to myche above þe schyn: as
wertys, oþere wennys, oþer flesch to hyȝh.

 The secunde Chapitell of þe ffurste Tretys is of þe qualites, maners
and cunnynge of a surgien.

Nedfful ys þat a surgien be of a Complexioun wel proporcyonede, & þat is
complexioun be temperat. Rasys seiþ, whose face ys nouȝt semlye, ys
inpossible to hauen gode maners; & Auicenne: euyle maners beþ folwynge
þe lyknesse of an yuele complexioun. A surgien moste han handys wel
schape, longe smale ffyngres, and hys body nought quakynge, & alle hys
lymes able to fulfyllen gode werkynges of hys soule. He most ben of
sotyl wytt, ffor alle þynge þat longyth to surgerye may nought wiþ
lettres ben wryten. He moste stodyen in alle þe partyes of naturell
ffylosophye & in logyk, þat he mowe vndirstonde scriptures; in gramere,
þat he speke congrulyche; in art, þat techyth hym to preven ys
proposiciones with gode resoun; in retoryk, þat techith hym to speke
semlyche; be he non glotoun, non spowsbrekere, ne Envyous, ne no
nygarde; be he trewe, vmbelyche  & plesynglyche bere he hym-
self to hys pacientis; speke he non Rybaudye in þe seke mannys house, ne
in þe seke


      

Mannes house gif non counseyle bote he be y-askyde, ne speke he with non
womman in no  folye in þe seke Mannes howse, ne
chyde nought with þe seke Man ne with none of hys meyne; but curteslye
speke to þe syke man, & in alle manere syknesse behote hym hele, þowȝ
þou be of hym dyspeyred; but neuere þe lattere seye to hys frendys, þe
cas as yt stant. Loue he non harde curys, & entyremete he nought of þo
þat beþ in dyspeyre. Pore men helpe he be hys myght, & of ryche men aske
he gode rewarde. Preyse he nought hymselff with hys owne mouth, ne blame
he nought scharplye oþere lechys; loue he alle lechys & Clerkys, & by
hys myght make he non leche hys enmye. So cloþe he hym with vertues, þat
of hym mowe a-rysen gode fame & name, & þis techyth Etyk. So lerne he
ffysik, þat he mowe with gode rulys hys Surgerye deffende, & þat techith
ffysik. Naþeles yt ys necessarye a surgien to knowe alle þe partyes in
eche sengle partye of a medycine, ffor ȝif a surgien knowe noȝt þe
sciens of Elementis, whiche þat buþ furst Meverys of naturel þynges & of
dyuerse lymes, he may noȝt knowe sciense of coniunctiounes, þat ys to
seye, medlynges & complexiouns þat beþ necessarye to hys crafte. A
surgien most knowe þat alle bodyes þat ben medlyde, þat ben vndire þe
cercle of þe Mone, ben engendryd


      

of foure symple bodyes, here lyknesse eche in oþere medlyng; þat ys to
sugge, fyr & eyre, erþe & water. Þese elementys, ffor þe outemast ende &
outemast contraryousite of here qualites, weren fer drawen from bodily
lyffe; but whanne here  qualytes, þat is to sugge manere of
beyinge, comyn in to medlynge, so þat þe leste partye of þat on entre in
to þe leste partye of þat oþere partye, medlynge brekyth here
contrariosite, & þere of comme a newe forme & a newe complexioun of þe
medlynge of here substaunce. Al so þe medlynge of þe qualitees & þe
quantites ys fer drawyn from þe contraryousite of þe same elementes, &
so complexioun is nyȝh brought to a mene, & so þat þat ys medlyde ys
more able to resseyuen þe noble forme of lyff, þe whiche noblete aboffe
alle bodyes y-medlyde ys y-founden in Mannys spiryt. But for þat þe
qualites, þat with þo bodyes of Elementes comyth in to Medlynge—& yt ys
vnpossible to departe þo qualites from bodyes—ben foure: hot, colde,
moyst, & drye, & complexiouns ben by ham, yt ys necessarie to fynden in
bodyes þat ben medlyde, foure complexiouns; Complexioun ys noþynge ellys
but a manere qualite medlyde in worchynge, & suffrynge of contrariose
qualites þat buþ founden in Elementis, so þat þe leste partye of eche
elemente entre in to þe leste partye of þe oþere partye. And for þat
þilke foure complexiouns: hot, colde,


      

moiste & drye, sumtyme ben y-componyd, þat ys to sugge medlyde, þere
comen of hem VIII, as hote & drye, hote & moist, colde & drye, colde &
moiste; ffoure of þese ben symple, & foure ben componyd. And for þilke
VIII sumtyme ben with mater, sumtyme withoute mater, þere ben XVI; & for
þilke XVI, after sum consideracioun mowe ben naturell to sum Man,  & to sum man vn naturell, þere mowe ben XXXII. Nevere þe lattere
amonge alle þe complexiouns þat man may fynden, þat is componyd of
dyuerse qualites, þere nys non so temperat as ys mannes complexioun;
havynge rewarde to mannes complexioun, alle oþere þynge ys clepyde
colde, hote, moyste, oþere drye. Whanne þat a mete, oþere a medycine,
hath y-suffryde kendlye hete þat ys in Man, & hetyth hym noȝt & colyth
hym nauȝt, ne dryeþ hym noȝt, ne moysted hym noȝt, so þat mannes
complexioun may noȝt conseyven wheþer yt colde hym, ore hete, dryȝe,
oþere moyste, yt is clepyde temperat; & þilke thynge we sigge is hot in
þe firste degre, þat ys y-hatte of kendlye hete, þat ys in oure bodyes &
hetyth oure bodyes withouten grevaunce, & þilke we siggen be hote in þe
secunde degre, whiche þat ys y-hette of oure kendlye hete, so hetyth
oure body, þat he ne myȝte hete vs namore withouten greuaunce; hot in þe
þridde degre:


      

þilke we sigge to be hot in þe þridde degre, whiche þat ys y-hatte of
kendlye hete, bryngeþ to oure bodye sencyble greuaunce; hot in þe fourþ
degre: and þilke in þe fourþ gre þat is y-hat of kendly hete, dystroyeþ
þe body opynlyche; & in þis same manere ȝe may knowe degrees þat ben
colde, & y may preve in þis manere þat yt is necessarye a surgyne to
knowe complexiouns of bodyes, lymes, & of medycynes.  Take two men þat
ben off one age, & lete hem ben y-woundyde with a swerd oþere a knyffe
twarte offere þe arme, in one oure & in  one place. One of þo
men ys of an hote complexioun & a moyste, þe oþere of a colde & a drye;
þe comyne siggynge of lewyde men ys, þat þey scholde boþe by helyde
aftere o manere. But resonable surgye wel y-proved, techith vs þat þey
ne schulle noȝt boþe ben y-helyde aftere on manere; for he þat haþ an
hot complexioun & a moyst, may lyȝtliche haue an hote enposteme, þat ys
an hote swellynge, & þat may be cause of an  hote
ffevyre. What schaltou þanne do? Þou moste loke wheþer he haue y-bled
myche blod at hys wounde, & þenne it ys wel, ellys lete hym blod of þe
contraryose arme, oþere ellys on þe fot on þe same syde; ȝif strengþe &
age acorde, oþere ventuse hym on þe tweye buttokkys; gif þat he be
feble, ȝif he may noȝt go to sege onys a day, helpe hym þereto


      

oþere wit clysterye, oþere with suppositorye; & brynge þou þe partyes of
þe wounde to-gedire, oþere with sowynge, oþere wiþ plumaciolus—þat beþ
smale pelewys—oþere with byndynge, ȝif þat sowynge be noȝt necessarie.
And þenne worche aboute þe wounde, as it ys tolde aftere in þe boke; but
aboue þe wounde leye a Medycine defensiue, of bol Armonyac, oyle of
rosys, & a litel vynegre, so þat þe medycine touche þe sydes of þe
woundes, þat humours mowe noȝt hauen here cours to renne to þe wounde.
And we forbyde hym wyn, Milke, & eyren, & fysch, þat engendrith myche
blod; but he schal ete for his Mete gruell y-made of ote Mele, oþere
barly mele with Almaundes, & generaliche he schal vsen a streyt  doynge, tyl þou be sykere þat he schal haue non enposteme. And ȝif
þat we cunne dyffenden hym from a ffevyre & aposteme, þe science of hys
complexioun techyth vs þat he may of hys seknesse sone be hol.  Þe
oþere of þe colde complexioun ne schal noȝt be leten blod ne ventusyde,
ffor blod scholde be kepte in hem as for tresoure; forbyde hym neiþere
wyn ne flesch; for þe stomak þat ys so feble, ne myȝte nouȝt engendre
necessarie mater of blod þat longyth to þe wounde; ne we dredyth noȝt in
hym þe ffevyre, for his complexioun ys noȝt able to resceyuen þe
ffevyre. We mowe


      

fynden a Medycine made in o manere þat wirchith dyuerse effectis, & he
be y-leyde to dyuerse complexiouns. Grene vytreole, & he be done to a
Man of dryȝe complexioun, engendrith flessch; & ȝif þou leggen hym on a
moyste complexioun, he greuyth noȝt onlyche, but coroduþ yt. And naþeles
vitreole haþ but one manere wyrchinge, þouȝ he wirche dyuerslyche in
dyuerse complexiouns, ryȝte as þe wirchynge of þe sonne ys dyuerse—noȝt
for þe sonne, but for þe wyrchynge of dyuerse bodyes in whom he
wyrchyth. Vitreole dryeþ wonderlyche muche, & in dryȝe bodyes he fyndeþ
þe smale lymes myghty to ageyne stonden hys strengþe. Wherefore he may
nought but drye þe superffluites þat he fynte in þe  wounde; & whenne þo ben y-
dreyede, kynde engendryth fflesch. In moyste bodyes, ffor þat þe smale
lymes beþ feble, & mowe noȝt withstande þe strengthe off þe vytreole, þe
flesch meltyth vndire yt, & so be þe vitreole þe flesch rotyth; & þat
þat ys seyde of dyuerse complexiouns, ys y-seyde of dyverse lymes.
Galyen: ȝif þat tweye woundes  ben evyne i quyter, & þe on be
in a dryȝe lyme, & þe oþere in a moyste lyme, þat þat is in þe dryore
lyme nediþ þe dryore medycine. And ȝif þat two lymes ben y-wounded þat
ben lyche in


      

complexioun, & þat on haþ myche quyter and þe oþere lyte, he þat haþ
myche quyter nedyth to haven þe dryere medycine. Iohannes damacenus:
Medycines & enplastres scholde ben acordynge to þe lymes þat þey ben y-
leyde on. Galienus: a kendlye thynge schal be kepte with þynge þat ys
kendlye þere to; and þat þat is aȝeyne kynde schal be done away with
þynge þat is contrarye þere to. Ȝif þat a surgien knowith noȝt
complexiouns of lymes & of bodyes, he schal noȝt kunne to chaungen hys
medycines aftere þat kynde askeþ. A surgien moste knowe generacioun of
humours, ȝif he wolde knowen þe sciense & þe helynge of Apostemys, as yt
schal ben declared in þe tretys of apostemes; he moste knowyn þe
dyuersite, & þe profytes, & þe offices of lymes, þat he mowe knowen what
lymes han grete wyrchynge in mannys body, & whiche ben of grete felynge,
& whiche mowe bere a stronge Medycine; & þe vertues of lymes he moste
knowe, þat he se whanne þat þe worchynge of enye vertue fayleþ in enye
lyme, þat he mowe helpe þe vertue in þe same lyme faylinge. And ȝif he
haue þe science of knowynge of vertues, þe sciense of spiritus ne schull
noȝt ben y-hud from hym. Alle þese þynges before seyde beþ natureles, &
þey beþ techynge of medycine speculatyff. Also he moste han knowynge of
thynges þat beþ noȝt natureles, þat he kunne chesen gode eyre to hym þat
is y-woundyde,


      

oþere ellys haþ a bocche. Woundes mowe noȝt ben y-dryȝed in a  moyste eyre & a vaporose, but þey þat ben y-woundyde most bene y-
chaungyde from þat moyste eyre to a swote cler eyre & a dryȝe. In
wyntere he moste kepe hym from colde, ffor noþinge grevyth so myche
bonys & synwes þat buþ y-woundyde as colde. And in somere he moste han a
temperable eyre; hit ys necessarye þat he kunne dyoten hys pacient, as y
schal tellen in þe same Chapytell of dyotynge. Also he moste ordeyne
moffynge & reste, as yt nedeþ to þe same syke man; ffor ȝif þat he be
woundyde in þe hed, oþere haue eny puncture off enye synwe, it ys
necessarye þat he reste: dwelle he in styllenesse, & haue an euene bed &
a softe, leste he suffren enye trauaylle of hys lemys; but ȝif þat olde
woundes, wiþouten akynge, weren in hys Armes, hit were gode to hym þat
ys seke to walken on hys fete, & bere hys arme y-bounden to hys nekke; &
ȝif þat þe wounde be in hys schynys & in hys ffete, hit were gode þat he
leyȝe & trauellyde with hys handes. Also a surgien, in alle þat he
myghte, he moste atempre a syke Mannes slepynge, ffor to myche slepynge
engendreþ superffluyte, & feblyth his vertues, & coldyth & losyth alle
hys bodye; to myche wakynge dyssolfiþ & consumeþ hys spirites, & makyth
scharpe hys humores,


      

& hit bryngeþ vnkyndly drowþe to woundes, & ys cause of akynge; also he
moste kunne evacuen hym þat ys ful of euele humores, & fulfylle hym þat
ys wastyde, þat he brynge seke men to gode temperaunce; ellys a wounde
may noȝt ben helyd; entempre he þe hert of hym þat ys seke, ffor to gret
wratthe makyþ þe spirites renne to myche to þe wounde, & þat ys cause of
swellynge;  to grete drede, oþere vntryst of helpe of hys
wounde holdiþ spyrites withynne hys body, þat mater may nouȝt come to
hele þe wounde. Þese sixe thynges ben y-clepyde vnnaturell, whiche
techith a Man speculatyff of leche craft. He mot knowen þe seknesse, as
olde wounde, festre, cancre, & alle oþere sores, þat he traveylle noȝt
in deveyne, & brynge þe seke man to hys deþ: ffor eche dyverse sore
nedith dyverse helpynges. He mote knowe þe cause of þe wounde; ffor a
wounde þat is mad with a swerd oþere a knyff mote oþere weys ben helyde
þen he þat is y-makyde with ston, oþere with fallynge, & a wounde þat is
byten with an hounde schal oþere weys ben helyde þen he þat ys y-byten
with a wod hound, as þou schalt fynde tolde in þe boke hereaftere. And
he mot knowe þe Accidentes þat buþ aboute a wounde, ffor the wounde
schal nevere hele tyl þe Accidentes ben remevyde awey. Accidentis ys a
þynge þat falliþ to þe wounde out


      

of kynde, as hete, colde, drowþe oþere to gret moistnesse, crampe, &
oþere þynges aȝeyne kynde. A surgien mot ordeyne dyetynge in dyverse
manere, as it is tolde in þe Chapitell of dyetynge. Whenne þat it is
nedful, he mote ȝyve dyverse drynkes. Galien: laxativis & vomytes buþ
necessarie to hem þat han olde, rotyde, stynkynde woundes; ffor whanne
þat þe body is purgyde from evyle humours, þe wykkednesse of þe matere
renneþ from þe wounde, & so þe wounde is sonnere y-helyde. He þat
byholdeþ alle þe partyes of a medycine, he may wel se  that
it is necessarie a surgyne to knowen ffysyk and oþere dyverse science,
as hit is tolde tofore in þis boke.

 The þridde Chapitele of þe furste techynge is of Intencioun off a Surgyne.

Alle þe entencioun of surgerye, how dyverse þat it be, yt is on of þre
maneres: þe ffurste ys undoynge þat þat is hol; secunde ys helpynge of
þat þat is tobroke; þe þridde ys remevynge of þat þat is to myche, so
þat it be do with hande crafte; ffor alle þe entencioun of a surgien ys
vndire one of þis þre entensiouns, oþere ellys vndire one of hem. A
surgyne vndoþ þat þat ys hol, whanne he letyth blod ore garsyth oþere
brenneþ, oþere setteþ on waterlechys,


      

ffor þis ys a surgyns craft, þawȝ we for oure pride have y-lefte yt to
laborers & to wommen, for Galien & Rasys dyden it wiþ here handes as
here bokys tellyþ. And we vndoþ þat þat is hol, whenne þat we kutteþ þe
veynes þat ben in þe templys & þe forhed, & makyth cauterisaciones from
þe seknesse of þe eyȝen, & whenne þat we maken Cauteries in þe hed & in
dyverse places of þe body as y schal telle in þe chapitell of
Cauterysynge. Þe secunde entencioun ys to hele þat þat is tobroke as:
woundes, olde woundes, ffestres, Cancres, and in bringynge to here place
Ioyntes þat bene oute, & in helynge bonys þat ben tobroken. Þe þridde
entencioun is to remevyn þat þat ys to myche as scurffyls of þe hed & þe
nekke, & oþere partyes of þe body, & Cataractis þat ys a water þat
comyth bytwene þe whyte of þe eyȝe & þe Appul. Sebel þat beþ veynes þat
buþ in þe whyte of þe eyȝe, & beþ ful of blod. Vngula,  þat
ys a thynge þat bygynneþ by þe nese & goth overe þe eyȝe, tyl he keffere
alle þe eyȝe & knottes þat ben in þe eyȝe, & oþere seknesse of þe eyȝe,
& in doynge awey polippes þat is flesch þat growiþ with ynne þe nese,
wertys & wennys, fficus þat is a superffluyte þat growiþ vp on þe skyn
off þe pyntellys hed withouten, emeraudes & a schyn


      

þat enclosyth a wommans prive membre, þe sixte fynger of þe hand, and
manye superfluytes þat beth nought semlye to mannys body.

 The ffurste Chapitell of þe secunde tretys ys an universel word off
smale lymes, & here helpynges of generacioun of enbrion þat is child in
þe moder wombe.

Galien seith þat it ys necessarie a Surgien to knowe Anotomye, ne leffe
henoȝt þat iche brode ligament þat ys a schyn, & iche rounde ligament to
ben a synwe, & so be hys opynioun he myȝte fallen in erroure. Þerefore i
þynke to ordeyne a Chapitell of þe kynde & of þe fforme & þe helpynge of
alle smale lymes. Avycene seith, knowlechynge of a þynge þat haþ cause
may noȝt be knowe but by hys cause, þerefore we mote knowe þe cause
membrorum consimilium: þat ys to sigge smale lymes. Y wyl telle þe
generacioun of embrion, þat ys to sigge, how a childe ys bygete in þe
modire wombe. Galien and Avycene tellen þat of boþe þe spermes of Man &
womman—wirchynge & sofferynge togedires, so þat iche of hem wirche in
oþere & suffren in oþere—embrion ys bygete. But þe worchynge of Mannes
kynde is more myȝtyere, & wommans  kynde


      

ys more ffeblere. Ffor ryȝt as þe rendelys of chese haþ hym by weye of
worchynge, & þe Mylk be weye off suffrynge, so to þe generacioun of
embrion, Mannes sperme  hath hym be weye of worchynge, &
wommans sperme  be weye of suffrynge, & ryȝt as þe rendles
& þe mylk makyth a  chese, so boþe þe spermes  of man & womman makyþ þe generacioun of embrion. Þowȝ þat alle
þe smale lymes of a childe be y-geten of boþe two spermes,  naþeles to cloþe hem with fflesch & with fatnesse comeþ to hem
menstrewe blod. Þe marys of a womman haþ an able complexioun to
conseyven, & of here kynde sche castyth þe spermes to þe deppeste place
off here, and of here nature sche closyth hire mouth þat þere myȝte
nouȝt entre þe poynt of an nedle. And þenne þe formal virtue whiche þat
almyghty god haþ ȝeuen to the marys, ordeyneþ & deffndeþ every party
of þese spermes in here kynde, tyl þat þe childe ben ybore. Understande
þat þe flesch & þe fatnesse ys y-mad of menstrewe blod, the bonys & þe
grustlys, ligamentes, synwes, cordes, Arteries, veynes, pannycles, þat
buþ smale cloþes & þe schyn buþ engendred of boþe þe spermes, as Avicene
& oþere Autores tellyn. Ȝif þat enye of þe lymes þat buþ engendrede off
the spermes be don away, he may nevere verrelyche ben restoride, ffor
þe matere of


      

hym ys þe sperme of þe fadire & þe modere. But þe flesch whose matere ys
blod þat is al day engendred in vs may wel & verreliche be restoryde.
Þese smale lymes han dyverse formes, complexioun, & helpynges after the
dyversite of þe proportiouns of þe mater whiche þat þey ben 
mad of; ffor þowȝ þat alle the lymes be mad of on matere y-medlyde,
naþeles in eche of þe smale lymes þere is a dyverse proposicioun  of matere, for the whiche matere þey taken dyverse forme
& dyverse helpe. Almyghty god gevyth to effrye þynge of hys forme after
þat hys matere proporcioned deservyt.

Þe bon is furst of consimile membris þat is on off smale lymes, þe
whiche ys colde & drye, & he haþ dyverse formes in mannes bodye, for he
helpiþ dyversliche; þe cause why þere ben many dyverse bonys in mannys
body is,  ffor sum tyme it ys nede to meffyn o lyme
without an oþere, & þat were inpossible, ȝif in alle þe body were but on
hol bon. An oþere cause is why þere ys many bonys; for sum diffenden þe
principal lymes from harme, as þe brayn scolle þe brayn of þe hed; somme
ben ffundamentys, as þe bonys of þe rugge, & of þe schynes, & of þe
Armes. Some ben as armure, as additamentys, þat ben in þe syde of þe
rugge bon, & somme fulfylle þe holwenesse of somme Iunttes, as þe handys
& þe


      

fete, & somme þere ben þat þe roundnesse of on bon myȝte entre in to þe
holwenesse of þe oþere bon & naþeles scholde noȝt lakken hys meffynge,
as þe schulder bonys, & the hepe bonys. Þou maiste fynde hou many bonys
þere ben in þe secunde tretys where schal be tolde plenerliche—þe
Anotamye of consimile membrys of alle  þe body, from þe hed
to þe fot. A grustyll ys cold & drye, & is nesschere þenne a bon, &
hardere þanne þe flesch, & in þe flesch hath vi helpynges.  Helpynge þe
grustel. The ffurste þat þere scholde be a Mene, bytwene þe vtter ende
of þe hard bon, & þe nessch flesch.  Þe secunde, þat þe harde scholde
noȝt hurt þe nessche, namlyche, in þe tyme of comprission, & in þe tyme
of smytynge.  The þridde, þat þe ende of þe bonys, whiche þat ben in þe
Iunttes scholde han a softere confricatioun in here Iunttes.  Þe iiij,
þat he scholde fulfille þe office of þe bon, to susteyne a brawne
meffynge, a membre þat haþ non bon, as þe overe lyd of þe eyȝe.  Þe v.
for his necessarie a grustyll to be  in a place þat ys
noȝt ful hard, as þe þrote bolle; ffor þe ende of þe þrote bolle ys
grustlye.  Þe vi. for it is necessarie some lymes to han a
sustentacioun & a plicacioun, þat is a foldynge, to be streynde & drawen
abrod, as þe nese þrylles & þe grustle of þe ere.


      

Ligamente is colde & drye, & goþ out of þe bonys, & haþ þe forme of a
ȝenewe, & he may be bowyde, but he feliþ noȝt, & he haþ iiij helpynges.
Þe fyrste ys þat he knytte on bon with an oþere. It is necessarie þat o
bon be knytte with an oþere, þat manye bonys myȝte make on body as on
bon, & nevere þe later eche membre myȝte meffyn by hym-selfe, & þere
fore þe ligamente was bowable & insensible; for ȝif þat yt had y-be
sensible, þey myȝte nouȝt have susteynde the travaylle & þe meffynge of
þe Iunttys; and ȝif þat he hadde be inflexible as a bon, of whom þat he
comyþ of,  on lyme myȝte noȝt han meffyde withouten an oþere.
Þe secunde help ys, þat he ys joynede with ȝenewys to make cordys &
brawne. Þe þridde helpynge ys, þat he scholde ben a restynge place to
summe senewys. Þe fourþe, þat be hym þe membris þat ben withynne þe body
scholde ben tyede, whiche þat nedyþ hongynge.

A corde ys colde & drye, & he comyth from þe brayn oþere fro þe nuca,
þat ys þe marye of þe rugge bonys.  From þe brayn comeþ vij peire
cordys, & þey buþ y-clepyde sensible ȝenewys, from þe nuca þere comyth
xxx peire cordys, and on by hym selffen & þey buþ mevable; & alle þe
cordys þat comyth of þe brayn, & þe nuca


      

habbeþ boþe felynge & meffynge. & þe cordys ben whyte, bowable, stronge,
& towȝ; & of here kynde þey brynge meffynge & felynge to lymes. & for
þat hit is longe to devydeþ alle þe partyes of ȝenewes; in þe secunde
tretys y schal ordeyne Anotamye of ȝenewes & here place, as þey ligge;
in þe whiche place þou moste be ware, whenne þou schalt kutte oþere
brenne, whenne þat we schulle ordeyne Anotamye of official membris & of
here woundes. Official membre ys to sigge: a ffynger, a Ioynt, an hand,
oþere a fote ore oþire lymes of ofyce.

Arteries beþ hote, noȝt for here owne kynde, but for þe hote blod & lyf
þat goþ in ham from þe herte. Of here kynde þey ben colde & drye, & þey
han tweye cloþes, outsepte on þat goth to þe longes. Þe innore cote
 is grettere & strengere, þat he mowe withholde a Mevable
matere & an hote. & here bygynnynge is of þe lyfte syde of þe herte. &
þere bygynneþ tweye Arteries, on goþ to þe longe & haþ bot on cote &
sprat in þe same longe, & þere endyth & bryngeþ blod to þe longe, by
whom he ys y-norysschyde, & spirit of lyf, & þat he myȝte brynge from þe
longe eire  to þe herte, for to entempren þe fumose hete of
þe same herte. & þis Arterie ys clepyde


      

venalis, & yt is a manere veyne, ffor as myche as he may haue but o
cote, & þerefore he is þe more obedient to be drawen abrod þorwe out
alle þe longes & also þat þe blod þat norysschith þe longe myȝte
liȝtlokere swete out of þis arterie. Þe oþere Artery, þat comyth out of
þe lefte syde of þe herte, haþ two cotys, because þat on myȝt noȝt
ageyne stonde þe strengþe of þe spirites, and also þat þat is wiþynne þe
Arterye is ful derwarde & nediþ gret kepynge. Þere ben þre helpynges of
þe Arteries: on is þat colde eyre by hem myȝte be drawe & y-brouȝt to þe
herte, whenne þe arterye is drawe abrod; þe secunde ys pat þe fumosite
myȝt be caste out, whenne sche is constreynyde; þe þridde ys þat þe
spirite of lyf myȝte be broȝt by hem to alle þe body. Þese Arteries beþ
devydyde many weyes, whose divisiones Man may noȝt conseyve by hys wyt,
ne þey ne beþ noȝt dredful to surgiens crafte; but whenne þou schalt
drede þe arterye i schal tellen þe in here places.

Veynes by cause of here bodyes beþ y-demyde colde & drye; but for þe
blod þat is withynne hem þey beþ y-demyde hote, & alle þe veynes han
here  bygynnynge of þe lyffere, in þe whiche lyffere two
veynes han pryncipal begynnynge. On veyne bygynneþ of þe holwe syde of
þe lyvere, & ys y-clepyde Porta, þat ys a ȝatte, & here ofyce is to
drawe chilum from þe stomake & þe guttes by mene of þe


      

veynes miscraykus; þilke chylum spredeþ þorwe al þe lyffere by mene of
veynes Capillares. Chilum ys þe licoure of mete & of þe drynke, whenne
yt goþ out of þe stomake & þe guttes. Veynes miserayke beþ smale veynes,
þat comyth out of þe veyne þat is y-clepyde porta, & clevyth on þe
stomake & þe gottys. Veynes capillarys þat beþ veynes, as yt were herys
of a Mannes hed.

 After hem comyth pannyceles, þat ys to sigge, a smal cloth, þat ys mad
of sotyll þredys of synwis veynes & arteries, where fore þey ben colde &
dryȝe & sensible, & þey han þre helpynges. Þe firste is þat they mowe
bynden manye þynges in on forme, as þe pannicle of þe hed bynde vii
bonys; þe secunde Iuvament is þat þey hongen & bynden somme membrys with
oþere, as þe reyns to þe rugge & þe marys to þe rugge bon; þe þrydde
helpynge ys þat some membrys þat beþ insensible by here kynde, by þe
pannycles þat wreyeþ hem ffeliþ by accydent, as þe longes, þe lyffere, &
þe splene, & þe reynes; þese lymes by here kynde haþ non felynge, but
what þat þey felyn it ys by Accident of þe pannycle þat wreyeþ hem.

Þe flesch is noȝt hot, but yt is moist, & haþ þre manere lyknesse; on ys
symple flesch, & hys helpynge ys to fulfylle þe voyde placys


      

of smale lymes, to bryngen hem to a gode schappe, & þat iche harde lyme
 ne scholde nouȝt hurten oþere with confricacioun togedire.
An oþere manere flesch ys þat is glandelose, þat ys as hyt were
achcharnes, & hys Iuvamente is þat he turnyth vmydites to here hete: as
þe glandelose flesch of wommans brestys, whyche þat turnyth þe blod þat
ys drawe from þe marys into þe mylk, þe glandelose flesch of þe
ballokes, þat turnyth þe blod into sperme, & þe glandelose flesch off
the chekys þat engendreþ spotel. Þe þridde manere of flesch ys a flesch
þat is in brawnys, þat ys y-clepede a brawny flesch, ffor he ys medlyde
wiþ sotyl þredys of cordys, as y schal tellyn aftere, whose helpynge
schal be tolde in þe Anotamye of þe brawne.

At þe laste is þe schyn, þat is temperat in al here qualite, & is y-mad
of smale þredys of veynes, synwes, & Arteries, þat makeþ hym sensible,
and geveþ hym lyf and norisschynge, þat he be governoure of alle þe
body. & þe skyn ys y-mad temperat, for he scholde knowe hot, colde,
moyste & drye, softe & hard, scharpe & smeþe; & ȝif þe skyn were as
sensible as a ȝenewe, a man myȝte noȝt dwellen in colde eyre, ne in hote
eyre; ne þe skyn of þe fyngres endys, whiche þat ys more temperat þenne
eny oþere skyn of þe body, ne scholde


      

noȝt ben a gode demere in knowynge hot, cold, hard oþere scharpe, softe
oþere nessche.

 Brawnys þowȝ þey ben mad of matere y-medlyde, nevere þe latere þey beþ
y-reknyde amonge membrys consimiles, for þey comen to þe makynge off
Membrys-officiales. Brawne ys y-mad of fflesch,  ȝenewe, &
ligamente, & þey ben Instrument off voluntarie mevynge. Þe ȝenewe þat
comyth from þe brayn & þe nuca, & goþ forþ to meve the lymes, ys y-
medlyde with a ligamente, & whenne þe ȝenewe & þe ligamente beþ medlyde
togedyre, yt ys clepyde a corde, & the corde ys y-made for þre skylles:
þe ffurste for a symple senewe ys to sensible, & þe ȝenewe by hym-self
ne myȝte noȝt suffren to grete travaylle & mevynge, but þe felawschipe
of þe ligamente, þat ys insensible, lutliþ þe felynge of þe synwe, and
bryngeþ hym to a profitable temperaunce. Þe ȝenewe hadde tweyne oþere
defautes: nesschenesse & litylnesse, but þo tweyne defautes, þe medlynge
of þe ligament ffulfilleþ; for the neschenesse ys entempred & y-
strengthyde, and þe lytelnesse ys y-made more. The nesschenesse comyth
of þe brayn, ffor it ys nessche; and þe lytelnesse comeþ of þe Nuca, for
it ys lytel. Þat þat is mad of þis nerff & þis ligamente ys clepyde a
corde, whiche þat meviþ þe lymes to wyl of þe soule,


      

whenne þat it is schortid oþere y-drawe, aftere þat þe lyme bowyth to
þis corde. ffor þere ys Asosyed a symple fflesch forto maken a brawne
for þre proffytes: þe furste profyt, þat boþe in drawynge & wiþdrawynge
of þe corde, the flesch scholde be as a pylwe, vp on whom he myȝte
reste; þe secunde cause, þat þe flesch þat is nessche & moyst schulde
kepen þe corde, þat  sche dreyȝede noȝt in here mevynge; þe
þridde, þat þe makynge of lymes were þe more schap-lokore. Þe brawne is
made bowynge, as a bowe þat ys y-bent; & for þat kynde wolde kepe þys
compositioun, he clothyde þe brawne wyþ a pannycle. Þe corde whenne he
entrith in to þat brawne, ys departyde in to many smale þredys, & þey
ben clepyde vylles, þat ys to sugge, wrabbynges. & þese villes bene of
þre maners, in lengþe—by whom vertue þat draweþ haþ myȝt, in brede—by
whom vertu þat castyth out haþ myȝt, in twart ofere—by whom vertu þat
wiþhalt haþ myȝt; & at þe ende of þe brawne þilke þredys beþ gadride to
gedre to maken a corde, after þat it is necessarie, many cordys oþere
brawnys to ben engendride. & official membrys ben y-mad of þese
consimile membrys, whiche þat beþ instrument to resonable sowle. And in
þe secunde tretys y wyl tellen þe anotamye of lymes of ofice.


      

The ffurste Chapitle of þe þridde techynge is of difference of woundes &
olde woundes & off generall cures.

 We schulle vndirstonde þat wounde, olde wounde, ffestre, cancre y-
wondyde, a bon out of loynt, a bon tobroken, Aposteme, alle þese ben y-
clepyde vndoynge of þat þat ys hol, & alle þese seknesse & manye oþere
as wel mowe fallen to consimile membrys. as to oficial membris. Vulnus
is a newe wounde. Vlcus ys an olde rotyde wounde. I schall 
tellen in here place þe dyfference of festre & cancre & apostemys. Plage
comynliche ys y-taken of an olde wonde; and ofte tyme we fynden, þat an
olde wounde ys y-clepyde Vulnus, as Ipocres seiþ: Vulnera Annua necesse
est in eis os tabefieri & cicatrices concavas fieri.  That is to sugge,
it ys ned, þat þe bon in an olde wounde to be rotyd, & þe Cicatrices to
be holwe. Cicatrice ys þe place of þe skyn above the wounde, whenne þat
yt is hol. Some wounde buþ symple & some ben componyde. In tweye manere
he ys clepyde a symple wounde. On manere, for he haþ noȝt leste of
flesch; an oþere maner, for he haþ non oþere seknesse with hym, ne is
noȝt distempride. A wounde componed ys y-clepyde contrarye to hym þat is
symple. But boþe symple & also componyd


      

some tyme is in þe flesch oþere in þe synwe oþer in bon, oþere in veyne,
oþere in arterie. Also þese wondes han dyverse causes. Some comen from
wiþynne of þe malice, oþere of to gret multytude of humores; forto gret
multitude of humores oþere while tobrekyth þe membre, þat wiþholdiþ &
woundiþ hym cold matere streyneþ, drye matere kutteþ, moistnesse
withouten matere makeþ no wounde, but selden with matere, but he drawiþ
þe lyme to brode. And also þe cause wiþout may be dyverse, oþerwhyle
with a swerd, ore with a þynge þat kutteþ alonge, oþerwhile with a
knyff, oþere a spere, oþere an arwe þat  prykeþ, & somme ben
made wiþ a stafe, oþere with a ston, oþere with fallynge, & somme ben
mad with bytinge of an hound, oþere of a wod hounde; & alle þese ben
dyverse, after þe dyverste of here cause; & also þe manere of helynge ys
dyverse. Alle þe entensioun of helynge of woundes, ys forto sowdyn & to
helyn, & to restoren þat þat is departyde, whiche þat may noȝt overe al
be don. Ffor ȝif þat membres of offyce ben kutte of, þey mowe nevere ben
restoryd; ne non of þe consimile membres may be restoryde, & he be don
awey: as bonys, pellicules, grustles, ligamentis & schyn. Ffor þe cause
of here generacioun is þe sperme of þe ffadire & þe modere, as y tolde
tofore; but in place of thynge þat is lore, kynde restoryth þat þat is
most convenient to þat place; but the flesch may be restoryd, by cause
þat þe blod ys engendred


      

al day in vs, & þe blod ys þe matere of flesch; & somme suggen þat
veynes, synwes, & arteries myȝte nouȝt be restoryde as þey were tofore;
but þey mowe be restoryd as bonys buþ. But Galien & Avycene, & I þat am
expert here suggynge, suggen þat þey mowe be restoryde with verrey
consolidacioun, whanne þat here kuttynge ys lytell, & whenne þat þe
synwys þat buþ newe kutte beþ so wyde aȝeyne; but þey mowe noȝt be
consouded, whanne þat here kuttynge ys gret & myche; & resoun grauntyth
yt. Synwys by kynde buþ nessche and viscose; & þerefore þey mowe ben
consouded. Þe veynes & þe arteries mowe be consouded by resoun of þe
blod þat ys in hem. I þynke to ordeynen eche Chapitell  be
hym selven, aftere þe dyversite of lymes & of placys, whyche þat þey buþ
y-made yn; & y wyl begynne at a symple wounde y-mad in flesch.

 þe secunde Chapitell off þe thridde techynge off the ffurst tretis is
of cure of a wounde y-mad in fflesch.

Now we willen treten of a wounde y-makyd in fflesch. We wylle begynne at
a symple wounde, y-mad wiþ knyff oþere wiþ swerd ore spere, oþere with
arwe, oþere with enye oþere thynge


      

semblable to hem. Bynde togedyre þilke wounde with a band þat close þe
wounde to gedire, & kepe þe wounde from swellynge, with þe whyte of an
eyȝe y-leyde aboue þe wounde, & lete þat wounde ben in reste, & þere
nedyth none oþere cure, namlye, whanne þe wounde ys withouten akynge;
but and þere be in wounde gret akynge, þanne þere is a tokne þat þere ys
a synwe prikyde vndire þe wounde, oþere a pannicle þat ys betwene þe
flesch & þe bon, & þanne þere ys al an oþere cure, as y schal telle in
þe chapitell of the puncture of a synwe. And y haue helyd a man þat was
sefenty ȝere olde, þat was y-smyten wiþ a spere þorwe þe flesch of þe
buttoke by þe lengþe of a fote & more, but þilke wonde touchyde non
synwe; & þat y wiste sykerliche, for he had non akynge; y helde the
wounde opyn al a day, with a lyte smal tente & a schert þat y myȝte
wyte, ȝif þat he scholde ake on þe morwe & I comaundyde hym to reste,
and on þe morwe y fonde non inflacion ne akynge, & þenne y caste aweye
þe tente & lete þe wounde closen, & so y comaundide hym to reste, &
wiþynne þe þridde day he was al hol. And ȝif þat a wounde were mad wiþ a
swerd, oþere wiþ eny þynge þat  kutteþ in lengþe, a man most
loke ȝif þe wounde be so litel þat he nede non sowynge, & þenne brynge
þe parties of þe wounde togedyre, þat it may wel ben y-joynede, & leye
above þe wounde a poudere y-mad of on partye of ffranke-Ensence,


      

& of two partyes of sancdragoun & of þre parties of quykelyme, & lete
noȝt þe poudre entre wiþynne þe wounde but above, for þere schal noþynge
entre withynne þe wounde, & kepe þe parties of þe wounde þat buþ brouȝt

þis manere


on be þe sydes of þe wounde, so þat boþe þilke plumacioles holde þe
wounde þus y-closyde

& joynde togedire, as yt was joyned ere þenne yt was ykutte; & bynde þe
wounde togedire abouen þe plumacioles, with a rolle þat goth twartoffere
after þis lettere XX, & take a lynnen cloth & wete hym in two parties of
whyte of an eyȝe, & in on partie of oyle of roses i-bete togedire,
vndire þe plumacioles abofe þe wounde, þat ys y-browȝt togedyre, forto
kepe þe poudre, & do noȝt awey þe medycine tyl foure dayes ben ago, but
ȝif þat þe wounde ake, oþere ellys be to-swollyn; & þenne bynde þe wonde
as yt was toforne, with þe whyte of þe eyȝe, oyle, poudre, &
plumacioles. But ȝif þe wounde were so myche, þat þe byndynge wolde noȝt
suffice, oþere were kutte twart offere þe lyme, so þat þe partyes of þe
lyme myȝt noȝt wel be browȝt togedire, þanne sowe þe wounde on þis
manere: joyne þe lippes of þe wounde togedire, & ware þat non oyle ne
dust, ne noþynge ellys þat lattyd consolidacioun, falle bytwene


      

þe lippes of þe wounde, & haue an nedle  þre kornerde, whose
eyȝe scholde be holyde on boþe sydes, so þat þe  þrede þat is in þe nedle may ligge in þe holwe place, & þilke
schal be twynede, & withoute knotte & ywaxide, & þe lippes of þe wounde
schulle ben sowyde togedyre, & þe þrede schal be knette with two knottes
in þe firste place; in þe secunde place with on knotte, & so make as
manye punctis as yt is necessarie, & eche puncte schal be from oþere by
þe brede of a lytel ffyngere, & streyne þe wounde wiþ knettynge, & þe
sowynge of þe lippes of þe wounde togedire þat he ake sumwhat, but noȝt
to myche, & ȝif þat þere nede mo punctis to be þere þen two, efire more
þere schal be odde punctys, as þre, fyfe, oþere seuene; & þe on puncte
schal be fyrst from þe on ende of þe wonde by þe  brede of a litel fyngire, & þe oþere puncte schal be at þe oþere
ende of þe wounde, & þe þridde puncte schal be in þe myddul of þe
wounde; & ȝif it be nede to haue mo punctis, þou schalt begynnen at þe
myddel puncte, & make as manye punctes on boþe þe sydes, as yt ys nede,
tyl þou come to boþe endys; ffor by þis manere of sowynge neiþere partye
schal be crokyde, & so þe place may fairere ben restoryde. And eueremore
take hede, ȝif þe wounde be noȝt depe, þy sowynge schal be nouȝt depe.
And ȝif þy wounde be depe þy sowynge schal be depe, þat alle þe parties
of þe wounde mowe


      

be joyned togedire. Ffor ȝif þe wounde were depe, & þy sowynge were noȝt
depe, nedys þere moste ben in þe depþe of þe wounde a gret holwenesse,
to þe whiche holwenesse blod & quyter scholde be cast; & þilke quyter &
blod scholde lette þe  helynge of þe wounde. And þe poudre
þat ys seyde in þe same chapytell schal be leyde aboue þe same sowynge,
& þou schalt kepen þe sowynge & þe parties of þe wounde, þat buþ brouȝt
togedyre, with plumacioles þre cornelyd & with alle oþere þynges þat beþ
in þis chapytel forseyde. And ȝif þat a wounde haue be to longe in þe
eyre opyne, whiche þat ys cause of quyter þat latteþ consolidacioun,
þenne we moste clense þe wounde with  þis mundificatyff, þat
is mad of floure, of whete & hony & watyre oþere mel rosate, & colat þat
ys y-clansed from þe roses, & of barly mele. Of þese mundyficatyfes þou
schalt han a ful techynge in þe laste tretys. But ȝif þe wounde be y-
componed, a leche moste han as manye intensiones as þere ben accidentys
to þe wonde. Y sette ensaumple: y suppose þat a wounde be componed with
holwenesse & lesynge of fflesch & of skyn, & þere be myche quyter & al
so þere be a posteme & þere be grete akynge, al this ys clepyde a wounde
componyde. Þanne we schulle noȝt only take hede to consolidacioun of
þilke wounde, þat is to sigge helynge, but firste we


      

schul aswagen akþe & aposteme, as yt schal be tolde in þe chapitle of
aposteme & of akynge; aftirwarde we schullen clanse þe quyter, & aftere
þat regenere fflesch, & at þe laste brynge ouere a Cicatrice. In alle þe
werkynges of medicine, where þat akþe ys, ffirste we schulle aswagen
akynge; ffor abouen alle oþere þynge stronge akynge, ouere comeþ myȝte
of vertu & strengþe, & also resoun tellyth; membrys þat han akþe, þilke
akþe ys cause of drawynge from oþere places to þe membre þat akeþ  þe worste þynge of þe humoures. Avicene seyth humours beþ drawen
to  lymes þat aken for two causes: On cause, for kynde &
Spiritus and humoures rennyth þedyre; þe secunde cause, for akþe feblyth
þe lyme, & humours & spiritis renne to þe feble lymme. Þe swellynge
schal ere ben y-helyde þen þe wounde. Galien & Avycene tellen þat alle
þynge þat consoudeþ þe wounde, grefyþ þe wounde, ȝif þat þere be
aposteme with þe wounde, & þe quyter schal ben y-clansyde, ere þenne þou
legge enye generatyff to holwe woundys. Avicenne tellyth a cause, why
þat yvele flesch growith in a wounde, ȝif þat a leche wolde besy hym
with a medycin regeneratyff to engendre flesch in a wounde, ere þanne þe
quytire were clansede. And whenne þat þe wounde ys clensyde, þenne we
schulle fulfyllen þilke holwnesse with


      

flesch, ere þanne þat wounde ben y-helyde; leste þat þere dwellen an
holwnesse vndire þe wounde whenne þat he ys helyde, in whom þat quyter
scholde be engendryde, þe whiche eche day scholde augmente þilke
holwnesse, & so we moste ben constreynede to opyne an oþere tyme þat,
þat was helyde tofore. Þou mayste fynden aftere in þe chapytell of
woundys of synwes how þou schalt aswagen akþe, and in the sixte
Chapitell of þis techynge þou schalt fynde þe cure of a wounde, þat hath
a swellynge, and ys out of kynde dystempryde, and þou schalt have in þe
chapitle of olde woundys; how thou schalt clense, quytyre, and regendre
flessch 

 Cap. iii. of the þridde techynge of the ffurst tretis is of
helynge of a wounde y-makyde in synwe.

Almiȝtie god hath ȝife to synwe gret felynge, & ȝif þat he be hurt he
suffrede grete akynge. Galien: a synwe that is more felynge þen anoþere
lyme yt is nessessarie þat he have gretter akynge. Vndirstonde þat a
wounde þat is y-makyde in a synwe, may nouȝt ben wiþouten akynge. The
woundes þat beþ y-makyde in synwe, oþer þey ben in lengthe oþere þey beþ
in brede. Þo woundes þat beþ y-mad in lengthe of þe synwe beþ lasse
perylous,


      

& þo þat beþ in brede of þe synwe beþ more perilous. Oþere whyle a synwe
ys y-kut al atwo, & þenne þilke lyme to whom þilke synwe serfede, lesiþ
þe menynge & þe felynge þat þilke synwe brouȝt to hym from þe brayn.
Oþere while þulke synwe is nouȝt y-kut a two, but he is y prikyde, and
þenne it is perel lest þe crampe come for to gret akþe. For akþe entrith
in to þe part of þe synwe þat is y-kut oþer priked, & by þe party of þe
synwe þat is hol akþe is brouȝt to þe brayn, & so crampe may comen to þe
wounde by on of þre weyes, þat is to gret akþe colde oþer rotynge. Of
þese þre oþere ellys of on by hym self, may come a drawynge togedre of a
synwe þat is a cause of a crampe; & þat þat is seyde of wounde of a
symple synwe, oft-tymes may fallyn in a wounde of a corde & a brawn, &
namlyche of a corde þat is in þe bygynninge of a brawn. Þe woundes þat
ben in þese þre consimel membris, þat is to sigge, synwe, corde, &
brawn, habben on drede in course of þe crampe, & also on drede of
lesynge, felynge, & menynge, & þerfor be war in þe cure of a wounde i-
makyde in synwe, wheþer þat þere be a prikynge, oþere þat þe synwe be y-
kut twartofere, oþer ellys be y-kut only by his lengthe. Ȝif only he be
y-prikyde þe wonde of þe skyn is hol, & þenne it is clepyde a blynde
puncture, oþer þe wounde is opene & it is clepide an opene prikynge. In
a blynde


      

prikyne hit is necessarie to opyn þe skyn, & afterwarde held in to þe
hole, as  hot as he may suffren, oyle of roses swote
smyllynge, þat is y-made of oyle de olyffe, þat is nouȝt rype tyl þe
wounde be al ful. & aboue þe wounde leye whyte terbentyne y-drawe abrod
betwene tweye cloutes, & anoynt al þe membris about þe wounde wiþ hote
oyle of rosys, y-made þikke wiþ bol Armonyak, & after þat leye a lynne
cloth y-hat aboue, & after þat a gode quantyte of towȝ y-tosyd, & bynde
þe lyme  softlyche wiþout streyninge; & ȝif þe akþe wiþ þis
medycine wolde nouȝt cese, remeffe & chaunge þis same medycine oft tymes
in þe day & in þe nyȝt, & ȝif þe prikynge be in þe fot, anoynte þe
grynde wiþ hote comyn oyle, & vndire þe Arme holys & in þe nekputte, ȝif
þat þe prikynge be in þe hande. For þys vncture ratefieþ & efenyþ þo
placys by whom akþe goth to þe brayn, & it lattiþ drawynge togedre of þe
synwe, & þowȝ þat þou sest nouȝt akþe, sese in some men, as hastly as
þou woldyst, nevere þe later chaunge nouȝt þy medycine, for þere may be
no bettere medycine. But ȝif þat akþe dure ouere longe yt is nouȝt efel
to putte a lutyl opin to þe oyle of rosys and þe bol armoniak, þat þou
leydest aboute þe wounde. Þe seke man most reste, & by


      

no weye he scholde nouȝt be wroþ, hys bed most be made softe euene &
smeþe þat he myȝte haue rest. Whanne þat þe akþe aswagyth & þe wounde
gyueth sum qyter, þan þe syke man ys saf from al manere peryle, but ȝif
he do enye newe error. Of þis wounde ypocras spekiþ: In vulneribus malis
& fortibus sanie non aparente malum, þat is to seye: in evyle woundys &
stronge woundes, ȝif no quyter apere, hit is yuele. Stronge woundes ben
y-clepyde woundys þat sore aken. Iuel woundes beþ þo, to whom scharpe
humores rennyth & beþ nouȝt obedyent to kyndlie hete to ben turnyde into
quyter & þerefore ypocras seyde, þat whanne þat akynge sesyth & quyter
aperith, yt is a tokne of hele. Þe þridde signe a man moste 
knowe in þis place, þat lewyde men seyne akynge & swellynge in a lyme y-
woundyde, leggen þereto a maner potage y-mad of erbys & swynes grese,
water, & floure of whete, corupyn þe lyme, & þilke corupcioun is cause
of þe crampe; for Galyen seiþ þat a synwe is mad of a moiste matere & a
cold, & he rotyth of hete & moistnesse. Also sum men forto aswage þe
akþe of a synwe þat is y-prikyde, putteþ þe lyme in to hote water, oþer
ellys caste it on þe lyme hot water,  þe whiche
water is most grefes to þe synwe. Galyen: hote water þowȝ it aswage
akþe, to the


      

prikynge of a synwe ys most greuest; colde also gefyth sore þe synwes as
wel in somere as in wyntere. Ypocras in þe ferthe partye of his
Amphorismes: colde is bytinge and grefes to woundys; and also in þe
chapitell nexte folwynge, bot it be in a crampe wiþ out wounde. Galyen
seiþ in þe ende of his comente: colde is most grefest, to a synwe lyme
þat is y-woundyde & ys toswolle, namly, & he haue þe crampe. Hit sewiþ
þenne þat an hote medycine & a drye is most accordynge to synwes þat beþ
y-woundyde; bot nouȝt to hot a medycine, leste þat he make þe lyme
toswellyn; & drye nouȝt wiþ stipticite, lest he close þe pores of þe
schyn. Galyen seiþ: it is yuel to close þe pores of a lyme þat is y-
prikyde. Þe medicyne þenne most ben hote & drye, wiþ subtilite as
terbentyne to moiste bodyes; & to drye bodyes, he most be medlyde wiþ a
lytel eufforbium. Asa fetida is best medycine, ȝif þou make of hym
emplaster, serapinum, & þe feces of wax, & þe fylthes of vesselis of
been, alle þey ben gode to a synwe, þat is prikyde, wheþer þou put iche
be hymself oþer opyn hem; & þou schalt fynden a ful techynge of þese
medycines in þe Antitodarie of þis boke. Þou schalt nouȝt closen


      

a wounde, where þat þe prikynge of a synwe is, ere þan þe synwe be
perfitlye clansyde & helyd, & ere þou be sykere þat þe place schal nouȝt
swelle. Galyen tellyth of a man wiþ a poyntel in þe pawme of þe hand, to
whom come one of  Tesilies clerkys, þe whiche toke hede to
helyn alle woundis generalyche, & he leyde to þilke prikynge a
consoudynge oygnement þat was more acordynge to a wounde y-makede in
fflesch, & he leyde þereto a maturatyff plastre, where fore al þe hand
rotyd, & he fel into a crampe, & so he dyede ere þe vii dayes were
passyde; & ȝif þat þilke leche hadde y-made þilke wounde braddere, &
þenne & hadde y-helde in þe wounde hote oyle of rosys, and þenne hadde
abyde quyter wiþ hote medycines sotyl & dreying, & noȝt wiþ moiste
medycines, þilke man ne scholde nouȝt haue ben ded. Ȝif þat a synwe
hadde ben kut twart ouer al atwo þenne, þawȝ þat tedericus & summe oþere
sigge þe contrarye, hit is good þat þou sewe togedre þe hedys of þe
synwys þat beþ y-kutte, wiþ þe sowynge of þe skyn & abouen þilke maner
of sewynge, þe first day leye oyle of roses, in þe whiche oyle


      

Maddokkys, þat beþ wormys of þe erthe, haue ben boyllede; and caste
aboute þe wounde þe poudre þat kepyth þe sowynge a day oþer two
afterward, & kepe þe sowynge wiþ plumacioles þre kernellyde & wiþ  byndynge, & kepe þe lyme from swellynge, ffor by swyche a
manere sowynge of þe synwe þou maiste consoude þe synwe ageyn, for þe
lym scholde haue lost in party oþer in al the meuynge, þat was y-browȝt
to hym from þe brayn, for by þilke synwe þat lyme may rekeueren hys
felynge, & so þe restorynge of þe brayn may be more schaplokere &
fastere. Ne þou ne schalt noȝt drede of þe akynge þat scholde be made of
þe prekynge of þe nelde, for þe akþe schal be don awey by one leggynge
to oþere tweyne of þilke oyle; ne swyche manere akþe may noȝt make þe
crampe, for þe synwe ys al kutte atwo. Ne no man make an obiectioun wiþ
galyens wordys, þat we scholde be ware in ioyninge þe partyes of a
wounde togedre,  þat non here ne oyle ne scholde noȝt entre
wiþynne þe lippes 4of a wounde, þat beþ y-brouȝt togedre. To þilke
obiectioun we answeren, þat þe stipticite of þe roses & þe oyle þat was
nouȝt ripe, & þe glutinosyte of þe wormys of þe erthe remywen þe akþe of
þe synwes, & al þe harme þat scholde comen of þilke sewynge. Ȝif þat a
synwe were woundede in lengþe he may be wel & lyȝtlyche y-soudyde
togedire, wiþ


      

ioynynge of þe lippys & wiþ sowynge & wiþ kepynge of þe lym, þat he
scholde  noȝt. Understande here
in þis place, þat þere is no þynge more worschipful to a leche ne more
profytable to a seke man, þenne to kepe a lyme y-woundyde from
swellynge, & naþeles it is hard to kepe synwys þat beþ woundyde from
swellynge. Naþeles a leche here schal take hede aftere þe techynge þat
schal be geuen to hym in hys chapytell of þe cure of a wounde, whanne
þat þere ys wiþ hym a swellynge. Ȝif a wounde were chaungyd of þe eyre
and mad quyter, þat þe sowynge were tobroke, & þe punctis weren vndo,
þenne make a medycine mundyficatyff, & leye hym abrod on a lynne cloth,
& leye it aboue þe wounde, & put a lytel smal tent in þe one ende of þe
wounde þat is most declynynge; & þilke tent schal touche non synwe, ne
make non akþe, vndire þat þat þilke wounde be wel dryede. A
mundificatyff medycine of synwes y-woundyde ys y-made in þis manere: ℞.
mel rosat colat  iii smal floure of barly , & medle hem
togedre & boyle hem slyȝly þat þey brenne noȝt, & remywe hem from þe
fyre & bete hem togedre longe wiþ a spator, & þenne put þere to .
of whyte terbentyne, & ȝif þou maiste fynde no whyte terbentyne


      

wassche it wyth colde watyre, tyl it be whyt; & whenne þat by þis
medycine þe wounde is almost drye, þenne put in þe same medycine a lite
smal poudre of franke ensence, mastike, & sank dragoun, & medle hem to
gedre, & leye aboue þe wounde tyl it be al hol; & whanne þat it is hol
manye dayes aftere, leye flax in gode stronge hot wyn, tyl yt be al hol
perfitlyche. & ȝif þat þere leue enye hardnesse  in mevynge,
aftere þat it is hol, þenne þou schalt vse the techynge þat schal be
geuen to þe in þe laste tretys, þat schal be antitodarye in þe chapitle
of medycine, molyficatyffes; þere þou schalt fynde þe manere how þou
schalt helpyn beste lymes, þat beþ y-helyde & mowe noȝt ryȝt wel meffen.

The furþe techynge of þe firste tretys is of helynge of a wounde y-
makyde in bon.

Whenne þat woundes beþ so depe þat only þe flesch is nouȝt y-woundyde,
but þe bon þat is vndire þe flesch & þe synwe, þenne a man most byholde
wheþere þat þe bon be kut al atwo, as ofte tymes yt may happen in þe bon
of þe thyȝ & þe schynebonys, & þe bonys of þe Arme, & þenne þylke wounde
is ful perylouse; and namlye, ȝif þe bon of þe thyȝ ore þe bon of þe
arme, from þe schuldre to þe elbowe, be y-kutte al atwo, so þat þe marye
gon out. But ofte tymes


      

on bon of þe schyne, oþere in bon of þe Arme, ys ykutt al atwo
twartofere, & naþeles afterward may be restoryde; oþer a bon ys nouȝt
ykut al atwo, but sum of his substaunce ys done aweye, and þilke
substaunce oþere he ys don al aweye, oþere he hongyth to gedre. A
general rule ys in cure of woundes in whom bonys ben woundyde, þat
neuere by a leche flesch shal be y-sowdyd aboue þe bon, but first þe bon
plenerlyche be repeyrede; ffor þe bon may neuere with verrey
consolidacyoun ben consouded, for his matere was þe sperne of þe fadire
& þe modire, but in somme children for þe nyȝte of tyme þat þey were
sperme (sic); but þere schal be mad a manere restorynge in plas of þe
bon þat was broken oþere lost. þat men clepen porrus sarcoydes oþere
ellys caro poroydes, & þat manere thynge þat is restoryd is hardere þe
flesch & nesschere þen þe bon; & ȝif þat þilke mater þat is restoryde by
neye  as hard as yt were a bon, yt is clept porus sarcoydes;
& ȝif þat þilke mater be nouȝt harde, but sumwhat nessche, yt
is clepyde caro poroydes; ȝif þat a nesch fflesch & a moist were noȝt
regenered vpon bonys þat ben set togedre, a man scholde noȝt han his
purpos to helyn & to consoude þe wounde. Loke þenne wheþere þe bon be
kutte a-two


      

al togedre twartofere, þat þou brynge togedre, & bynde the partyes of þe
wounde as yt schal be tolde in þe eyȝte chapytell folwynge, where þou
schalt han hou a wonde schal ben helyde þat is out of joynt, y-kutte
atwo & tobroke. & ȝif þat a bon be noȝt kutte atwo al togedre
twartofere, loke ȝif enye pece of þe bon dwelle sadlyche to þe on partye
of þe hole bon, & þenne ȝif þou myȝte brynge þilke pece to þe place þat
he was yn tofore with þrustynge don þilke pece with sum Instrumentis
acordynge þereto, & sowde þilke pece wiþ þe hole bon with þe poudre, þat
y schal tellyn afterwarde; for so þe schap of the lyme may dwelle
fairere & strengere. & ȝif þat þilke pece haue no fastnesse to þe hole
bon, do þat pece awey, & þenne regenere in þe place of þe bon þat was
lost a repairment. Ffor þowȝ þat ypocras & Galyen tellyn þat it ys
necessarie aftere þe quantite of a bon þat is lost, an holwe cicatrice
to be alwey, naþeles wiþ þis poudre þe generacioun of þese pores may be
mendyde noȝt a lytel, but ryȝt myche. Þis is þe poudre: Take ffrank
ensence, Mastyke, Mirre, dragagantum gu. arabyke ana. . ij.,
flour of ffenngreke, , , cast þis poudre a gode
quantite vpon þe defaute of the bon þat was lost, tyl þat þou haue a
plenere repeyrment & a restauracioun. Þenne & noȝt ere brynge ouere
fflesch ouere þe repeyrment with generatyffes, mundificatyfes,


      

& consolidatyfes, aftere þe techynge that þou haddyst toforn.
Undirstonde þat alle þynge þat ys seyde of bonys in þis chapitle, ys of
alle þe bonys of þe body saff þe hed; & of þe bonys off the hed y schal
make a chapytle by hym-selff.

Þe ffye Chapitle of þe þridde techynge of þe furst tretis is of woundis
 that beth y-mad with smytinge.

The woundys þat beþ mad wiþ brosynge, as wiþ smytynge of a staf, oþere
ston, oþer fallynge, oþere wiþ smytynge of an hors, oþer wiþ enye thynge
semblable to hem, habbith gret differens from woundis þat beþ y-made wiþ
kuttynge: as wiþ swerde, knyf, ore arwe prikynge, & in oþere manere þey
schulle ben helyde. For þowȝ þat verreye consolidacioun be þe first & þe
princypal Intencioun of helynge of a wounde, to þis chapitle it acordyth
noȝt, ffor in smytinge, þe flesch & þe veynes, synwes & arteries ben y-
brusyde; for in þe ynnere part of þe lyme þe bon aȝeyne stonde, & on þe
vtter part þe þynge þat smyteth & kutteþ noȝt, wherefore it is
necessarie, ȝif þat þere scholde ben a wounde, þat alle þe smale lymes
þat beþ bytwene þe bon & þe þynge þat smyteth, scholde be brusyde; &


      

oþerwhyle þe flesch & þe oþere consimele membris beþ brusyde witout
wounde, wherefore þe cures of boþe y wyl ordeyne in this chapytle. Ȝif
þat a leche wolde enforce hym to Iune to gedire with consolidatyfes þe
wounde þat is mad wiþ smytinge, nedys  quyter & corupcioun
by þilke consolidatyff, most be vndire þe wounde; þe whiche quyter
scholde corumpe þylke lyme & brynge hym to putrefactioun, but ȝif þe
kynde were so myȝtye, þat he myȝte eftesonys opyne þylke wounde, þat was
consouded by a sorye leche, oþere þat a gode leche come & knewe þilke
dispocisioun, & couþe helpe wiþ propre cure to rettefien þe corupcioun
off þilke lyme. What schaltou þanne do? Þou most loke wheþere that þe
body be ful of yuell humores, oþer be clene; ȝif þat he be ful, lete hym
blod, ȝif alle partikelere þynges acorden: as vertu, Age, complexioun &
consuetude; & þese þynges þou most alweye taken in þy mynde, þowȝ alweye
þey ben nouȝt y-nempnyde, & namlye vertue; & he be nouȝt stronge & alle
oþere þynges acorden, þou schalt nouȝt leten blod, bot þou 
maiste ventosen, ȝif þat it be necessarie, oþer ellys lose þe wombe ȝif
þat he be costyff; & ȝif þat he be feble, & the brosure were in þe ouere
party of þe body, voyde þe feces of hys


      

wombe by clisterye. & ȝif þou wilt lete blod, þou shalt lete blod on þe
contrarye party of þe veyne, bryngynge norysschynge to þe lyme þat was
hurt; & þilke veyne þou schalt y-knowe, ȝif þat þou knowist plenerlyche
Anotamye, þat y haue tauȝte þe in þis same boke. & whenne þat þe body ys
y-clansyde, ȝif þat þe brosure be wiþout þe wounde, anoynt þe membre þat
is y-brusyde, whiche þat begynneþ to han a postum, wiþ hote oyle of
roses, & cast aboue a poudre y-mad of þe sed of mirtylles & bynde it
softlye, for ofte tymes it nedyth non oþer cure. For þis medycyne

his cure schal be seyde in þe tretys of apostomes & of exitures. But ȝif
þat þe brosure were wiþ a wounde, anoynte about þe wonde oþere ellys þe

is in þe place þat is brusyde. Wiþynne þe wounde leye þe ȝolke of an eye
with oyle of roses, with stupes oþere ellys wiþ lynte; & leye aboue þe
wounde a potage y-made off foure partyes of water & o partye of oyle
d'Olyve & floure off Whete þat suffyseþ to þe medycine, & leye þis
medycine to þe wounde, tyl þat þe akþe be aswagyde & tyl þat þe quyter

þe Antiodarie of mundificatyfes, maturatyfes, & ȝicatrisatifes.  But ȝif þat þe membre þat was y-brusyde ys ful of synwes, as þe
honde oþer þe fot, þou schalt noȝt chaunge þy cure ȝif þat þere be no
wounde; but þawȝ þat þere be a brusure in a synwy membre y-woundyde, ne
leye noȝt þere þe potage forseyd, but only hote oyle of roses, & aboue
þe oyle poudre of mirtilles, & aboue þe wounde leye terbentyne iwassche
& drawe abrod betwene tweye cloþes lynnen. & make enplastre of pych,

cure be drawe along, ne go noȝt awey fro þis cure; & whenne þat al þe
akþe ys y-sesyd, & alle þe swellynge ys aswagyde, forto clanse þe
wounde, vse þe medycine of mel rosat colat with


      

barly mele, y-sayd in the wounde of synwes. Þis cure ys aprefyde by
galyen, & y haue preffyde þis medycine ofte tymes.

 The sixte Chapitle of þe þridde techynge is of Woundes þat han
enpostemes, & beþ dystempryde.

A wounde þat hath aposteme oþer an yuel discrasie—þat is to sigge, out
of kynde distempride, oþere to hote oþere to cold, he may noȝt ben
helyd, ne schal nouȝt ben heled, but first þe posteme be aswagyde, & þe
yuele discrasie be amendide. & as y haue seyde, in an oþere place, yt is
profitable to þe syke man, & worschipful to þe leche, ȝif þat he mowe
dyffende þe lymes þat beþ woundyde fro eny postemys, & fro an euyll
discrasie. For þenne a leche schal kepe þe canon of galyen, þat is on of
foure canones; on is to kepyn lymes in here owne kendlye complexioun.
For woundys mowe noȝt ellys ben y-helyd, but ȝif þey ben brouȝt first to
here owne kynde, & þe wounde may be kepte from aposteme & an yuell
discrasie, ȝif þat þe leche be kunnynge & do hys deffere, & þe syke man
be obedyent to þe leche. Þe leche mot loke  ȝif þat þere haue
go blod ynowȝ out of þe wounde; & ȝif þat the wounde haue noȝt bled blod
ynowȝ, þe pacyent most ben lete blod, oþere ellys ben


      

ventusyde, takynge rewarde to alle partikelere þynges tofore seyde, &
ordeyne hym a couenable dyotynge, as schal be tolde in þe Chapitell of
dyotynge; & leye a defens aboute þe wounde:  j of bol Armonyake,
distemperid wiþ oyle of rosys & a lytel vynegre, to þe þiknesse of hony;
& ȝif þat þe tyme of þe ȝere were hot, put to þis medycine þe jus of sum
colde erbe: as morel, nyȝtschode, penywort, virge pastoris, oþere sum
oþer colde erbe; & bynde noȝt þe lyme to harde, ne lete noȝt þe lyme
hongyn; but ȝif it be þe arme, honge him aboute þe nekke; & ȝif it be þe
fot oþer þe schyne, lete hym ligge; & ȝif þat þe lyme akþe, aswage þe
akþe wiþ anoyntynge of hote oyle of roses. Ffor as Galyen seyth: þere is
noþynge more grefes, þan ys akynge & declynacioun of a lyme, for þese
two makiþ sone an hote swellynge, the whiche is to þe ffeuyre as a
welle, & to þe body as an Ovyn. Þe woundyde man most absteynen hym,
aftere þat þe chapitell of dyetynge techith; & boþe þe syke man & þe
leche, & alle þat ben aboute þe syke, mote absteynen hem from fleschlye
knowlachynge of a womman, ne a womman in tyme of menstrewe, ne loke
noȝt on þe syke man; & onys in þe day þe syke man schal schyte, & ȝif he
may noȝt schyte kendly onys in þe day,


      

after þe quantyte of mete þat he haþ takyn, make hym a clistry, oþer a
suppositorye onys iche day. & ȝif þou maiste noȝt with alle þese þynges
defendyn þe lyme from aposteme, yt is an yuele signe, for þe lyme ys
feble, & þe humores ben wykkede; þen begynne to maturen þe swellynge,
with potage y-made off flour, oyle & water, oþer ellys with þis
maturatyff: ℞ malwe leuys, leffys of vyolett, & þe rote of holy hokke;
seþe hem  wel in water, & þanne stampe hem, & take a pounde
off þe water þat þey be sodyn yn, & of comyn oyle  iij, of whete
flour  iij, of flour of lynsed .. j, of flore vynegreke
 , of erbys i-stamped .  ; &
boylle alle þese togedire, in a pan ouere þe fyre, & stire yt wel wiþ a
spator; & þis maturatyff leye on a lynne cloth, & leye on þe posteme,
tyl þat yt be maturyd; & whanne þat þe posteme is matured, make þe
quyter, ȝif þou maist, ben y-cast to þe wounde; & ȝif it may noȝt ben y-
cast to þe wounde, opyne þe place þat ys most lowest þere, as þe quyter
may best gone out; & þan helyn þe wounde, as y schal tellyn, in þe
þridde chapytell of Apostemys. Take hede alweye to þis techynge, þat ȝif
a posteme were for þe prikynge of a synwe, ne leye noȝt þereto þis
potage maturatyff, but wyt þe vncture of oyle of roses & of oþer þynge,
as yt is seyde in þe woundys of synwys. Þou schalt


      

y-knowe þe euyll dyscrasie of a wounde, ȝif þat þou sest the schyn þat
is aboute þe wounde to reed, & to hot in felynge, þenne þe wounde is
discrasyede in hete, namly ȝif þat þere come out of þe wounde a sotyll
qyter & a red; & þilke discrasye þou schalt helpen with coldynge þe lyme
aboute þe wounde, with oyle of roses, & with vnguentum album—rasis of
ceruse—whyche þou schalt fynde in þe Antodarie, & wiþ ius of oþere colde
erbys. & þou schalt knowe a colde discrasye by þe whitnesse oþer þe
wannesse of þe place, & whanne þe place ys colde in touchynge, & whanne
þat þe quyter is thykke; the whiche discrasye þou schalt remeffen, by þe
vncture of hote oyles, as oyle of cost, oyle lauryne, oyle of enforbium,
& so oþer hote oyles. A moiste discrasie þou schalt knowe by þe
nesschenesse of þe place, & by þe Abundaunce of whit lyquyde rotnesse,
þe whiche þou schalt helpyn with defficatyffes: as with wasschynge of

& þe smalnesse of þe lippes of þe woundes & litel quyter, ȝif þat the

schalt helpen wiþ castynge on of hote water, tyl þat þe lyme wexe rede,
& with an oyntynge of moiste grecys, as hennys, gosys & dokys, & þe

as þe brothys of flesch, & temperat wyn, & rere eyren, & smale fyssches,
& oþere gode þynges, & with reste and with softnesse of alle þe body &

sone as a membre ys y-broȝt to his kendlye dysposicioun, anon aȝeyne
stonde with contraryouse medycine, & turne aȝeyne to þe pryncipal cure
of þe wounde. But þynke noȝt to helyn þe wounde, as longe as þe wounde
ys apostomyde, oþere ellys haþ an yuele discrasye, but first remywe
þilke discrasye ere þan þou hele þe wounde. For whenne þat tweye þynges

Ne nevere þe latere ne forȝete noȝt þy pryncipal cure, þat whanne the
accidentes ben asesyde, turne aȝeyne to þe princypale cure.


      

 The vij Chapitelle of þe þridde techynge is off a wounde y-made of a
wod hounde, oþere of eny oþere venymouse bestys.

Whenne þat an hounde hath byten a man, ffirste loke ȝif þat þe hounde be
wod; & ȝif þat þe hounde be noȝt wood, hele þe wounde as þou dost oþere
comyn woundys; & ȝif þat þe hounde were wood, þou schalt y-knowe yt by
certeyne causes, & by disposiciouns. Ffor a wod hounde fleyth
mete, & ffleyth watere, & oþerwhyle he dyeth whenne þat he seþ water; &
he rennyth hydirwarde & þedirwarde, as a dronken man, wiþ opyn mouþ &
hys taylle bytwene his leggys, hys tunge hongyth out, he wolde byte alle
men, ne he ne knowyth nouȝt þo men þat ben his housholde, he berkyth
noȝt; & ȝif þat he oþerewhyle berke, hys voys ys ful hors, & oþere
houndys flen from hym & berkyn vpon hym. Also þou schalt y-knowe by
dysposicioun of þe same wounde, for ȝif þat þou wetyst a crumme bred in
þe blod of þe wounde & geuyste yt to an oþer hounde to etyn, he wyl noȝt
etyn yt, & ȝif þe hounde etyþ yt he wyll deyen; oþere ellys take a note
& stampe yt, & leye on þe wounde al nyȝt, & on þe morwe ȝif yt to an
henne, sche wyl noȝt etyn hyt; & ȝif sche etyth yt sche wyl deyen. &
anone as þou wost þe hounde ys


      

wod, sette a gret ventuse aboue þe wounde & drawe out myche blod out of
þe wounde, & afterwarde drawe abrod þe wounde; & abouen alle oþere
thynge brennynge of hote eyren to þe depþe of þe wounde ys most
proffytable, & aftere leye aboue þe wounde attractyfes, to drawe out þe
venym. Some of þese attractifes beþ symple, & some beþ componyd. Symple
ben: þe lyffere of þe same wod hounde þat bote þe man, garlyke y-
stampyde, salt fyssch, asschys of vyne, Opopanac ys wondirful, þe leuys
of a Gourde, & þe rote of ffynegreke, þe gele of fyssches, & amptes y-
stampyde. Þese medycynes ben componyde: vryne of a ȝonge man, with nytre
oþer myntes, i-stampyde with salt & distempred with vynegre, & y-mad in
emplastre. An oþere medicyne componyd: ℞ floris eris & salt ana ten
parties, & þe fat of a calff twelf partyes, & make a plastre. An oþere:
take schepys talwȝ & buttre, & make emplastre. Þis wounde schal ben y-
holde opyne at þe leste fourty dayes; al þis schal be do about þe place.
 In an oþere manere regimen vndirstande, þat þe man þat is y-
bete ne schal nouȝt be lete blod in the bygynnynge, lest þe venym be
drawe abrod by oþere lymes. Ne þou ne schalt ȝif hym non laxatyff, lest
yt drawe þe venym to þe entraylles withynne; but þou schalt setten on þe
place a stronge


      

ventuse, as yt is seyde tofore, þat he mowe drawe myche of þe blode. &
whenne þat þre dayes ben passyde, yt is nouȝt yuele to leten blod, & to
purge with a lyȝt purgacioun, þat purgith þe malyncolye, as with
decoccioun of Epytemum, with gotys wheyȝ; & norissche hym with dyetynge,
þat fattyth hym & make glad & bliþe; & wassche hys hed with decoccioun
of water, þat þe fet & þe hed of a weþire ben y-sodyn yn. Ne lete hym
nouȝt þrustyn, ne suffren hungyre ne trauell, & so ȝif þat god wyl, þou
maiste kepen hym from peryle. & euery day to a moneþ ende, he schal
taken oþere symple medycynes, oþer componed. Symple buþ: Asa ffetida.
Asa dulsis, polm,  terra sigillata, Wermot, Kockull,
 mirre & gencyane.
Medycynes componed gode: ℞ þe assches of crabbys y-brent in an
Offyn .iiij partyes, of ffrankensens vij partyes, make a poudre; þe
pacient schal take iche day of þis poudre  .ij wiþ wyn. An oþer: ℞
þe poudre of crabbys y-brende vj partyes, of gencyane iij. parties,
terre sigillate one partie, make poudre. Ȝif þat þou were noȝt at þe
bygynnynge, & he bygynneth to haue yuele Accidentes, as yuele þouȝtes,
schrewyde metynge in his slepe, & þat he be wroth & grucche & wot noȝt
why, & ȝif men aske hym enye þynge he ȝeuyth no gode answere þere to, &
ffleyþ lyȝt, & he hath alle oþere signes of malencolye, þanne ȝif to hym
a medycine y-made


      

of cantarydes. Take olde grete kantarydes & do aweye þe hed & þe wynges
ȝ. ij., lentys I-clansed ȝ. j., saferen, spikenard, clowys, canell ana
ȝ. .—in oþere bokys—ipone hem wel & make of hem smale ballys
þat weyȝen j. penye wyȝt; & ȝif a ball at þre tymes, at iche tyme þe
wyȝt of vij cornys of whete, tyl þat he pysse blod, for þenne he schal
be saff. Ffor whenne þou art sykere, hele þe  wounde after
þat fourty dayes ben passyde, in þe same maner. Ȝif þat a wounde were
mad of þe bytinge of an eddre, oþere of eny oþere venymouse beste, þe
leche schal take hede to drawe abrode þe wounde & setten abouen a
ventuse & drawe out myche blod, & yt is myche worþ to enviroun þe place
abouten þat is y-betyn wiþ brome y-stampyde. Ffor ȝif þat þe prikynge be
in þe fot oþere in þe hande, ȝif þou enviroun þe arme oþere þe legge
with brome, yt latteþ þe venym to gone vpwarde; & ȝif hym þe medycines
y-wryten aboue, & also tryacle, & lete þe wounde be opyne, tyl al þe
venym be escludyde.

The viij. Chapytelle of þe þridde techynge of the ffirste tretys is of a
wounde y-made in a joynt & is dislocat.

Whenne þat a wounde is in a lyme & þe bon of þe same lyme ys tobroken
atwo & is dislocat—þat is to sigge, out of joynt,


      

þanne it is gode þat þou putte in þe wounde, whanne þe blod is y-
staunchyde, & also aboue þe wounde, þe ȝolke of an eyȝe, with oyle of
roses, & anoynt alle þe lyme aboute þe wounde, wiþ two partyes of oyle
of rosys, & wiþ half on party of vynegre, y-made þikke with bol
Armonyake, tyl þat þe quyture be engendered,  & þou be
sykere þat none Aposteme schall come. Ne take none hede to brynge
togedere þe parties of þe bon þat is tobroken oþere dislocat, tyl viij
daies ben go in þe wyntire, & fyff in the somere; for þenne yt schal
make quytere, & be sykere from swellynge; & þenne brynge togedire þe
brekynge oþere þe dysynncture aftere þe techynge þat schal be seyde in
þe Chapytell of Algebra. & ȝif þat þe brekynge oþere þe dyslocacioun
nedyþ splyntes, make þat þe splyntes & þe byndynge faylen aboue þe
wounde; & þat þou maiste do, ȝif þat þou kyttest þe splyntes & þe
byndinge aboue þe wounde with a knyf oþere a rasoure, & in drawynge
abrod þe hole of þe bonde aboue þe wounde  wiþ a nedle, so
þat þou maiste by þilke hole euery day chaungen þe medycine of þe wounde
withouten chaungynge of þe bonde, þat þou madest firste aboute þe bonys
þat were broke oþere dislocat. Þe whiche bonde þou schalt nouȝt
remeffen, tyl þe tyme þat schal be tolde in hys place; bote you schalt
bynde aboue þilke


      

bonde a newe bonde, þe whyche þou schalt remeffe, as often as þou
chaungiste thy wounde. & whanne þou art sykere from empostomynge & þou
haue sette togedire þe bonys þat were sette togedire & dislocat, þenne
leye vpon þe wonde by þe hole þat þou madyst in þe band a mundifycatyff
of mel rosat colat, & of barlye mele, tyl þe wonde be clansyde; & leye
on þilke mundyficatyff þredys of olde clene whyte lynne cloþ, tyl þat þe
wounde be ful clansyde; afterward regenere fflesch, & aftereward
consoude wiþ regeneratyfes & consolidatyfes, whiche þat schullen ben
seyde in þe ende of þe boke.

The ix Chapitle of þe þridde techynge is of fflux blod off a wounde.

Þere beþ two manere causes þat makyth blod to bleden out of mannes body;
þat on cause is clepyde cause conjuncte, & þat oþer cause antecedent. Þe
encheson of cause conjuncte ys openynge of þe mouþes of þe veynes & þe
Arteries, oþer ellys whanne þat the veynes beþ kut atwo, oþer ellys
corosion of þe bodyes of þe same veynes & arteries, oþer ellys to gret
feblenesse, oþere to gret losnesse. & þere beþ manye enchesouns & causes
antecedente: as to myche


      

fulnesse of blod, oþer ellys to myche Acuyte of blod & also manye oþere
causes; and þere beþ oþere causes þat beþ clepyd causes prymytiff; as
smytinge þat wondiþ, to gret lepynge, cryinge, wraþþe, chydinge, & so
many  oþer & iche of þese causes tofore seyde haþ hys manere
helynge by hym-selfen in fesyke medecynal. Bot it ys noȝt þe entencyoun
of þis boke, to tretyn but of blod, þat blediþ of wounde, þat is y-mad
wiþ wounde, the  whiche may be restreynde by crafte of
surgerye. In flux of blod, that comyth of a wounde, þe leche most loke
þe disposicioun, þe Abytude, Age, vertu & complexioun of hym þat is y-
woundyde; & ȝif þat þese acorden, & he be myȝtye in vertue, he schal
blede myche blod at hys wounde, þowȝ þat þe leche be clepyde at þe
bygynninge, bot ȝif it so be þat he feble ouere gretlyche. & ȝif nede
constreyne þe leche to staunche þe blode, he most loke ȝif þat þe blod
go out of þe Veynes capyllares, þat beþ smale veynes as herys of mannys
hed; & þanne only þe whyte of an eyȝe, y-leyde aboue wiþ towȝ of flex
suffiseþ, whenne þat þe parties of þe wounde beþ brouȝt togedire; & ȝif
þou cast aboue þe poudre of lyme, tofore seyde in the chapytell of
sowynge of woundes, yt schal be þe betyre; for þe poudre wiþstreyneþ þe
blod & consoudeþ þe partyes of þe wounde, togedire.


      

& ȝif þe blod come from gret Veynes, he may noȝt so sumtyme be
constreynde, but it nediþ a strengere medycyne & also a more cautele; &
ȝif þat þe blod go out of an arterye, þou schalt y-knowe yt be
constructioun & dilatacioun, of þe same arterye—þat is to sigge, þat þe
blod goþ out with lepynge, & oþer whyle with wiþdrawynge, & þenne sette
þy fyngere vpon þe mouþ of þe gret veyne, oþere ellys þe Artarye, &
holde þy fyngere þere on by a grete oure; for þenne by hap sum grete
drope of blod may be congelyde togedre, & þereby vertu may be myche y-
comfortyde. Afterewarde leye plentyfullyche of þis medycine vpon þe
 Veyne oþere þe arterye þat is kut
atwo. ℞ ffrancencens, whyȝt gommous & fat ȝ. ii., Aloes ȝ. i., make
poudre & distempre with þe whyȝt of an eyȝe as þykke as hony; after take
herys of an hare smale & kutte, medle al þis þynge togedire, & þere ys
no medycine so gode as þis medycine is, in streyninge of blod &
consoudynge þe Veyne. Bot whanne þat þou comyst to chaunge þe medycine
of þy wonde, do noȝt awey þe medycine wiþ strengþe, but  leye
aboue of þe same medycine moist, to nessche þe firste medycine, þat yt
myȝte fallyne awey by yt-selff. Naþeles yt is possible, þat a medycine
caustyke, þat ys to sigge a medycine


      

þat brennyth, sennore staunchyth blod, þenne þis medicine of encense; &
þou schalt haue gret plente of medycine caustyke in þe antitodarye, but
we beþ nouȝt sykere þat þe blod of þe Veyne, oþere þe arterye an oþer
tyme wyl gon out, whanne þat þe serche of þylke caustyke medycine ys
remywed awey. But þy medycine of ensence, with þe herys of an hare, noȝt
only staunchiþ þe blod, but also consoudeþ þe Veyne, & þe Arterye, as y
haue preuyde yt ofte tymes. And forto ȝif Autorite, I sette an saumple,
þat come sum tyme to myn handys: A childe of þre ȝere olde, hadde a lyte
knyf in hys hande, & he fel on þat knyf, & þe poynt of þe knyf, in þe
fore partye of þe þrote, persyde þe Veyne organys; ne þere ne couþe no
man yt staunche, & þanne y was y-clepyde & y come to þe child in gret
haste, & he hadde almoste loste hys syght; for hys eyȝen in hys hed were
turnyde vp so doun, & þe blode come out of þe wounde, whyte as wheyȝe,
ne he ne hadde no pous, & þenne y leyde my fyngere on þe hed of þe
veyne, & y helde faste þat noþynge myȝte go out, & so y helde þe veyne
by a grete houre, & þe vertue of hys body þat was almost lost quyknede
aȝeyne, & þe pous bygan to apere ffeblyche as yt were a smal þreed. Þanne y


      

sente to þe spysers schoppe, þat was a grete weye from me, ne y ne
remywede noȝt awey my fyngere from þe place tyl þat þe messagere come
aȝeyne, & þe childe þenne bygan to opene hys eyȝen; and þanne y ordeynde
þilke medycine to be mad, & plentyffuliche y leyde it abouen þe wounde,
and y bonde þe wounde with plumaceoles & with stupes y-leyde in whyȝt of
an eyȝe, & with a bande y bonde yt streytlye, & y comaundede hem to
gyuen hym crommys of brede, y-leyde in water; and on þe morwene y come
aȝeyne, & þenne y fonde þe childe y-cunffortede & neuere þe latere y
wolde nouȝt vndo þe medycine; þe ffadire  preyde me wiþ grete
instaunce to se þe wounde, but y wolde nouȝt; & so y lete yt be, tyl
foure dayes were passyd, withouten remeffynge & naþeles y vysitede hym
every day; in þe fourþe day y vndyde þe bande, & þe medycine was drye
aboue þe wounde, so þat y myȝte noȝt haue remywede hyt withouten grete
Vyolence. & þenne y leyde aboue þe whyte of an eyȝe, with a lytel oyle
of roses, & so y lafte yt by on day. On þe morwen y turnyde aȝeyne, &
þenne y remeffyde awey þe medycine withouten Vyolence, & þenne y fonde
þe wounde & þe Veyne al hol. And of þis helynge þe fadire & alle his
neyȝhboures hadden gret wondire. And ȝif þat with þis medicyne þou
maiste noȝt soude þe Arterye, ne þe Veyne, ne þou ne maiste noȝt
constreyne þe blod for sum oþere Impedement,


      

þan þou moste oþere bynde þe Veyne, oþere drawyne here out of here
place, & wynde þe hed of þe Veyne oþer Arterye, oþer þou most brenne
here wiþ hote yren, & maken on here hed a grete croste & a depe. An
oþere exaumple: þere was a childe of xv ȝere olde, þat smot hym-self
with a smal knyff, & þilke knyff persyde on Veyn of þe Arme, & prikyde a
Veyne þat lay vndire þilke synwe. & for þe prikynge of þilke synwe he
hadde grete akynge, & blod ran to þe wounde & noȝt aȝeynestondynge
medycines þe blod ran out at þe wounde. Kolde medycines weren profitable
to bledynge of wounde, and colde medycines beþ greffes to prikynge of

and þenne y demyde necessarye to drawe out alle þe Veyne out of here
place & to bynde here & to helpen þilke synwe with oyle of roses. But þe
modire of þilke childe sende for a lewyde leche, whyche þat reprevyde
fouliche my doom, & he behyȝte to helyn safflyche þe childe. He dwellyde
on þe cure, & y went my weye. Þe whyche leche toke hede to hym be ten
dayes, þat neiþere þe akynge sesyde ne þe blod was noȝt y-staunchyde, &
so þe syke man was  nyȝh ded. And at þe laste y was clepyde &
y wolde noȝt come to þe pacient. But þenne a ffysisyen þat was frende to
þe man of þe pacyent, blamyde þe modire & here frendys, þat þey hadde
lefte my consaylle


      

for þe byhestys of þylke ydyote; & þilke ffysisyens proposyde, aftere
þat he had herde my counseylle, þat þere was non oþere wey þat myȝte
saue þe syke man from þe deþ, & þenne he askyde a surgyne, wheþere he
couþe don as y hadde seyde byfore; & he seyde þat he couþe so don, & so
he dyde. He kutte þe skyn aboue þe Veyne, & twynede þe veyne in his
handys, & bonde þe ende of þe Veyne wiþ a þrede, & afterwarde he hylde
on þe synwe hote oyle of rosys, & so by þis counseyle he was restoryde
aȝeyne to hele. But ho so þat wolde aske how þat he myȝte so manye dayes
be kepyde from þe crampe, for þat he suffryde so grete akþe, I answere &
sigge: þat þe cause was, for he bledde at þe wounde eche day, so þat þe
synwe ne myȝte noȝt be to myche replet oþere fulfyllede of blode. Alle
þese thynges y haue tolde, þat he þat redyth hem may þe wyslocor in
semblable causes wyrchen. And ȝif be þis medycyne he myȝte noȝt
sykerliche be restreynede, þat fallyth ryȝte selden, þenne me moste
brenne þe hed of þe Veyne oþere of þe synwe wiþ hote yren, þat þilke
hote yren myȝte maken an harde croste. And be war þat þou touche noȝt þe
lippes of þe wounde, ne þe synwe, ne non oþere thynge, bot only þe veyn
with hote yren. And ȝif al þis crafte wolde noȝt helpyn me, men most
drawen out þe Veyne, &


      

flene þe flesch aboue here & wynde þe Veyne sadlyche & bynde here hed
with þyn handys. And sum tyme yt happyth, þat an Arterye is y-broke

 The x Chapitle of þe þridde techynge of þe firste tretys is of men

Many men discorden of dietynge of men þat ben woundyde, for sum men
ȝeuen to alle men þat ben woundyde, wheþer þat it be in þe hed oþer in

& engendrith Apostemys & corumpyth & feblyth complexiouns, & makyth many

considerynge resoun of þe complexioun of hym þat is y-woundyde. The
firste secte of þese seyth þat some men, onlye etynge bred & watere, in

to hele with here woundys, bot þey ben so feble þat þey dyȝen, oþere

woundyde a gret enposteme & a ffeuyre— and þo beþ ȝonge men þat beþ of
an hot complexioun & a moyst— wherefore þey comaundyde to alle oþere
manere complexiouns, þat þey scholde noȝt drynken no wyn, ne eten non

þerefore y folwynge þe doctryne of rasys, Avence, galien, & of oþer

For þere nys noþynge þat so sone smyteþ with grevaunce þe hed oþere þe

he ne schal noȝt aftere on manere of counseylle proceden in hys dyetynge.

 The xi. Chapitle of þe þridde techynge of þe firste tretys is of olde
woundes.

 Olde woundes ben mad of kuttynge oþer of openynge of a posteme, oþere
ellys of a wounde þat is noȝt helyde in his tyme, oþer ellys of sum
manere fleynge oþer of brennynge, oþer of to grete hete, oþer of to
grete drovþe, oþer to gret colde constreynynge, oþere of to grete
Abundaunce of moist mater corumpynge. For euery olde wounde, hauynge
rotenesse oþere virus þat is þenne venemy quyter, oþer eny oþer þynge
þenne gode quyter nys noȝt y-clepyde wounde, but is y-clepyde vlous þat
is an olde wounde. And of þis Vlcus, Rouland & Rogerine, & þe most
partye of men þat ben now, clepyde it festre, oþer cancre. But it is
neiþere festre ne cancre, but festre & cankre habbe dyfference from þis.
 Vlcus, as a propre þynge hath dyfference, from a þynge, þat
is comyn; for euerye festre & euerye cankere, þat is y-woundyde, ys y-
clepyde Vlcus, but yt ne syweth noȝt þat euerye Vlcus, ys clepyde cankre
oþere festre, as y schal


      

tellen opynlyche in euerye chapytell be hym-self. Auesene seyth þat þere
ben sixe manere of þese Vlcus, for sum ben Venemy, sum hory, some depe,
some cauernouse oþere y-hud, sum corosyff, sum rotyne, some Ambulatyff—
þat is spredynge abrode, & some hard to consouden. Of þese manerys
tofore seyde, some hath acordynge with festres in toknes & in fourmes:
as Venemy & holwy, & sum han acordynge with cancre: as spredynge abrode
& fretynge hym self. And naþeles þey habbe difference as yt is
conteynede in þe chapytelles of cancre y-woundyde & of festre. & alle
þese tofore seyde habbith difference from a wounde, for in a wounde þere
ys whyte quyter & euene in al his partyes & hol & noȝt departyde, —&
withouten stynke. Þis manere of quyter is engendrede, of godnesse of
kendlye hete & is perfitlye deffyede. But vemyn, rottenesse, & croste, &
alle oþere superfluyte of olde woundes ben engendred of a straunge
vnkendlye hete. A venemy Vlcus is, in whom habundeþ venym sotyl &
liquydy. Ȝif þat yt be red oþere ȝolwe, oþere a partye redyssche, &
scharpe bytynge þe lyme, hit synifieþ lordschipe of straunge hete. An
hory olde wounde ys y-clepyd, þat haþ sum grete crostes, oþere ellys sum
grete awrotynge


      

proud flesch to hyȝe. A depe Vlcus is þat þat haþ a gret depnesse & an
holwe, & peraunter crokynge. A wrotynge vlcus is þat of hys malyce
wroteþ, bycause þat þe blod þat is sent to hym, is to scharpe. Galien:
scharpe blod noȝt onlyche cordyth noȝt flesch in woundes, but also hol
flesch. A rotyde vlcus is stynkynge, habbynge a straunge hete in his
grounde, & out of hym passith out a stynkynge smel oþere smoke, as þere
doþ  out of flesch þat is y-rotyde. A walkynge Vlcus is þat
walkeþ hyderwarde & þedirwarde & naþeles he profundeþ noȝt depe into þe
grounde. An Vlcus þat is hard to helyn, is he þat for his yuele
proprete, þat is sende to hym fro al þe body, latteþ hym to hele. &
forto helyn euery manere of þese hulkes, þere ben manye dyverse rulys.
Þe firste rule ys þat þey mowe noȝt ben helyde, but þe superfluytes þat
ben in hem ben dryed. Þe secunde rule ys þat ȝif þat þe body oþere
membre be out of hys naturell complexioun, ere þan þou þynke to hele
þilke Vlcus, þou moste bryngen aȝeyne to hys due


      

complexioun distempride  þilke body oþer membre. Þe
þridde rule ys, þat ȝif þat þe lyfere oþere splene ben y-greuyde, as yt
happyth ofte tymes in olde woundes, þou most retyfien hem. The fourth
rule ys: þat þe qualites & quantytes of humours scholde be tempride with
blodletynge, & purgatiouns & with gode governaylle; and ȝif þat þe eyre
be yuel, þe syke man schal be chaungyde into gode eire. And whanne þat
þe leche haþ tofore seye alle þese þynges, þenne he may go to hys cure.
& ȝif þat þe Vlcus be Virulente, þat is to sigge Venemy, loke ȝif þat þe
Venym þat goþ out be redyssch oþere ȝolwe, & ȝif þat the lyme haue enye
manere hete; & þenne wassche it wiþ water þat rosys & barlyche Alum &
balaustia & lentilis with honye symple oþere componed ben sodyn In. And
lete þis watere percen to þe depthe of þe wounde. And ȝif þe Virus be
withouten hete & þe membre haue non hete, wassche it with water oþere
wyþ wyn, þat Mirre, wermot, horhowne, sauge, pympirnel, honye symple
oþer componed ben sodyn In. Clanse þe wounde perfitlye & engendre flesch
& afterwarde consoud it with þis propre oygnement, þat in olde foule
venemy woundys oþer Vlcus engendreth


      

flesch, clansyth & helyth as Auecene & Rases wytnessith, litargium
nutritum. ℞ litarge as myche as þou wylt & stampe it & put it in a
mortere &  putte wiþ hym gode oyle of roses & vynegre, now þe
on now þe oþere, alweye steryinge, tyl it be perfitlyche augmentyd &
come to þe fourme of an oygnement. & þis oygnement—litargirum nutritum—
þat is to sigge litarge y-noryssched, þat is profitable in many casis.
Afterwarde take of þilke litarge viij partyes, & of alym, & of balaustie
oþere ellys, in þe stede of balaustye, wormys of þe erþe y-brend, brend
bras, brent led, gallys, sanke dragoun, cathimie, Argenti ana as mychel
as ys .xij partyes of alle þe oygnement, and medle al togedre, & make an
Oygnement. Þis oygnement schal be leyde withynne þe woundes & aboue þe
wounde, for yt dryeth þe wounde, & engendrith gode flesch & consoud.
Take hede to þis rule, þat in helynge of alle olde woundes, aftere þat
þey ben clansyde, aboue þe oygnement yt is gode of one a lynnen cloþ,
forto dystende abrode on of þe mundyficatyfes of hony whiche þat schulle
be tolde in þe antitodarye. And leye aboue aboute þilke vlcus, &
specialiche from þe ouere partye, fro whom humores flotyn, a 
defensif of bol Armonyake & terra


      

sigillata þat is mad on þys manere: ℞ bol armoneake  j terre
sigillate  ., oyle of rosis & vynegre, þat suffyseþ, now
do in þe on, now þe oþer, tyl þe oygnement be ful mad & lyquyde ynowȝ;
so þat of þe oyle of roses be duble as myche as of þe vynegre. Þis
diffensiff defendiþ a membre fro corupcioun, & also Vlcus þat he sprede
noȝt abrode. An hory wonde ys y-helyde, in remeffynge awey þe croste
oþere þe fylthe þat is in hym with poudre of affodylles schal be sayde
in þe ende, oþere with sum oþere mundificatyfes; afterwarde consoude yt
with consolydatyfes. A depe wounde ys y-helyde in castynge in to þe
 depþe of þe wounde with an instrument y-mad to þe lyknesse
of a clisteyre, any of þe wasschynges þat beþ seyde in þe Venemy wounde
aboue, after þat þe disposisioun of þe membre askeþ of hete oþer of
cold. And aftere þat he is y-clansyde, in castynge in water oþere in wyn
þat mastyke oþere frankensence ys y-soden yn, & in leggynge without, on
of þe mundificatyfes of hony, þat schal be sayde aftere. & also it is
gode to ordeyne þe lyme, so þat þe mouth of þe wounde honge dunwarde, &
streyne þi ligature at þe grounde of þy wounde & bynde it looslye at þe
mouþ of þe wounde. And also yt were gode, ȝif þat it myȝte be, þat þere
were made a newe wounde in þe place þat is most hongynge þat þe


      

rotnesse & þe quytere myȝte þe betyre gone out, for so þilke Vlcus myȝte
sunnere be helyde. A ffretynge vlcus ys y-helyde, in leggynge
specialiche aboute hym colde þynges, whiche þat obtunden oþer castyn
bach þe scharpnesse of þe same Vlcus, & also in amendynge with metys &
with drynkes the scharpnesse of þe same blod, & in purgynge þe rede
colore & with anoyntynge wiþ colde oygnementes & consolidatifes, &
þereto is myche worþ vnguentum album Rasis, þat schal be told in þe
antitodarye. A stynkynge wounde ys y-helyde in remevynge awey þe stenche
& þe rottenesse, & þerto ys myche worth a wasschynge of ydromel þat is
hony & water y-sode togidre wiþ mirre, & a mundyficatiff y-mad with Ius
of wermot & barly mele & hony & mirre, þat is made on þis manere: take
jus of wermot .. iiij, of hony  iij, of barly mele .ȝ. ij,
off mirre  .j., compone hem togedire, & fulle þe wounde, wiþynne
forth wiþ lynete of lynnen cloþ. & ȝif þat wormys ben engendride in þe
wounde, sle hem wiþ jus of calamynte, oþere with þe juse of þe leuys of
pechys, oþere ellys persicarie, oþer with decoccion  of
ellebre. And whanne þat a perfyte mundyficacioun is mad engendre flesch
& consoude, as yt is seyde tofore. A walkynge Vlcus ys y-helyde with
flebotomye & ffarmasye þat is laxatyfes purgynge þe colere &


      

brende humoures, & in leggynge aboute a defensif of bol & terra
sigillata þat is seide tofore in þe same Chapytle, & with on of þe colde
mundyficatyfes & sum tyme men most cauterise þe Vlcus aboue with an
instrument of gold. for þilke manere of brennynge rectefieþ wel þe
membre. Þe cause why þat sum Vlcus is hard to consoude is, for an yuel
disposicion ys y-hydde in þe bodye, & þerefore it nedyth to retyfien þe
membre & þe body as y haue seide to-fore. And ȝif þe cause be opene, on
oþere manye, do aweye þilke causes oþer ellys þo manye causes, ere þanne
þou go to þe pryncipal cure. Þese ben þe causes þat lettyn consoudynge
of olde woundes, an yuele disposisioun of alle þe body: as dropsye, oþer
ellys an iuele disposisioun of þe lyuere: as ȝif þat he be to feble, as
to hot oþere to colde, to moiste oþere to drye, with mater ore withouten
matere, as wiþ to grete hardnesse; oþere ellys þe spleen is to feble to
purge þe malancolyent blod; oþere ellys to myche blod, oþere ellys to
acute blod; oþere ellys þe veynes beþ to ful of blod, þat goþ doun to þe
Vlcus; oþer ellys curnellys þat glandeles, þat beþ kurnellys þat beþ in
þe grynde, þat sendiþ doun matere to þe Vlcus þat is in þe thyȝes & þe
legges, oþer ellys þe lippes of þe Vlcus beþ to grete & hard, oþere
ellys to myche flesch, oþer ellys mysordeyninge of


      

dyetynge, oþer ellys an vncouenable medycine to þilke membre, oþer ellis
þe lyme þat ys y-hurt haþ an yuele discrasie, oþere ellys þilke Vlcus is
an yuele place—as in þe ende of þe elbowe, oþere ellys þe Vlcus ys al
rounde, oþere ellys þe bon þat is vndire  þe vlcus is
corupte. Alle þese tofore seide letteþ Vlcus to by helyde, wherefore yt
nediþ þe, to take kepe to alle þese thynges tofore seyde, & to amendyn
alle þe body, & namlye þe lymes þat habbiþ principalte in mannes body, &
kepe alle þe lymes þat beþ in here naturell disposisioun wiþ þynges þat
beþ acordynge to here naturel disposisioun, & ȝif þey ben discrasyede,
remywe þilke discrasye with þat, þat is contrarye to þilke discrasye.
Also tempre þe qualyte & þe quantyte of þe blod, & streyne þe veynes ȝif
þat þey brynge þedire blod. Oþer ellys ȝif it is possible, lete þe blod
aweye. Vndo glandeles, þat beþ kurnell þat sendeþ þedire mater, & remywe
ded flesch, smale lippes of þe woundes þat beþ grete, & kytte hem awey,
ȝif þou maiste do non oþere weys; amende his dyetynge, & brynge aȝeyne
þe roundnesse of þilke Vlcus in to a longe fourme, aftere þe lengþe of
þe membre, wiþ a knyf hot brennynge, but ȝif þat a synwe oþere a Veyne
latte. And þou schalt remywe þe bon, þat is corupe on þis manere: unwrey
al þe bon, in kuttynge awey al þe flesch,—þe bon þat is corupte with an
yren, oþer wiþ a medicyne þat schal be seyde in þe laste ende of þis
boke. Oþer ellys it is


      

bettere to don it awey with hot yren & whanne þat þe bon þat is corupte
is vnkeueryde, schaue yt noȝt as many men don, but touche harde þilke
bon with hot yren & afterewarde helde on þilke bon hot oyle of rosys, &
leye on one of þe mundyficatyfes þat beþ in þe antitodarye, whiche þat
wylle remywe þe rotyde bon withoute violence. Ffor vndirstond wel, þawȝ
þat þou clanse þe rotyde bon with schavynge oþere wiþ vylinge with
vyolence, neuere þe latere kynde wyl afterwarde don aweye a schelle of
þilke same bon, noȝt aȝenstondynge þy schauynge & þy raspynge; wherefore
in remefynge þilke bon, þou multiplyest þy trauell, & þou makyste no
mundificatioun to þe folle; & þerof may come ofte tymes, an yuele
festre. And inconuenient medycine ys amendyde, in consyderynge þe
complexioun  of alle þe bodye, & þe complexioun of þe lyme, &
þe gree of þe medycine; for ȝif þat þe membre be drye as þe erys,
noseþrylles & alle bony & grestly lemes, & þey han grete putrede &
roteschippe, þenne þou nedyste a ful drye medycyne; & ȝif þat þe body
oþere þe membre be naturellyche moist, ȝif þat he haue a lyte putrede
oþere roteschippe, þanne thou nedyste a medycine þat ys lyte dryinge.
And ȝif þat the body oþere þe lymes ben mene betwene fatnesse and
lenesse—þat nys neiþere to fatte ne to lene, þenne þou nedyst a medycine
þat is in kynde, mesurablyche dryinge.


      

And ȝif þat two membrys ben in complexioun i-lyche euene, & þe on haue
myche quyter & þe oþere lyte quyter, he þat haþ þe more quyter nedyth þe
dreyere medycine,——afterwarde it nediþ by mesure þat þou kepe naturel
þynge, with þynge þat is acordynge to þe same nature, and also to

eche olde holwe, vlcere,—may be knowe by þis manere: ȝif þat þe
medycine make þenne quyter & blody & make þe wounde holwere þan he
scholde be, þenne ys þe medycine to acute; & ȝif þe quyter be þikke &
towȝ, þenne ys þe medycine to lythye; and also an oþere  signe þat


      

þy medycine is to scharpe, þat þe place about þe wounde ys to grene,
blake, red oþere to ȝelwe & þe syke man felyþ to grete hete 
& brennynge, & also þe Venym of þe wounde multiplyeth, and whanne þe
vnkunnynge leche seþ þese Accidentes tofore seyde, he ordeyneþ a dryere
medycine; & so eche day þe wounde apeirith. And þe signe þat þe medycine
is of feble dreyinge is þat þe quyter & þe rotnesse, þat goþ out þere

is colde whyte oþer wan, oþer clere in coloure, oþer softe, & þe syke

 Cap. xii of þe þridde techynge of þe firste tretis is of a  festre.

ffestre  is a depe olde wounde and  þe mouth is streyt of hym & þe grounde is brod, & he haþ
wiþ ynne hym a callose hardnesse alle aboute, as yt were a gose penne
oþer ellys a kane, & a ffestre haþ  diffence from a depe
Vlcus & a cauernose; for a depe Vlcus & a Cauernose, of whom yt ys tolde
in þe chapitle toforeseyde, þowȝ þat þey acorden togedire in depnesse &
in streytnesse of þe mouþ, þe Vlcus haþ noȝt wiþyn hym a callose
hardnesse, wherefore a festre may noȝt be clensyde with wasschynges,
with þe whiche a  cavernose Vlcus may be clansyde, but
it is necessarye, aftere þat


      

þou hast y-wasschyde yt, to remeffyn þilke callose hardnesse with a
cauterye, oþere wiþ a medycine cauterysynge þat ys brennynge, þe whiche
cauterye oþer brennynge scholde make þe depþe of þe Vlcus holwere þanne
he was. Wherefore it is necessarie to a surgiene to knowe þe difference
of þis scyence, þat he mowe conne hele boþe þe Vlcus & þe festre with
medycines different þat longyth to hem boþe. And ȝif þat a festre be in
þe flesch, oþer ellys bytwene synwe & synwe, so þat þe Substaunce of þe
synwe be noȝt corupte ne þe bon, yt nys non nede to take non oþere

sagytelle, & leye a sagitelle leff aboue, and þis medycine þou schalt

ȝif þat þe callosite be noȝt to hard. In þese tweye cases þe medycyne of
egremoyne ne suffiseþ noȝt, but it ys necessarye a kauterye of fyre oþer
a medycine caustyke; & of þese medycins þou schalt han a ful techynge,
folwynge in þe boke. And ȝif þat þe bon were corupte in þe depþe of þe

 Cap. xiii off þe þridde techynge off þe ffirste tretys is Off a Canker.

 Cankyre y-woundyde comyth of opnynge, oþere of kuttynge, oþere of

chaungyth þe Ulcus into a Cankere. And þese beþ þe toknys of þe cankere:
þe Ulcus ys foule & stynkynge, þe lippes beþ grete, wanne, oþere blake,
harde, and wiþinne kernelly, & ouere alle aboute areryde & holwy, & þis
is þe dyfference bytwene cancre & a foule Ulcus & an hory, of whom y
haue made mensioun aboue, þat ȝif þat þou wassche hem boþe 
wiþ leyȝe, þe cancre schal ben pale & foulere þenne he was tofore, &
þere schal fallen out of hym pecys, gobetmele. And þe Ulcus ys y-
clansede with þilke leyȝe, & þe flesch ys made fayrere þenne yt was
tofore, ne þe Ulcus stynkeþ noȝt by þe same stenche as þe cancre doþ;
for þe cankre hath a propre saffoure, þe which may noȝt be wryten wiþ

han seye cankrys. A  generall rule in þe cure of cankre ys,
þat a cankyre may noȝt ben helyde bot ȝif þat he be done awey wiþ alle

—but he be in place, þere he may al be don away; ffor þe more þat þou
touchiste hym with a vyolent thynge oþer medycine, þe more hys malys is

ofte as þou wylt wiþ surgerye helyn a cancre: furst evacue þe
malencolyent matere, ffor þat is ypocras techynge, & ȝif he be growen in
swyche a place, þere as he may noȝt be done alle aweye, as in þe nekke

ȝif þat he be noȝt ful of elde humorys; whiche þat nedyth to curynge of

 Cap. XV. off the þridde techynge of þe ffirste tretys is off a
Crawmpe, that comyth to a Wounde.

Necessarye thynge ys a surgyne, to knowe þe causys of þe crampe whiche
þat comyth to a wounde þat scholde ben y-helyde, and also þat he knowe
þe dysposicioun of hym þat haþ þe crampe. And also what þynge þe crampe
ys, þat he mowe resonablyche hele þe crampe. The crampe ys a seknesse
cordouse, oþere ellys nervose, in the whiche syknesse þe cordes & þe
synwes were drawyne to here bygynnynge; of þe whiche drawynge þere beþ
tweye causes


      

conjuncte: þe on ys repletion of þe synwe, oþere of þe corde, þe oþere
is Inanysion. He þat ys in  avision ofte tymes haþ a
cause goynge to fore,  as to myche evacuacioun of blod, oþere
of sum othire thynge; as to longe afflictioun for longe akþe, oþere
ellys, for þe Apetite of the syke man hath be longe tyme enffeblyde; &
þis comyth lytel & lytell, and þe crampe þat comyth of boþe þese causys
may noȝt ben helyde. And he þat comyth of repletion hath on of þre
causys goynge tofore: þe firste cause ys to grete akþe, þe secunde cause
ys colde, þe þridde ys putrefaccioun oþer rotynge; and þowȝ þat one
sengle cause sumtyme suffiseth to maken a crampe, ofte tymes alle þese
causes happe to come togedres. And þis crampe may ben y-helyde ere þat
he be comfermyde, & after þat he ys confermyde selden oþere neffere. A
surgyne moste þenne be busye; in alle þat he myȝte, þat a crampe no wexe
noȝt in þe wounde þat scholde be helyde, wiþ obuiacion dyffendynge þat
none of þe þre causes tofore seyde ne come noȝte to þe wounde; þe one ys
in deffendynge þe lyme from putrefaccioun, þe oþere is in kepynge þe
lyme from rotenesse, þe þridde is to gouerne hym from gret akynge; ffor
it is more sykere to dyffende, þat a crampe ne come noȝt, þenne aftere
þat he ys come with medycine þat is doutes oþere dredful to


      

don aweye, Ffor ȝif þat a ffeuyre come to an hed oþere to a synwe þat ys
y-woundyde, & þe crampe folwe euyre more, yt ys dedlyche. Take hede
þenne to aswage þe akþe with anoyngtynge of oyle of rosys, and in doynge
as y haue seyde tofore in þe chapitle of synwes þat beþ y-woundyde; ffor
ofte tymes þe crampe comyth for woundys, þat beþ made in þe hed oþere
ellis  in þe synwe: And ȝif þat akþe were so grete,
þat makyth a crampe for þe prikynge off a synwe oþer ellys of a corde,
and ȝif þou myȝtest noȝt deffende þe crampe, newhere wiþ blode letynge,
ne wiþ ventosynge, ne wiþ clysterye, ne wiþ suppositorye, ne with
defensif in anoyntynge þe nekke, ne þe grynde, ne þe arme holys, þenne
yt is necessarie þat þou kytte alle atwo þilke synwe oþere corde þat is
y-prikyde, þowȝ þat þe ffelynge oþere þe meffynge of þe lyme, to whom
þilke synwe oþere corde servyde, in party oþer in al be loste. Ffor yt
is bettyre  þat a man lese þe felynge & þe meffynge of a lyme
þenne þawȝ þat he deyȝe. But yt is bettyre ȝif þat þou couþest kepen a
man with oþere manere medycines, þenne þat þe synwe oþere corde be y-
kutte al atwo. And ȝif þat þou were noȝt at þe bygynninge, and þou
fyndest a man hauynge a crampe for a wounde, do þou as y dyde at Melan.
Þere was a Scolere of myne þat was a Surgyne þat was y-clepyde Olyfere,
whyche þat


      

curyde a schepere of a wounde þat he hadde in the hed; & by þilke wounde
þe pannycle oþere þe skyn þat keueryth þe breyne panne, þat is vndire þe
fflesch, was y-hurt, & nere þe latere þe breyn panne was noȝt y-hurt. &
þilke leche, ere þanne he hadde perfytlyche y-puryfiede þylke pannycle,
soudyde þe wounde withouten forth; & whanne þat þilke wounde was y-
sowdyde, þe pannycle þat was noȝt wel helyde hadde a dedeyne, & was
cause of engendrynge of a crampe in þilke wounde. And at þe laste y was
clepyde to þilke syke man, & y fonde hym habbynge þe crampe, & with þe
crampe he hadde manye smale enpostemes aboute hys face, & þat ys an
yuele tokne in þe woundys of þe hed, and þenne y demyde hym for ded.
Naþeles at þe instaunce of hys frendys y þat wolde assaye þe worchynge
of kynde vpon resoun, I made hys hed ben y-schaue, and y kutte aȝeyne þe
wounde, þat was consoudid, with a rasoure to þe depþe of þe same wounde,
& afterewarde y fulfylde þilke wounde with hote oyle of rosys, & y
anoyntede alle þe hed with þe same oyle of roses & a lytell vynegre y-
medlyde togedre, & y anoyntede þe nolle & þe nekke onlye wiþ oyle of
rosys, and y dyde on þe wounde þe ȝolke of an eye with oyle of rosys,
and y bonde alle þe hed wiþ a


      

bonde leggynge þere undyre hurdys oþere towȝ smal tosyde, and y opnyde
hys mouth & put into hys mouth þe broth of a chyken y-made with comyn,
and also clere wyn y-medlyde with myche watyre. On þe morwe y turnyde
aȝeyne & y fonde þe syke of bettyre dysposicioun, & he opnyde bettyre
hys mouth, & he spak bettyre; & naþeles  y fonde þe wounde
drye, & þenne y dede efte sonys þe same medycine & þe same vncture. In
þe þridde day þe skyn of þe hed was y-mad moyst, whyche þat was to forne
as drye as a skyn hadde be rostyde to þe fyre, and in so myche þe skyn
was y-made þunne, þat þere was noþynge betwene þe skyn & þe breyne
panne. & at þe laste þe wounde quyteryde wiþ contynewaunce of þe same
cure tofore seyde, & in þis manere þe ȝonge man was helyde boþe of þe
crampe & eke of þe wounde. But þilke crampe was withouten ffeuyre; ffor
y ne may noȝt þynke þat y haue seyn  a ffevyre in þe woundes of synwes, oþere ellys of þe hed precede
a crampe, þat noȝt aȝeyne stondynge remedye  oþere medycynes þe pacient
þat hadde þe crampe ne deyede. My beste conseyle is to letyn hym blod in
the bygynninge þat haþ þe crampe, namly, & he be stronge & replete, and
ȝif þat he haue nouȝt bled ynowȝ at hys wounde; and anoynte hys nolle &
hys nekke wiþ hote oynementys, as with oyle of


      

nardyne, enforbine, Oyle rewe, lylyes &c.;, and also to make smale
cauteryes punctales, þat is to sigge as smale as þe ende of a prykke,
bytwene euery whirlebone of þe nekke, so neuere þe latere þat þe

leye hym in a softe bed, & lete hym ben in reste & in pees. But þere be
summe þat setten in here bokys medycines, þat provocen þe ffeuerys; ffor

Special signes maken one of pre manere of crampes: þe on ys y-clepyde
Emprostonos, þe oþere Empistonos, þe þridde tetanus. In þese manere of
crampe þat is clepyde Emprostonos þe synwes tofore be drawen togedire,
þe fore party of þe hed ys crokyde, ne þe syke man ne may noȝt heffyn it
vp, he berith hys chyn as yt leye on hys brest; hys mouþ is streyte, ne
he ne may noȝt opyne yt, and þe ffyngres of hys hande ben foldyde into
hys fust. And in Empistonos þe nekke ys crokyde, his mouþ is opyne, his
chekes beþ opyne, & þe fyngres of hys handys ben streynde bakwarde, and
þe tetane halt boþe þe partye of þe body, so þat he may nouȝt turne hys
nekke to non partie, but alle þe body is styffe & streynde, as a staf
were put in at hys hed & out at his ers. Alle þese toknys oþere ellys
sum of hem schewith þe disposicioun of hym þat haþ þe crampe. And whanne
þat þese toknys fallyn in þe wounde of an hed oþere ellys of  a synwe, þey teche bettire þe leche to fle from þe syke man,
þenne on hym to abyde & cure. The firste


      

tretys ys y-endyde wiþ helpe of almyȝtie god, now with þe helpe of  þe same y go to þe secunde.


           Now begynneþ þe secunde tretys off particuler woundes of
          membris of office from þe hede to þe ffot, and ffirste y
          begynne at the Anotamye off the hed.

Al thynge breffliche y-ordeynde, aftere þe devysinge of my Symple wytt,
whiche þat longith to þe firste tretys of this  boke whiche
þat holdyth certeyne rulys & techynges off surgerye vndire general
chapitelis, as we han byheyȝt. Now we wylle begynne to tretyn of
certeyne cures, aftere þat þe lymes ben in mannys body. & firste y wyl
begynne at þe hed & at hys anotamye, & so þe processe forþ to eueryche
membre devysinge þe Anotamye of euery membre, & in ordeynynge þe cures
of woundys þat beþ made in eche sengle membre, I sigge þat þe hed ys
made of þre partyes: of a ffleschy party, a bony partye, and a braynie
partye. Þe fflesch partye is aboue þe brayn panne, whiche þat is made of
an herye skyn; & þilke skyn ys fulfylde with brawnys in euery place. Þe


      

herys off þe hed were for grete proffyte y-ordeynde, þat neiþere colde
ne hete ne scholde noȝt sodeynliche entre þe pores of þe skyn, & neuere
þe lattere þat þe fumosyte of þe hed myȝte go out be þe pores þere as þe
here growyth, and þat þe hed myȝte be þe more semlykere, and þat þe
coloure of þe herys myȝte schewe þe complexioun of þe hed. Þe skyn þat
is abouen þe breyne panne ys lacertos & ful of þykke flesch, þat he
myȝte wreyen þe breyn panne, þat he scholde noȝt fele to sodeynlyche
neiþere to grete hete ne to cold. Þe whiche skyn ys made of sotyll
þredys of synwes þat comeþ from þe brayn & of veynis & of arteryes
sotylliche y-mad; and so þe skyn of þe hed ys sotylliche y-Ioyned with
þe skyn off alle þe bodye, and also þe skyn of þe hed ys more þykkere
þenne þe brayne scolle, þat it scholde be more rare & more porose þat is
to sigge more ful of holys. Þe lacertes of þe skyn proceden after þat þe
goynge procedyth of þe herys, þe brayn panne ys mad of manye bonys. Þe
fyrste summe, whiche þat wiþholdyth þe profites þat longyth to þe brayn
panne, haþ tweye helpynges; on helpynge ys, þowȝ þat an hurtynge come to
on bon, neuere þe latere he scholde noȝt fallen to alle þe bonys; þe
secunde helpe is þat on bon þat is to harde in on partye, ne scholde
noȝt be so  hard in an oþere


      

partye. Secunde summe, whiche þat withhalt helpynges, þat beþ vnder þe
brayn panne, haþ with hym iiij helpynges; þe whiche helpynges beþ ful
mad be þe semys þat beþ of þe breyn panne. Ne þo helpynges ne myȝte noȝt
be mad, but ȝif þat þere were manye bonys. Þe firste helpe ys, þat þe
veynes myȝte go doun by the semys of  þe brayn panne,
berynge norosschynge to þe same brayn.

Secunde helpe ys þat þe synwes, þat comyth out of þe brayn, myȝte habbe
wey in goynge out. Þe þridde helpe ys, þat þe fumes of þe brayn myȝte
habbe wey of smokynge out. Þe ffourþe ys, þat neiþere dura mater ne pia
mater, þere as þey ben y-hongyde, ne myȝte noȝt greue þe brayn. Sytthe
þat þe breyne panne ys made of two smeþe lyȝte tablys, þat one ys aboue
& þe oþere byneþe, & þey be sumwhat spongyouse in þe myddel & rare, þat
þe smokys of þe hed myȝte þe bettyre passen out, & þey be smeþe þat þey
myȝte noȝt greue þe brayn. Dyuerse men þat makyth dyuerse Anotamye
devydeþ þe breyn panne dyuerslyche. Somme nowmbryth mo bonys. þenne
summe oþere spekyn of; but soþenesse ys that þere ben sixe; & one whyche
þat susteyneþ þo sixe. Þe ffyrste bon ys clepyde þe bon of þe  fforhed oþere ellys coronale, & he bygynneþ from þe browys, &
lastyth vnto þe seme þat departyth þe hed


      

twarte offere. And þylke bon is y-clepyde coronale: þis bon hath in some
manere of men a smal seme in þe ffoldynge of þe fforhed, & þere fore sum
men siggeþ þat þere beþ tweye bonys. Tweye oþere bonys beþ y-Ioyned wiþ
þylke bon coronale in þe myden of þe hed twarte offere, & þey ben y-
bounde togedyre by one Iucture, þe whiche þat strecchiþ from tofore to
byhynde, by the lengthe of þe hed, þe whiche ys y-clepyde sagyttalis by
as myche as he ys schapyde lyke an arwe. And þese tweye bonys beþ y-
clepyde Nerualia, by cause of þe ffigure of the seme þat ys wiþ þe
coronale,  ys þe ffigure of a synwe oþere of a corde. And
þese bonys ben in þe heyest coppe of the hed, and behynde in þe nolle
þere ys a bon whyche þat is y-clepyde Alauda, & ys y-made to þe
Symilitude of þis cyffre of Augrym


, whiche þat ys Ioynede with þe bonys nerualibus tofore seyde, by þe
mene of on ȝem y-mad to þe lyknesse of þe bon tofore seyde. & þese þre
ȝemes whiche þat Ioyneþ togedyre þe foure bonys to fore seyde, ben y-
made as yt were tweye  ȝawes, whos teth joyned eche of
hem in oþere in thys manere 

& þis ioyninge togedire of on bon with an oþer was y-made by-cause
Iuvamentes þat y haue tolde beforn; þere nys no bon y-ioynede with an
oþere as þese bonys ben. Undire þe bon þat ys


      

y-clepyde Alauda, þere ys a ful harde bon & y-holyde in þe myddle, þe
whyche bone susteyneth alle þe bonys of þe hed. Þe whiche bon ys y-
clepyde Passilus, & he ys ioynede byneþe wiþ þe fyrste bon of þe nekke.
Þe schappe of þe coniuccioun of þe fife bonys of þe hed ys in þis manere


. Bothe on þe ryȝte syde & on þe lefte syde of þe forseyde bonys whiche
þat beþ y-clepyde nerualia, whiche þat beþ in lengthe in þe heyest
place of þe hed, þere ben twey bonys on eiþere syde; þe whiche þat beþ
vndiresetterys to þo bonys þat beþ y-clepyde nerualia; & þo bonys þat
vndire setten, ben y-clept ossa mendosa. And þese bonys in one partye
ben ful harde, þere as þe hole of þe ere passyth þorwȝ, & þey ben y-
clepede  petrosa & sum men siggen þat þere ben foure
bonys, two on eythere syde. & whanne þat alle bonys of þe hed be Ioynede
togedire þou schalt fynde in sotfastnesse, þat þere ben but sixe bonys
whanne þat þou reknyste os  coronale ffor on bon, & tweye bonys
þat beþ y-clepyde mendose tweyne þat beþ þre, and o bon þat ys y-clepyde
Alanda, & tweye bonys þat is y-clepyde nerualia—þat beþ sixe, and þe vij
bon ys y-clepyde passillare, þe whiche ys nought of þe bonys of þe hed,
but he susteyneth alle þe oþere bonys of þe hed. And þre maner of semys
makyth coniuccioun of alle þe bonys on þis


      

manere


, & with tweye semys mendose in þis manere

. And whanne þat þe corone of þe hed ys perfyt, þe hed  ys
mad in þis manere

. Þis ys þe forme of an hed wel proporcionede, þat he be ronde because
þat he myghte þe more withholde, & þat he myȝte þe lasse be y-hurt, and
þat he be longewarped havynge tofore & behynde eminence þat is to sigge
aperynge, þat þe synwes þat comyth out of þe brayn, myghte haue a porose
place of goynge out. And naþelese as ypocras & galyen, whiche þat
exponeþ ypocras, tellyn: it is possible to fynden þre oþere manere
makynge of hedys. On manere is, ȝif eminence be noȝt in þe partye of þe
hed tofore; for ȝif þat he be pleyn in þe partye tofore, by þat
pleynnesse þe seme is y-lost þat is y-clepyde coronalis. Secunde ys ȝif
þe hed haff non eminence behynde, but þat þe hyndore party be playn, and
by þat playnnesse þe seme ys y-lost þat ys y-clepyde Alauda.  Þe þridde ys ȝif þere be non eminence tofore ne behynde in þe
hed, but alle þe hed ys rounde as a cercle. And þenne þere nys but on
sem in þe myddel of þe breyn panne, ffor it is vnpossible þe hed to
habben enye oþere schappe wiþouten lesyng of some party of þe brayn; &
þat were contrariouse aȝeyne lyf. By þe myddele seme, whiche þat is in
þe hed, þere dissendyth a veyne comynge


      

from þe lyffere, by þe breyn ponne, of a bon whiche þat is y-holyde. þat
is y-clepyde pasillaris. And by þe same weye þere arysith an Arterye
comynge fro þe herte, and þey ben Ioynde togedire, & of þe weffynge of
þo tweyne þere is y-mad an hard pannycle þat is to sigge a cloth þat is
vndir þe brayn panne, and he is hongyde wiþ sum smale ligamentys to þe
brayn panne in some of þe semys, þe whych pannycle byndeþ þe bonys
togedire, & it is clepyde dura mater. And yt is ryȝtful þat an Arterye
scholde arysen vpwarde from byneþyne, for þe blod þat ys in hym þat is
sotyll, & hys meffynge þat ys pulsatyff  ; and he hadde
discendyde from aboue dunwarde, he scholde han discendyde wiþ to gret
 an hastynesse, but þe ascendynge temprith þulke fflux. And
yt is couenable þat þe veyne discende, bycause þat þe blod þat ys in þe
veynes ys more þykkore, & þe blod þat is in þe veyne geþ doun softliche.
& boþe þese veynes þat buþ  pulsatyf & nouȝt pulsatyf
beþ y-Ioynede wiþ dura matre. And also þowȝ þe veyne streche more
lowere, & of hem ys engendryde pia mater. Afterward þey descenden doun
to þe brayn. & þey bryngen lyf & dywe norysschynge & cordyal spirites,
þe whiche is in þe brayn and þere is diffyede, & þere resseyueþ naturel
forme of vnderstondynge. Pia mater environeþ al þe brayn, & departyth
hym into þe þre celoles  þat beþ chaumbres:


      

þe firste, þe myddle, & þe laste. And þowȝ þat alle þese ben diffyede
senglerlyche by hem selffyn, yt semeþ þat þe celele þat is tofore in þe
brayn ys departyde in two parties, & by þat cause sum men siggen, þat
þere ben foure ventricles of þe brayn. Þe furþere part of þe brayn ys
gret & brod, by cause þat he scholde resseyue manye spirites þat ben y-
sende to hym for þat place is propre instrement of y-maginacion, þe
whiche resceyueþ þynges þat buþ comprehendide of fantasie; and þo þynges
comen vndirstondynge resceyueþ by propre Instrementys þat longyth to
hym, and þawȝ þat al þe brayn, in comparson of þe herte & of alle oþere
membres of þe body, be y-demyde colde & moist, þis celule hauynge
comparson to oþere celules ys y-demyde hot & dryȝe. Þe myddel part of þe
brayn ys lasse þen eny of þe oþere two partyes, & here forme ys pyneat,
brod towarde þe furþere syde of þe hed and scharpere towarde þe hyndor
syde, þat he myȝte be þe more able to resceyue y-maginatyf þynges & þo
þynges to ȝefe to þe ynnere partye & þo þynges þat beþ y-ȝefe to with
holde. Þis ventricle ys y-sette bytwene tweyne additamentes of þe brayn,
þe whiche additamentes ben y-liche þe two buttokkes of a man þat beþ y-
Ioynede togedre, and þey beþ to þis ventricle as yt were a syttynge place


      

oþere a couche, vpon . þe whyche he ys drawyne abrode, whenne þat he
resseyueþ  y-maginatyff þynges. And afterwarde he ys y-drawe
togedire as a worme, whenne þat he resceyueth y-maginatyff þynges; and
whenne þat þe sentence of þilke y-magynacioun ys y-brought forth, þenne
þilke ventricle ys y-drawe alonge. And also þe smallere ende of þis
ventricle entrith into þe ventricle þat ys behynde in þe hed, and þis
ventricle ys myche lasse þenne þe oþere tweyne bycause þat non synwes
procedent not out of hym, and þat manye þynges myghte be endyde in
litel place, þat vertue of wytt myghte þe sonnere be y-gedryde togedre
to taken hys counseyll. And thys ventrycle to comparson of oþere
ventricles ys y-demyde hot & drye. After þat ys þe hyndere ventricle,
whiche ys grattere & hardere þenne thys; þe whiche in comparson of þe
oþere tweyne ys y-demyde colde & drye, þe whiche is brod towarde þe fore
partye of þe hed & scharpe bachwarde, þe whyche resseyuyth sentense þat
beþ schewyde & kepyth hem priuyliche as a chest kepyth tresore. And out
of hym goth out  nucha  þrowe þe hole of þe bon þat ys y-clepyde passilarys. And
þilke nucha ys y-clothyde  wiþ tweye pannycles
þat goth out of þe brayn. And alle þe brayn ys y-demyde colde & moyst.
bycause þat he scholde


      

atempren spirituel ffumosites þat comyth of þe herte, and þat he scholde
noȝte ben y-dreyȝede fforto myche meffynge þat he haþ in worchynge of
vertues. And þe brayn is whit bycause þat scholde resceyue þe bettere
resoun & vnderstondynge. Ffor þese peyntores, whenne þey schulle peynten
a table, firste þey maken yt whyte, for þere nylle none coloure lasten
but yt be leyde vpon whyt; & it is þenne oþere rare, because þat
vndirstondynge myȝte þe sonnere passe þorwe hym; & yt is nessche þat þe
meffynges off vertues myghte þe betyre habbe place; & þe brayn ys towȝ,
þat þe synwes þat goth out of hym, myȝte be þe  more towȝere,
and þe more þat þey ben enlongyde from here bygynninge, þe more hardere
þey scholde be; and also that þey scholde be bowable y-nowȝ nought
aȝeynestondynge here hardnesse. And yt is necessarye þat þe brayn
scholde be cloþed with tweye clothys, þat in hys meffynge as y haue
seyde tofore he scholde nought ben y-hurt of þe brayn panne.

Also þe brayn ys departyde into þre celules with þe additamentes of þe
pannycles of pie  matris, þat þe spirites myȝt þe
lengore dwellen in þe ventricles, to reseyfen by ordre, digestioun,
forme & perfeccion, more þanne þey hadden fyrst of þe hert, and þat
euery vertue myghte fulfylle hys accioun in hys ventrycle, ere


      

þanne þe foys þat ys comprehendyde myghte passe to þe ventricle þat ys
sywynge. Nowȝt aȝeynestondynge þese propretes, þe brayn haþ sum
substaunce of marie whiche fulfilleþ þe voydenesses of þe forseyde
pannycleres. And þilke marye envyrownyth þe foreseyde pannycles, of þe
whyche marye þere may sum partye in þe hurtynge of þe hed ben y-lost;
and noȝt ageynestondynge þe goynge out of sum partye of þilke marye, a
man schal noȝt deye. Ffor þis marye is nought of þe substaunce of þe
ventricles of þe brayn, of whiche mynde ys y-mad; ffor þey ben of so
grete noblete, ȝif þere be neuere so litel infectioun oþere ellys þat
þere falle neuere so lytel a lesynge of hem, þey ben depreffyde of alle
here helthe, in so myche þat on celele may noȝt ben y-lost, and a man
ben saffyde, as manye ydyotes supposen. Anothomye of eynen, neose, erne,
chekelappes, mouþ, tonge & teþ, we deferren to ordeynen in þe þridde
tretys, in þe distyncioun whiche ȝif god wol, we þynkeþ forto treten of
oþere syknesse of þe lymes, outsepte woundes. And þo hurtynges þat beþ
y-mad in þe hed, oþere þey ben mad withouten wounde, oþere with wounde.
& wheþere þat it be wyth wounde oþere wiþouten wounde, oþere þey ben
with brekynge of þe brayn panne, oþere


      

without brekynge of þe breyn panne. And wheþer  þat yt be mad
wiþ þe breche of þe brayn panne oþere withouten breche of þe breyn
panne, some ben with hurtynge of þe brayn, some without hurtynge of þe
brayn. And ryȝte as þilke hurtynges habben dyfference in toknes, so þey
hauen differens in pereles & pronosticaciouns & maners, with þe whiche
þey most ben y-holpen. And ȝif an hurt be in þe hed withouten wounde, as
with fallynge, oþere with smytinge of a ston, oþere a staff, oþere with
sum oþere thynge þat brusyth, and ȝif þat yt be withouten breche of þe
brayn panne, & with outen hurtynge of þe brayn panne, it nedyth nouȝt
but schaffynge of þe hed, & anoyntynge wiþ hote oyle of roses, and
abofen þe vncture to strawyn on þe poudre of þe seed of myrtylles, &
streyne þe place with a band tyl al þe place be y-fastnyde & þe

& he schal ben y-curyd ryȝt as oþere empostemys þat beþ y-woundyde. And
ȝif þat þe brayn panne were y-broke withoute enye wounde of þe hed, þe
whiche may ben y-knowe by dysposicioun of þe cause & eke of þe syke man,
in byholdynge ȝif þat þat smyt

oþere ellys þat he was y-smyte with stronge smytynge; and also ȝif þat

of a Kubyte; and þou schalt harpe so ofte tymes, & ȝif þat þe pacient
mowe susteyne þe soun, he haþ noȝt hys brayn panne y-broke; ffor ȝif hys
breyn panne were broke, þe seke man myghte nought susteyne þe soun of þe

panne is broken. And to þe


      

laste signes beþ more serteyne þenne enye of þe oþere. And vnderstonde
þat þe breyn panne may ofte tymes ben to-broke, & naþeles þe brayn
felyth nought in þe bygynninge none hurtynge. But afterwardys ofte tyme
of hurtynge of þe brayn panne þe brayn ys y-hurt, Galien wytnessynge;
the brekynge of þe bonys of þe hed ys dyuers in perelys from brekyng of
oþer bonys of þe body, for þe accidentes whiche þat fallyth ofte tymes
to þe breche of þe brayn panne. Ne þere nys no man, ne neuere ne was,
þat myȝte euyre more helpen to alle accidentes whenne þat þe brayn was

whiche þat comyth to þe accidentes of þe brayn & of hys pannycle, ben
alwey dwellynge: as constipacioun of þe wombe, oþere ellys flux of þe
wombe, oþere ellys crokydnesse, oþere ellys lokynge a-squynte of þe
eyȝen, oþere ellys wepynge of þat on eyȝe, oþere ellys an hard scotomye,
oþere ellys ffebylnesse of alle þe vertues & chaungynge. And noȝt only
anymal vertues, þat beþ vertewys of þe brayn, beþ noȝt y-chaungyde, but
also naturell vertewys, & lyfy vertewys sensyble & motifes; sensible,
for þat þey seen noȝt


      

also priuye vertues ben y-trublyde as ymagenatyff, ffor þey

a rigoor goth tofore. A rigoor nys nothynge ellys but as yt were a
prikynge of nedlys oþere of nettlys in þe flesch, and ȝif þis rigoor

and ȝif the crampe folwen, yt ys dedlye. Also þese beþ yuele accidentes:
blaknesse of þe tonge, bleynesse  aboute þe chyn oþere þe

an yuele signe, and sum tyme blod comyth out at þe erys & noseþrylles.
And ȝif þe more partye of þese toknys, oþere ellys alle comen, þe syke

charge yt noȝt litel but take þere of gode hede, & do in þe wounde hot

& kepe þilke wounde, as þou woldiste kepen oþer wondys of þe brayn panne
& of þe brayn, fro colde & from hete; ffor colde ys most greuest to
bonys & to pannycles þat beþ woundyde.  Þere ben some manere
of men þat leggen withouten forth on alle manere wondys of þe hed,
wheþere it be wiþ wounde of þe brayn panne oþere without wounde of þe
brayn panne, in what manere þat þe hed ben y-hurt, a lynnen cloth y-wett
in þe oignement y-made in þis manere: ℞ whit resine . ., oyle of roses  v., whyt wex  iij., þey melten all
togedres in an erthyne panne, & þey maken þere of on body, & þey boyllen
yt afterward in gode wyn by þe space of an Oure; & þey leten afterwarde
nyȝh colden, & þey weten þere ynne a pece of lynnen cloth, & þey schapen
þilke pece with a schere aftere þe wounde ys, & þey baþen þylke pece in
gode wyn, & þey leggen þilke pece on þe wounde, and anon afterwarde þey
leggen on þilke pece on eiþere syde of þe wounde a plumacyole, y-wet in
good hote wyn, & þey leggen on a drye pylwe of herdes vpon þo tweye wete
pylwes, þe whiche dreye pylwe schall comprehende þe tweye wete & bynden
hem faste; and þey ȝeuen some men to drynken gode


      

wyn, & to eten gode fflessch of capouns & of hennys; & þey comaunden to
drynken a drope watere; and þey gouernen on þis manere alle men þat ben
woundyde in þe hed differentlyche, & þey sigge þat mo  men ben
y-helyde by þis manere cure þen dyȝen. But by as myche as alle auttorys
beþ aȝeyns þis cure, namlyche in dyetynge, y ne was neuere hardye to
preuen þis manere of cure; ffor in mannys bodye a medycine schal nouȝt
ben preuyde, whiche þat is noȝt acordynge to resoun; ffor alle auctores
acorden, þat þere ys noþynge þat so sone greuyth þe brayn & þe synwes as
wyn doþ, and vsynge of flesch ys cause of bryngynge in an hot Emposteme.
Neuere þe latere ȝif a man þat vsith of custome swyche a manere dyetynge
haffe a stronge hed, & in hys hele he dredyth non wyn, & þe vertue of
hym þat ys seek  be stronge, in some manere of folk with þis
manere of gouernaylle vertue ys more y-streynþed, & sunnere þey ben y-
helyde. But y ne procede nouȝt wiþ swyche a manere dyetynge, by cause of
drede leste an hote empostome scholde come to þe sore; but y procede in
dyetynge & worche aboute þe wounde, as y haue seyde toforn. Oþere men
loken in brekynges of þe brayn panne, wheþer þat þe brekynge of þe
breyne panne be with a gret wounde oþere a smal wounde, oþere without
wounde; and ȝif


      

þat þere ben a gret wounde þey loken wheþere þey mowe seen ȝif enye pece
of þe brayn panne ben to-broken, & þey don yt awey. And afterwarde þey
putten bytwene þe brayn panne & duram matrem a þenne clout y-wett in þe
whyte of an eyȝe, & sumwhat þe whyte compressyde out, & þey fulfyllen
alle þe wounde of þe brayn panne with swiche a manere cloth. & þey
leggen in þe ofere wounde whiche þat ys in þe flesch, lenyt y-wett in þe
whyte of an eyȝe, tyl þat þe blode be staunchyde; & þey leggen aboue a
plumacyole y-wet in an eyȝe. And whanne þat þe blode ys y-staunchyde,
þey leggen a dreye cloth vndire þe brayn panne in þe wounde, and þey
leggen aboue þe wounde a potage, the whiche engendryth quytere; & whenne
þat þe quyter ys engendryde, þey leggen in þe wounde carp oþere lyneth
of a clout; and þey anoynt  aboute þe wounde
with oygnement fusco; and at þe laste ende þey leggen aboue Apostolicon.
And þey assayen in þis manere: ȝif þat þe brekynge of þe brayn panne be
with a rimele, þat ys to seye a chyne, oþere a creueys; & ȝif þat þilke
creveys perse to wiþynne, makynge þe syke man to streynen hys mouþ & hys
nese, & þey


      

maken hym þenne to blowen, & þey loken ȝif enye þynge exale out by þilke
rymele. & ȝif þat enye þynge exale out by þylke rymele, as blod ore
enye oþere matere, þey drede noȝt to perce þilke rymele; and þenne some
sigge þat þilke rymele scholde be to-broke oþere y-perced. from þat one
ende to þat oþere with Rynspyndles, persynge þe braynscolle. 
A rynspyndell ys an Instrument þat Cutlers poudren wiþ here hefftes,
whose ffigure schal be schappyde  in þe same chapitle ffolwynge. And þe worste þynge þat
a man may do, ys to perce þe rymele on boþe sydes. But oþere men don
bettyre whiche þat percen þe rymele at þat one ende, whyche is moste
hongynge; and þey maken as many holys on bysyde an oþere, as beþ
necessarie to maken an hole in þe brayn panne, be þe whiche hole ȝif
enye þynge beþ  fallen vpon þe duram matrem myȝte ben y-
clansyde; & þese in as myche as towchynge trepanacioun worchith best.
And whenne þat þey haue made manye holys, þey kutten from on hole to an
oþere with an spatymyne,  þat ys an Instrument,
þat þey mowe drawyne out þe bon, þat ys betwene þe ordre of holys þat
was y-made & þe rymele, & þey casten hym aweye, afterwarde


      

þey proceden forth in oþere manere thynges, as yt is seyde tofore. And
whenne þat þou desiriste þe wey of trepanynge, þis manere trepanynge
suffiseþ to þe in þe rimeles of þe brayn panne. Þis schal ben þe forme
of a trepane, with þe whiche þe brayn scolle schal be trepaned wiþ


. And þis is þe forme off a spatimene, with þe whiche a man schal kutte
with from on hole to an oþere hole

. And þou schalt smyten with a Mal oþere an hamere vpon þe gret ende;
and whenne þou haste remefed of þe bon þat schal be remeffyde, euene þe
brynkes wiþ schauynge, þat þere mowe noȝt lefe non manere scharpnesse in
þe brynkes. Þis ys þe manere of þy schafe

, and þis schafe schal kutten on þe syde þat feldyth inwarde, & schal be
blunt on þe syde þat ys outwarde. And þenne fulfyllen þe wounde þat is
in þe flesch, wiþoutforþ as y haue seyde tofore, with cloþ expressyde of
þe whyte of an eyȝe, & lynet to þat þe wounde be ful, and also tyl þat
þe kynde haue regeneryd a repeyrement, þe whiche schal fulfylle þe place
where þat þe bon was don awey.  Afterwarde þey cure þe wounde
aftere comyn cure of wondys. Alle oþere manere of trepanacioun ys
comprehendyde vndire on Somme, þowȝ þat sum men ordeynen partyklerliche
aftere here devyse, dyuerse maners. But be as myche as y haue noȝt seyne
in þis place no wey þat myȝte remefe


      

me fro doute, by as myche as y haue assayede longe tyme boþe by sum
auctores experyment, & also by myn experyment, & þat wey is noȝt
certeyn, þerefore here þey Galien, whiche þat seith: ȝif we mowe romywe
quyter without doynge awey bonys þat scholde be do awey, hyt is good.
And Auisene & Serapio acorden to þe same sentense of cure of hed-akþe,
þat comyth off smytinge oþere ellys of fallynge, where þat he techith þe
worchynge of hurtynges of þe brayn panne & of þe brayn, noȝt by
trepanacioun, but by emplastres & by medycines. And also y toke gode
hede þat manye mo men ben y-helyde by manere medycines & emplastres,
þenne ben y-helyde by trepanes þat beþ persynge oþere þryllynge. Ffor y
ne vse noȝt Instrumentes to remywe þe bon, but in tweye cases—þat on cas
ys ȝif þat þe breyn panne be so myche y-scleud, þat þe part þat ys y-
broke entre vndire þe partye þat ys hol, þe secunde cas ys ȝif þat enye
pece be departyde from þe brayn panne, whyche þat pryketh duram matrem.
In þe firste cas dura mater ys compressede. In þe secunde cas dura mater
ys y-prikyde, þe whiche ys cause of akþe, & akynge ys cause of drawynge
of humoures, the whiche engendrith a posteme vpon þe same pannycle, the
whiche is cause of a  crampe, & of oþere accidentes
tofore seyde, & at þe laste þey bryngen deþ


      

to þe pacient. In þese tweye causes y am constreynde to remefe a bon
with handly Instrumentes. In alle oþere manere of breches oþere of
crefeys, in what manere þat þey happen, þowȝ þat y be noȝt sykere of þe
paciente, naþeles y procede in þis manere with more trest, by sechynge
alweye help of god, þe whyche þat haþ y-helyde mo men  be myn handys, þat am hys Instrument, þenne han be ded, nouȝt
aȝeynestondynge al my cauteles &  helpynge. Ffor sytthe þat y
haf beholde sotelyche þe resouns & þe processes of oþere auctorys, y
holde þis wey lesse dredful þenne enye oþere. Ffor y folwe þe sentence
of galien, which þat seiþ: ȝif þat a man hath but o wey to hys hele, hyt
ys gode þat he holde þilke weye, þowȝ þat þilke wey be euell. And whenne
þat y come to a Man þat is woundyde in the hed, & knowe þat hys breyn
panne ys to-broke, by þe tokenys tofore seyde, ffirste y considere þe
vertu of hym þat ys pacient, & also hys age & alle oþer  partyclere thynge, & namly vertue. And gladliche y leue þe cure,
ȝif þat y se enye dedlye signes; but ȝif þat so be þat y be preyde wiþ
the grettere Instaunce of þe frendes of þe seke man. And noȝt
aȝeynestondynge here preyere, y telle hys frendys þat by resoun þe
pacient scholde


      

deyȝe, & þenne y wirche aboute hym, as y worche in a Man in whom yuel
accidentes apere. And ȝif þat þe signes be nought dedlyche, & þe breche
of þe breyn panne be with a gret wounde of þe hed, & þat a grete partye
of þe breyn panne be don aweye alle togedre, so þat y mowe han a gode
wey to legge medycynes vpon duram matrem. ffirste y do schaffe hys hed,
afterwarde y legge an olde lynnen clout & a þenne, y-wett in two partyes
of oyle of rosys swote smellynge, & on partye of mel rosat colat bytwene
þe duram matrem and þe brayn panne, slyȝlye & softlye, þat dura mater be
noȝt compressyde with þe cloth þat ys y-wett tofore seyde, & y fulfille
þe wounde of þe fflesch with lynt of olde lynnen cloþ wet in þe ȝolke of
an eyȝe & oyle of roses, of boþe y-lyche myche; & y anoynte aboute þe
wounde with deffensyfe of bol armonyak ofte tymes seyde, & y legge
abouen þe wounde a plumacyole whiche þat schal keuere alle þe wounde,
and þenne  abouen alle togedre y legge a grete plumacyole in-
wet in gode hot wyn. And afterewarde y bynde þe wounde with a bande, in
byndynge ofte tymes aboute þe hed, þat þe lynet & þe cloþ whyche þat is
in þe wounde & aboute þe wounde myȝte noȝt slyde to non partye, and y
bynde þe wounde in þat manere þat dura mater be no weye be compressyde. Þe


      

herys of þe hed schul be remywede awey on þis manere: clippe hem firste
with scherys, afterwarde take two partyes of colde water & on partye of
oyle of roses in somere, & make hot þe same watyr & þe oyle in wyntere &
wassche þe hed softliche, takynge hede þat non watere ne oyle entre into
þe wounde, & þenne schaffe yt with a rasoure. & whenne þat y haue
seruyde þe pacient on þis manere, y lete hym resten tyl on þe morwe; and
afterwarde y serfe þe wounde on þe same manere tyl þat þe wounde be hol.
Naþeles y consydere ȝif þat þe pacient be replet of blod, & hys vertue
be stronge; & ȝif þat he be ȝonge, & lytel blod haue nouȝt go out of hys
wounde, & whanne alle þese þynges acorde, y make hym to by leten blod on
þe coral veyne of þe arme; & but ȝif he mowe schiten, y helpe hym onys a
day, oþere wiþ suppositorye oþere wiþ clisterye; and y procede in
dyetynge as y haue seyde in þe chapytell of dyetynge. And whenne makyth
sufesentlyche quyter, y legge in þe wounde of þe brayn panne & vpon þe
brayn panne as y haue don toforn, & above þe wounde y legge a
mundyficatyff of mel rosat colat & barlye mele, tyl þat þe wounde ben y-
clansyde, & þat þe dura mater be y-soudyde wiþ þe breyn panne; & þenne y
caste in þe wounde of þe hed, poudre y-mad on þis manere: ℞ ffrank
Ensence, ciperi, þe


      

note of cypresse, sede of mirtylles, mirre ana. ȝ. i., oreby. ȝ. j., mak
poudre & leye þis poudre in þe wounde, & aboue þe poudre leye þe þredys
of lynne cloþ oþere ellys lynet; and aboffe al togedire y-legge an
entrete  y-made of two partyes of whyte resyn & on party of
wex y-molten togedre, & vpon stronge Vynegre, & y-colyd þorwe a þenne
streynoure vpon  colde water; & whenne þat þyne hondys ben
anoyntede with oyle of roses, & malaxe yt longe tyme togedyre. In somere
take euene porcioun of whyt resyn & of wex; in wyntere take foure
partyes of — & þe ffifte partye of wex, & y-drawe abrode þilke tret on
a cloþ & legge yt.on þe wounde, tyl þat he be perffitliche cycatrysede.
And ȝif þat þere were anye — of a bon. whiche þat prekyde duram matrem,
þenne y aforce me to remeffe þilke partye þat prykeþ with pynsones ȝif y
may. And ȝif þilke partye þat prikeþ ys y-ioynede so faste to þe hol bon
þat he nyl nouȝt be remeffyd awey, þenne y remeffe hym aweye wiþ
rugenynge. from þe partye þat halt, in makynge an hole, oþere two, oþere
mo, after þe quantyte of þe bon þat scholde be don awey, þat halt with
þe hole bon; & afterwarde y kutte with a spatymene from on hole


      

to anoþere tyl al þe bon be remeffyde aweye. And whenne þe bon ys
remefyde awey, y procede in þe cure, as yt is seyde in þis same
chapytell. But whanne þat y remeffe a bon with Instrumentes of þe brayn
panne, þenne y stoppe þe syke mannys eres, þat he mowe noȝt here þe sonn
of þe eyren þat trepanyth. And y remeffe þe same manere, þe partye þat
is broke, whiche þat goþ vndire þe partye þat ys hol, & compressyth þe
dura mater; and ȝif þat a gobbet oþere a pece of a bon helde sumwhat in
þe wounde, & myȝte noȝt lyȝtlye be remeffyde awey, and he prikyde nouȝt
ne compressyde nouȝt duram matrem, þenne at þe bygynninge y do on þe bon
hot oyle of rosys, and y fulfylle þe wounde with oyle of roses & þe
ȝolke of an eyȝe y-medled togedire, tyl þat þe bon be y-nesschyde, and
mowe lyȝtlyche be remywede aweye; þenne y remeffe þe bon, & y procede in
worchynge bytwene þe bon & duram matrem, as it is seyde tofore. & ȝif
þat þe breche of þe breyn panne  were as a cerfes, oþere
ellys y-sclend, & neiþere party of þe bon were lowere þenne oþere, þen y
consydere ȝif þilke sclendynge parten alle þe breyn panne, & þat þou
schalt y-knowe by þe toknys tofore seyde, oþere ellys þou schalt y-knowe
by þis signe þat neuere faileþ: make a plastre of þe poudre of mastyk & þe


      

whyte of an eyȝe, y-medlyde togedyre as þykke as hony, & distende it on
a cloþ, & leye it on þe place þat ys hurt from morwe tyl euene, oþere
ellys from euene tyl þe morwe. And whenne þat þe plastre ys remefyd
awey, ȝif þat þe crefeys persith þorwe þe breyn panne, þou schalt se þe
plastre more drye anonde  þe crefeys þen in enye oþer
place, for þe gret hete þat comyth from þe brayn; & ȝif þe breyn panne
be noȝt y-sclend þorwe, þe plastre schal be namore rye abouen þe
creffeys þenne on an oþere place. And ȝif þe crefeysd perse nouȝt þe
brayn scolle, þe cure is as yt is seyde in þe bygynnynge of þis
chapytell, þere as y tolde of þe cure of wounde of hed, where þat þe
breyn panne oþere þe brayn ys noȝt y-hurt. Ffor ȝif þat þilke ryemele
persyth þe breyn panne, þere ys a gret doute in þe cas, ffor some seyne
þat yt ys vnpossible swyche a wounde to ben y-helyde, but ȝif þe rymele
be y-trepanyd & þat a quantyte of þe bon be y-don awey, þat þe
superfluyte þat ys y-caste vpon duram matrem mowe be done awey, ellys þe
dura mater scholde putrefien & be corupt, & by þat skylle þe pacient
scholde deye, whiche þat myȝte be helyde by remywynge of þe bon. Naþeles
y þat haue y-seye in trepanynge grete peryle, namlyche whanne þat


      

þe crefeys ys bysyde þe semys, where þat trepanynge ys dedlyche, and y
haue seye manye þat wiþouten trepanynge almyȝtie god haþ delyuerede be

aftere þe doctryne tofore seyd, ffulfyllinge all þe  wounde
wiþ swyche manere clothys, & afterwarde y legge aboue þe ȝolke of an
eyȝe & oyle of roses y-medlyde togedres, and aboue þe wounde a defensiff
of bol armonyac tofore seyd, tyl þat þe quyter be engendryd. &
afterwarde y contynwe mel roses & oyle rosarum in þe wounde, & aboffe a
mundificatyf of mel rosarum & barly mele, tyl þat þe ligament be
fulliche engendrede on þe breyn panne, & þat þou schalt y-knowe whenne
þat þou seste þe bonys Ioynyde togedre, as yt were tweye bordys Ioynede

drye þredys of lynnen cloþ, and abouen a mundificatyf tyl þat þe bon be
keffride aboue. & þenne y strawe on aboue þe capytale poudre tofore

and abouen al þis y legge on a Tret of resyne; & y do alle þynges þat y

And ȝif me maken an obiectioun how þat yt myȝte withouten arerynge of þe
bon, þe blod & þe quyter be dreyede whiche þat fel doun by þilke
sclendynge vpon þe duram matrem, I answere: ryȝte as þe matere of þe
frenesie & þe matere of þe litargie þat is more doutes, by emplastres
withouten forth leyd is desolfed, and þere nys none sclyndynge of þe
breyn panne ne no wounde in þe skyn, myche more lyȝtlokere & more
bettere þe blod þat is lyȝt & able to ben reselfyde, whiche þat wende
done be þe forseyde sclendynge, may be þe forseyde sclendynge beter ben
exaled. Ne þilke blod ys noȝt inviscat in þe substaunce of dure matris
as þe matere ys in apostemys, wherfore he ys more obeyssaunt to þe
expulcioun of kynde, & also ys more obeyssaunt to the attractioun of
medycine. And ȝif þe brayn panne be hurte wiþout wounde of þe skyn, þe
whiche þou schalt y-knowen by þe toknys tofore seyde, þenne sum men
kutten aboue þe hurtyng in þe manere of a cros, & þey areryn þe foure
quarters, & þey kytten & flen þe pannycle þat keferith þe bonys, &
afterwardes þey vsen trepanys & here oþere comyn cures, as 
yt ys schewyde tofore. But y kytte noȝt þe skyn in manere of a cros, but
in þe manere of a Schelde oþere ellys of a thynge þat ys tryangle in þis
manere


, & y make but on quartere & y vnwreye þe bon, þat þe oyle of roses may
persen yn,


      

and þat þe vertue of þe medycine, þat ys y-mad of honye of roses & oyle

me by constantine oþere ellys by hym, þat seyth þat by alle oure myght
we enchewyn þat neþere oyle ne non vncomys  þynge falle noȝt withynne þe brayn-panne, I answere with
Avecene, þat seyth: þat he wircheþ ryȝtfulliche þat vsith certeyne
oyles, & þe same telliþ galien & serapion, and also y seye þat oyle of
roses, whiche þat be mad of grapes of Olyue tres þat beþ noȝt ripe, is
noȝt vnctuose, but is dreyȝe; & it is clepyde oyle Omfacinum, & namlye
whanne þat roses ben y-medlyde with þat oyle, þilke oyle hath y-gete to
hym a swete smellynge & a dreyȝinge, cumffortynge animal spirites; and
also þilke oyle hath a vertue expressif, as galien tellyth in the bok of
symple medycines, by þe whyche þe brayn ys conffortyde & akþes ben
aswagede, & ȝif þere be mad enye gret blod, yt is y-made Sotyll; &
whenne alle þese þynges ben y-gadryde togedyre & leyde abouen, dura

sum fallynge, oþere of sum smytynge withouten eny wounde ore enye


      

breche of eny bon, þan do þou as dyde y to a Chanoun of þe ordre of

had neuere seyne þe same cas, ne he ne couþe noȝt on lettre. And at þe
laste y was clepte, & y fonde hym noȝt herynge ne spekynge ne nothynge
mevynge, I demyde hym for ded, and naþeles sauyde, ȝif þat he were my
broþere y nolde nouȝt for an hundrede mark, but y sayede in hym þe
godnesse & þe helpynge of medycines; ffor ofte tymes kynde with gode
werkys helpith preueliche þat semyth vnpossible to a leche. And þenne
þey preyede me with gret Instaunce, and y made the herys of hys hed to
be schaffen and þenne y anoynt all þe hed with þre partye of oyle of
roses, & on partye of vyneger hot y-medlyde togedyre, & y caste abouen
þe poudre of mirtylles, and y leyde abouen a sotyll þenne cloth y-wet in
þe same oyle & vynegre,


      

& aboue þat towȝ smale y-tosyde, & y bonde alle þe hed with a band, &
abouen y leyde a lambys skyn, & so y chaungede yt twyes euerye day; in
anoyntynge þe nolle & þe nekke into þe myddell of þe rygge-bon byhynde
wiþ hote oyle of Camamylle. In þe secunde day he opnyde a lyte his

ellys a man þat were in a wondrynge; and þenne some wolden haue assayede
ȝif þat he wolde eten, & y wolde nouȝt  Suffren hym to eten,
& y seyde þowȝ þat he wolde eten he scholde noȝt. In þe þridde day y
spak to hym, & he answerde me bablynge as a childe þat begynneþ to

In þe fourþe day he spak bostynglyche, and þenne y gaf hym to drynke hot

þikke  tysan. In þe sixe day y gaf hym þe broth off a

whanne þat he myȝte take Suffisauntlye mete, y comaundyde hym to take
Pylulas Cochias, for to


      

resolfe by evacuacioun þe matere þat was y-gadrede togedire in þe hed by

þe whiche ys an opyn lesynge, for þe spiryt of lyf of felynge & of

bonys of þe rigge. Þe furste of þe bonys ys y-bounde wiþ a bon of þe hed
þat ys y-clepyde passilare wiþ manye smale feble ligamentys; & þey weren
feble bycause þat þilke Iuncte nexte þe hed myȝte meffe manye weyes. And
þe cause why þat þere were manye smale lygamentes multeplyede in þat
Iuncte, þat manye smale myȝte susteyne a grete burthyne as wel as a fewe

as y haue tauȝt tofore in þe  place of sowynge of synwes, and
leye aboffe lumbricus of þe

to casten aboue, þe poudre of lym, ffrank ensence & sank dragoun, & to
kepe þe sewynge & þe poudre with byndynge, tyl þat þe wounde be ful

peryle of leosynge, ffelynge & meffynge, & at þe laste to be ded, but
ȝif þe medycines þat y schal tellen afterwarde mowe helpen. And ȝif þat

ffor sodeyne exalacioun of þe spirites & also for Afynyte of þe herte; &
also ȝif þat þe canne off þe longes be y-kut twarte offere al atwo, for

Þe spawde ys one of þe iiij bonys whiche þat makiþ þe forme of þe
schuldre, & þe spawde-bon is þenne & brode towarde þe schuldres & in hys
endys grustly. On þe vppere syde of hym he haþ an egge sumwhat gret &
towarde þe arme in þe place of þe schuldre he ys grete & rounde. And
þilke ende ys holwe as a box, and þis bon ys lyche to a pele, þe whiche
men settyth brede into þe ovyne, and on þe hyndere partye of þe schuldre
he haþ an emynense. & in þe box of þis bon — — whiche ys y-clepyde
adiutorium þe whiche ys a bon sumwhat crokyde, gret & holowȝ. Þis bon ys
gret for necessite of strengthe, & of schappe holwe, þat he were lyȝte,
þat he scholde nouȝt þrowen his hevynesse lette þe wirchynge of
lacertes, and þe rounde extremite of þis bon entreþ into þe holwenesse
of the spaude. & þey beþ y-bounde togedre with a bowable ligament. Þe
canel-bon of þe brest ys in this manere


      

y-made, habbynge an additamente sumwhat  rounde in þe neþere
partye, þe whiche entryth a manere box, þe whiche ys in þe offere partye
of þe ovyre bon of þe vij. bonys of þe brest. And euerye extremyte of
þilke vij. bonys beþ y-Ioyned wiþ þe spawde, þat þe schuldre myghte be
þe more strenger; and forto make þis place þe more strengere, þere beþ
sette two smale bonys whiche beþ y-clepyde rostralis to þe lyknesse of
þe byle of a crowe, & forto fastne þe schuldres, þis bon rostrale ys y-

partye towarde þe elbowe tweye emynences, and þe on of þe emynence ys
more herre þenne þe othire; and boþe þese emynence beþ as yt were half a
bokett wiþ þe whiche men drawiþ water; and þilke tweye Additamentis beþ
y-Ioyned with þe bonys of þe arme. Þe Arme from þe Elbowe dunwarde, haþ
two bonys, and þe offere bon whiche þat strecchiþ from þe þowmbe þat ys
clepyde adiutorium is smallere bon, and þe neþere bon þat strecchith
from þe lytel fyngere to þe elbowe is þe grettere bon. & he haþ in þe
offere ende towarde the elbowe an additament like to a byle oþere a pyk,
and þilke pyk makyth þe elbowe scharpe, whenne þat þe arme ys y-folden,
and it letteþ þat þe arme may noȝt ben y-bowyde bakwarde. Þese tweye

      How Anectanabus fled Egypt to Macedonia

The most learned Egyptians who know the size of the earth, the waves of
the sea, and the order of the heavens (betokening the way of the stars
and the turning of the skies), have bequeathed these things to the whole
world through the highness and the wisdom of magic knowledge. And they
tell of a king of that land, by name Anectanabus, great in
understanding, and full of love in astrology and mathematics. Now, upon
a day it happened that a messenger came, and said unto him that
Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, was drawing nigh towards him with a
very great force of foes. Yet he did not call out his army, nor get
ready his advance. Instead of this, he hurried into his bedchambers in
his palace, and, taking down a brazen shell, which was full of rainwater, and holding in his hand a brazen rod, sought by magic spells to
summon the devils. By which wizardry he felt, in the shell itself, the
fleets sailing over him amid fearful affray.

Now there were lords of Anectanabus set in sway over his armies to guard
the Persian border.

And one hapless man coming to him, besought him: 'O most mighty King
Anectanabus, there ariseth against thee Artaxerxes, the king of the
Persians, with an untold horde of foes and strange races. For they are
Parthians, Medes, Persians, Syrians, Mesopotamians, Brapes, Phares,
Argiri, Chaldaeans, Bachiri, Confires, Hircanians, and Agiophii, and
many other folks coming from Eastern lands.' On hearing this,
Anectanabus said, sighing: 'The trust that I gave to thee, heed thou
right well; yet thy prowess hath not been the prowess of a doughty man,
but the doings of a cowardly fellow. For worth showeth itself, not in
the greatness of the folk, but in the steadfastness of their souls. Dost
thou not know one lion putteth many




      

does to flight?' And having said these words, he went into his chamber
alone, and made brazen shells, and filled them with rainwater, and held
in his hand a palm rod, and gazing into this, began, as hard as he
could, to utter spells, and beheld how the Egyptians were being smitten
down at the onslaught of the Barbarians' ships.

Forthwith he changed his dress, and shaved his head and beard, and took
gold as much as he might bear, and which might be needful to him to busy
himself with wizardry. And thus he fled from Egypt, near by Pelusium.
And at length, coming into Ethiopia, he put on linen apparel,  in
the guise of an Egyptian seer went into Macedonia. And there he sate
himself, and before all the Greeks, and in their sight was soothsaying.
But the Egyptians, when they saw how Anectanabus was not at Court, went
to Serapis, who was their greatest god, and besought him that he might
give them answer as to Anectanabus their king. And Serapis replied:
'Anectanabus, your king, is gone from Egypt because of Artaxerxes, the
king of the Persians, who will subdue you unto his lordship.
Nevertheless, when a short time hath flown by, he will come back to
shake off his thraldom, and will be avenged on your foes, and yoke them
under you.' And as soon as they had got this answer, they made a kingly
statue out of a black stone, in honour of Anectanabus. And they wrote on
it, at his feet, this saying, that it might be handed down for their
offspring to think of. But Anectanabus remained in Macedonia, nor was he
known.




      How Anectanabus went up to the Palace to Olympia the Queen.

In the meantime, Philip, king of Macedonia, went out to battle. But
Anectanabus went forward to the palace, that he might behold Olympia the
queen, and see how fair she was. And when he saw her, his heart was
smitten with love of her, and stretching forth his hand, he greeted her,
saying, 'Hail, Queen of Macedonia,' disdaining to call her 'lady'. And
she, Olympia, answered him, speaking thus: 'Hail, master, come thou and
sit near.' And when he sate thus, Olympia




      

asked many things of him. 'Art thou not an Egyptian?' And Anectanabus
answered: 'The word thou saidst was kingly, when thou didst name the
Egyptians. For the Egyptians are wise, and read dreams, understand the
birds of the air in their flight, open up the hidden places, and tell
the fate of those newborn, babes. Of all these things, as a seer, I,
too, have knowledge.' And Olympia saw how he gazed upon her, and spoke,
'Master, of what dost thou bethink thee, who thus lookest on me?' And
Anectanabus answered, 'I call to my mind many answers of the gods. One
answer had been that I was to look upon a queen.' And saying this, he
drew forth from his breast a cleansing tablet of bronze and ivory,
inwrought with gold and silver, and on its face were three whirls. The
first contained in itself the Twelve Minds, and in the third, sun and
moon were fashioned. Next to them, was seen a chain of ivory, and from
it he pulled forth sever wonderbright stars, that told the hours and
birthdooms of men, and seven carven stones, and two stones for the
saving men whole.

And Olympia beheld these things, and said: 'Master, if thou wouldst I
should believe thee, tell me the year, the day and hour of the king's
birth.' And upon this, he said to the queen, 'Wishest thou to hear
nothing else from me?' Quoth the queen, 'Tell me what shall fall out
betwixt Philip and me, for men say that, when Philip shall come from the
war, he will thrust me forth, and take another mate.' And Anectanabus
answered: 'They prate of many things untruly; but ere a long time pass,
it shall be as they say.' And the queen answered: 'I beg thee, master,
unveil me all the truth.' Thereupon Anectanabus:�'One of the mightiest
gods shall share thy bed and uphold thee through all thy thrivings and
downfalls, even if they be overstrong.' Olympia replied: 'I beseech
thee, say what shape this god shall put on?' Anectanabus replied:
'Neither young, nor old; his beard besprinkled with white hairs.
Wherefore, if this please thee, be ready for him, for at night shalt
thou see him, and in thy sleep shall he lie by thee.' The queen said:
'If I behold this, neither as a seer, nor as godly, but, as the god
himself, will I worship' . And at once Anectanabus said, 'Fare
thee well, O queen.' After this Anectanabus, leaving the palace, and
walking straight forth




      

to the city's camp in a desert spot, tore up herbs, and ground them, and
took their juice, and wrought spells and other like things of the fiend,
that in that same night Olympia might behold the god Hamon lying beside
her, and saying to her thereafter, 'Woman, thou hast conceived him who
shall beshield thee.' And, on the morrow, Olympia awoke from her
slumbers, and called Anectanabus to her, and told him of the dream she
had beheld. Then Anectanabus said: 'If thou wilt give me room in the
palace, thou shalt see the god himself, face to face. For that god shall
come to thee in the shape of a great snake, and soon after, taking on a
manlike body, he shall seem to be in my likeness.' And to this Olympia
said: 'As thou hast spoken, master, do. Take to thyself a bed in the
palace, and canst thou make good the truth thereof, I will deem thee to
be the father of the boy.' And, about the first watch of the night,
Anectanabus took on him, through spells and wizardry to be changed into
the shape of a great snake, and whistling on to the bedchamber of
Olympia, to fly through. And he entered her room, and rose on to her
bed, and with great love began to kiss her, and the kisses betokened to
her who he was. And when he rose up from the bed, he smote her on the
womb, and spake: 'This begetting be thy avenging, and in no wise may it
be upbraided of men.'

On such a fashion was Olympia cheated, who had lain with a man as though
he had been a god. And in the morning, Anectanabus went down from the
palace, and the queen was with child.

And when she began to be big, she called unto her Anectanabus, saying:
'Master, tell me, what doom will Philip wreak on me, when he shall come
back?' And Anectanabus said to her, 'Be not afraid: god Hamon will
champion thee.' And with these words he left the palace, and went
outside the town, to a barren spot. And, uprooting grasses, rubbed them,
and grated them, and took their sap. And he caught a seabird, and began
to sing over the herbs, and anoint the herbs with the sap. This he did
in fellowship with the fiends, that he might betray King Philip through
a dream. And this was brought about. That same night the god Hamon
appeared to Philip, in a dream, lying with his wife Olympia, and, the
night ended, he




      

saw him touch her womb, and seal it with a golden ring. And on the ring
there was a stone, and graven on this a lion's head, and the chariot of
the sun, and a very sharp sword. And he said to her: 'Woman, thou hast
conceived thy saviour.' And Philip awoke from his sleep, and calling
Arideus, made known to him the dream, and what he had seen. And Arideus
said: 'Philip, not from man, but from a god, hath thy wife conceived. In
truth, the lion's head and the chariot of the sun and the sharp sword,
foretoken that he, who shall be born of her, shall journey to the East
whence riseth the sun! And with the sharp sword shall he underyoke to
himself the nations of the whole world.'




      How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Mighty Dragon went to the fore
      in front of Philip and overcame his Enemies in the Fray.

In the meanwhile, King Philip fought and won. For there appeared in the
battle a dragon, who went before him and laid low his foes. And when he
came back to Macedonia, he met and kissed Olympia. And King Philip gazed
upon her, and said, 'To whom, O Olympia, hast thou given thyself up. For
sinned thou hast, yet not sinned, for as much as thou hast brooked
frowardness from a god. But I have seen all that has been done by a god
on thee, in a dream: therefore be blameless in my eyes, and the eyes of
all men!' 


      How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Dragon came before Philip at a
      Festival and kissed Olympia.

On a certain day Philip was feasting with his lords and chieftains of
Macedonia and with Olympia his wife. And Anectanabus through wizardry
took on himself the shape of a dragon, and, passing through the midst of
the couch whereon they lay apart, whistled so loudly that all the
revellers were stricken with fear, and the greatest dread, and coming
near Olympia, he put his head on her breast and kissed her. Philip,
seeing this, spoke to Olympia, 'Woman, thee and all I tell; beheld this
dragon, what time I laid my enemies low.' 


      


      How a Bird laid an Egg in Philip's Bosom at whose breaking there
      came forth a Serpent, which forthwith died.

And a few days after this Philip the king was sitting in his palace, and
there appeared unto him a little and most gentle bird, which flew into
his bosom and laid an egg. And the egg, falling to the ground, was
broken. And at once there crept forth from it a very little snake. And
it turned around, wishful to go into the egg, but, before it might put
in its head, it was quenched. And Philip, seeing this, was heavily
distressed, and called to him Arideus, and showed him the monstrous
thing he had seen. And Arideus said to him, 'King Philip, a son shall be
born to thee, who shall reign after thy death, and shall fare forth over
the whole world and sway all peoples, and ere he come back to the land
of his birth, shall die by a most swift death.'

And as the time of childbirth was drawing nigh, Olympia began to feel
pain, and her womb was tormented, and she bade Arideus be called to her,
and spoke with him: 'Master, my womb is wrenched with very heavy
labours.' Anectanabus  then spake:
'Raise thyself awhile from thy throne, for in this hour the elements are
troubled by the sun.' This was done, and the pain went from her. And
soon after, Anectanabus said to her, 'Sit down, O Queen!' and she sate
herself and bore a child. And as soon as the boy was fallen on to the
earth, a mighty thunderclap and thunderbolts, with tokens and lightnings
came about throughout the whole world. Then night was spread forth and
lasted, it reaching unto the last hour of day. Then parts of the clouds
fell down in Italy. And seeing these signs, Philip the king was
afrighted, and went in to Olympia, and said: 'I deemed that this little
babe should in no wise be fostered. For he is not conceived of me, but
of some god, for at his birth I beheld the heavens changed. Yet let him
be fostered in my memory, as though he were my son, and follow in the
stead of a son I begot through another wife.' And when he said this, she
handled the babe with great care. And the boy's face had the likeness
neither of father nor mother. The hair on his head




      

was shaggy as a lion's. His eyes glistened like the stars, but each
beamed with its own hue, one black, the other yellow. And his teeth were
sharp, and his eager rush as a lion's. His shape foreshadowed his energy
and forethought. By his parents he was called Alexander. In the schools,
and wheresoever he sate, he strove with them in letters and
disputations, and by his keen swiftness won the mastership. And when he
was twelve years old, he was beweaponed for battle, and excelled in
arms. And Philip, seeing how quick he was, praised him, and said: 'Son
Alexander, I love thy speed, and wit of mind for its work. But I am sore
and feel foolish that thy form is no unlike mine.' And Olympia heard
this, and was greatly afraid. And she called hither Anectanabus, and
said: 'Master, learn from me what Philip misdeemeth. For he said to
Alexander, "Son, I love thy speed and wit of mind. But, that thy shape
is unlike mine, I am saddened."' And Anectanabus began to think, and
said: 'His thought is nowise harmful.' And gazing aloft as he was wont,
he looked on a certain star, and riddled out his wish. And when
Alexander heard this, he spake: 'The star thou seest is seen in the
heavens?' And Anectanabus replied: 'My son, it is.' Alexander said:
'Canst thou show it unto me?' Anectanabus answered: 'Follow me in the
hour of night, and I will show it unto thee.' Alexander said: 'Thy fate
is not known to thee, or uncertain?' Anectanabus replied: 'Enough of
this.' Alexander said: 'I would fain know it.' Anectanabus answered: 'In
truth know that from my son shall come my death.' This said, as he went
down from the palace, Alexander followed him in the hour of the evening
without the city. And when they arrived up on to the ditch of the city,
Anectanabus spake: 'Son Alexander, gaze thou on the stars; look how the
star of Hercules is perplexed, and how Mercury's star is blithe. If I
see Jove sparkling, my doom telleth me of my coming death at the hands
of my son.' At this sight Alexander came up nigh to him, and made an
onslaught on him, making him fall

   down̛ in to þe dyke, and
thare he feƚƚe, & was aƚƚ tofrusched̛; and þan̛ Alexander said̛ vnto hym
one this wyse. 'Fals


      

wreche,' quoþ he, 'that presumeȝ to teƚƚ thyngeȝ þat ere to com̛, reȝte
als þou were a prophete, and knewe þe preuateȝ of heuen̛. Now may þou see
that þou lyeȝ, And þarefore þou arte worthy to hafe swilke a dede.' And
than̛ Anectanabus ansuerd̛, & said̛: 'I wyste wele ynoghe,' quoþ he, 'þat I
scholde die swylke a dede. Talde I noȝte lange are to þe, that myn̛ awenn̛
son̛ schulde slae me ?' 'Whi, ame I thi son̛ ?' þan̛ quoþ Alexandire: 'ȝaa,
for sothe,' quoþ Anectanabus, ' I gat the.' And wit þat word̛, he ȝalde
þe gaste. And than̛ Alexander hert tendird̛ on̛ his Fader, And he tuke hym
vp on his bakke, and bare hym to þe palace. And when̛ his moder Olympias
saw hym, Scho said̛ vntiƚƚ hym. 'Son̛,' quoþ scho, 'what es that?' 'Als
thi foly hase made it,' quoþ he, 'so it es.' And than̛ he gert berye hym
wirchipfully.

In the mene tyme, a prynce of Macedoyne broghte þe kyng a horse vntemed̛, a grete and a faire; & he was tyed̛ on̛ ilke side wit chynes of
Iren̛, for he walde wery men̛ and ete þam̛. This ilke horse was called̛
Buktiphalas, bicause of his vgly lukynge, For he hade a heued̛ lyke a
buƚƚe, & knottiƚƚs in his frount, as þay had hene þe bygynnyng of
hournes. And when̛ þe kyng saw þe bewtee of this horse, he said tiƚƚ his
seruandis, 'Takeȝ this horse and putteȝ hym in a stable, and makes
barreȝ of yren̛ before hym, that thefeȝ and oþer mysdoers, þat saƚƚ be
done to dede, may be putt intiƚƚ hym, to be slaen̛ of hym. And þay didd̛
soo. In þe mene tyme þe kynge Philippe had̛ ane answere of his goddes,
that hee schulde regne nexte after hym, the whilke myghte ryde that

discrete; for he was wele lered̛ & connand̛ in aƚƚ þe seuen̛ sciences, þe
whilke twa philosophirs had teched̛ hym : þat es to say, Arestotle &
Calistene. And one a day, as Alexander passed̛ forby þe place þare als

bifore þe horse, mens hend̛ and fete, & oþer of þaire membris, liggand̛

doun̛ on̛ his kneesse, and bihelde Alexander in þe vesage langly. And
Alexander vnderstode wele þe wiƚƚ of þe horse, and opynd̛ the barreȝ, and
went into þe horse, and straked̛ him softely on þe bakke wit his riȝte
hand̛; And belyfe þe horse wexe wonderly meke tiƚƚ Alexander; and riȝte
as a honde wiƚƚ couche when̛ his maister biddes hym, so dide he tiƚƚ
Alexander; and Alexander lukede besides hym, & sawe a sadiƚƚ & a brydeƚƚ
hyng thare; and he tuke & dyd̛þam̛ on̛ hym̛, & leppe one his bakke & rade
furthe on̛ hym. And when̛ the kynge Philippe sawe hym do so, he said̛ vntiƚƚ hym 'Mi son̛ Alexander' quoþ he: 'Aƚƚ þe ansuers of our goddeȝ are
fulfillede in the! For when̛ I ame dede, þou mon̛ regne after me' And
Alexander ansuerd; & said̛ 'I pray the, Fader,' quoþ he, 'ordeyne me
horse & men̛, for I gaa seke dedeȝ of armeȝ.' 'For sothe' quoþ þe kynge
wit a glade chere, 'Take þe a hundreth horse, and xl thosandeȝ pounde of
golde; and take wit the of þe worthieste knyghteȝ þat langeȝ to me, and
wendis furthe.' And he didd̛so.

And he tuke wit hym also a philosopℏre þat highte Eufestius, whilke he
traysted̛ mekiƚƚ in, And twelue childre þat he chese to be his playfers,
and went hym furthe, and come intiƚƚ a contreth þat es called Polipone.
And when̛ the kynge of þe land̛ herd̛ teƚƚ, þat swilke men̛ ware entred̛ into his rewme in swilke araye, he raysed̛ a gret Oste, and come agaynes
Alexander for to feghte wit hym̛. And when̛ he come nerehand̛ hym, he said̛
vntiƚƚ hym. 'Teƚƚ me' quoþ he 'whatt þou ert ?' And Alexander ansuerd̛
'I am Alexander' quoþ he 'þe son̛ of Philippe, þe kynge of Macedoyne.'
'And what hopeȝ þou þat I be ?' quoþ þe kynge tiƚƚ hym. And Alexander
ansuerd̛. 'Þou ert kynge of Arridouns' quoþ he. 'Neuerþelesse, if aƚƚ I

For men̛ seeȝ ofte tymes men̛ þat ere in heghe astate com̛ to lawe degree,
& men̛ þat ere in lawe degree, come tiƚƚ heghe astate.' 'Þou sais riȝte

wrathe, And said tiƚƚAlexander


      

'Luke on me' quoþ he 'þat spekes to the: Fore I swere the be my

spitte at Alexander, & said̛: 'Take þe þare, þou biche whelpe, þat þe

hame fra oþer.

And agaynes þe day of Bateƚƚe, Alexander, bi ascent & ordynance of kynge
Philippe, gadird a grete Oste, & went to the place þare þe Bateƚƚe was
assigned, and fand aƚƚ redy þare, kyng Nicoƚƚ and his oste. And þay
trumpped̛ vp appon̛ bathe þe parties, and bigan̛ to feghte, & many men̛ ware

tuke kyng Nichoƚƚ, & gart smytte of his heued̛, & went intiƚƚ his land,
and conquered it; and his knyghtes went and coround̛ hym kynge þareoff.
And sythen̛ he went hame tiƚƚ his fader, kyng Philippe, and fand̛ hym
sittand̛ at the mete at a bridale: For he had put awaye fra hym his wyfe
Olympias, Alexander moder, and taken̛ hym anoþer þat highte Cleopatra;
And Alexander went into þe hauƚƚe, and said vnto þe kynge Philipp̛:
'Fader,' quoþ he, 'I pray ȝow, þat for a rewarde of my firste iournee
þat I hafe now made, ȝee graunte me to take my Moder Olympias agayne vnto ȝow, & do to hir as awe to be done to a qwenne, rathere þan̛ I gyffe

ansuerd̛ & said̛ to þe kyng: 'lord̛' quoþ he 'þou schall hafe a son̛ of
Cleopatra, and he schaƚƚ regne after þe !' Alexander, than̛, was gretly
greuede at his wordes, and wit a wardrere þat he hade in his hande, he went


      

tiƚƚ hym and kellede hym. When̛ kyng Pℏilippe sawe this, he was gretly
stirred̛, and rase vp, & gatt a swerde & ranne towardeȝ

nerre Alexander þat he drewe, þe mare he feƚƚe to the erthe riȝte as he

troubbled, and the brydale letted. And Alexander went abowte þe hauƚƚe,
and keste doun̛ þe bourdeȝ wit þe mete, & þe drynke þat ware appon̛ þam̛,
and tuke Cleopatra, and schotte hir oute at þe hauƚƚe dore. And the
kynge Philippe, for sorowe þat he tuke tiƚƚ, feƚƚe grefe seke. And a
littiƚƚ afterwardeȝ, Alexander went tiƚƚ hym for to vesett hym &
comforthe hym, and said̛ vntiƚƚ hym 'Philippe,' quoþ he, 'if aƚƚ it be
noȝte semely, þat I calle þe be þi propre name; neuereþelesse, noȝte

Philippe herd̛ þir wordes, his hert tendird̛, & he bigane to wepe. And þan̛
Alexander went tiƚƚ his Moder Olympyas, and said̛ vntiƚƚ hir: 'Be noȝte

when̛ be hade sayde thus, he ledd̛ hir furthe to þe kyng Philippe. And he

After þis, þare come messengers Fra Darius, þe emperour of Perse, to

messengers, & saide, 'Saise to Darius, ȝour lorde,' quoþ he, 'þat sen̛ þe

messengers herd̛ thir wordes; þay hade grete wounder of þam & of þe witt

In þe mene tyme tythyngeȝ come to kyng Philippe, þat Ermonye, þe whilke
bifore was suget vntiƚƚ hym, was rebeƚƚe & raysse agaynes hym. And he
garte semble a grete Oste, and sent Alexander thedir þare wit to

than̛went wit this Oste tiƚƚ Ermony & broghte it agayne in subieccion̛, as
it was bifore.

An in þe mene tyme, whils he was þare, a lorde of Macedoyne þe whilke
highte Pansamy, a strange man̛ & a balde, suget vnto Philippe, and bade
of lange tyme couette for to hafe þe quene Olympias, conspirede agaynes

mete hym in þe felde wit a fewe menȝee. And when̛ he sawe þe grete

persued̛ after hym̛, and ouerhied̛ hym, and strake hym thurghe wit a spere,
and ȝitt ife aƚƚ he were greuosely wonded̛, he dyed̛ noȝte alsone, bot he

gretly empridede þare offe, & went in to þe kynges palace for to take þe
qwene Olympias oute of it and hafe hir with hym. And euen̛ þe same tyme,
Alexander come fra Hermony, & sawe swylke trouble & styrrynge in the

herd̛ teƚƚe þat Alexander hir son̛ had þe victorye of his enemys, & was

scho criede appon̛ hym̛ & said̛.

'A A, my son Alexander, whare es þe grace & þe fortune þat oure goddes

And alsone the worde come to Pansamy þat Alexander was comen̛, and he
went furthe of palace for to mete hym̛. And also faste als Alexander sawe

'Philippe þi fader' quoþ he, 'lyas dade in þe felde.' And þan Alexander
went thedir thare he laye, and saw hym euen̛ at þe dyinge. And þan̛ he

When kyng Philippe was entered, Alexander went and sett hym in his

And when̛ þe lordes and knyghtis þat ware of grete age, herd̛ thir wordes
þay ansuerd̛ Alexander, & said̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛: 'lorde,' quoþ thaye, 'we hafe

Sone after Alexander assemblede a grete Oste, & went bi Schippe towardeȝ Ytaly, and als he come by Calcedoyne, he assaylled̛ it reȝte
strangly, and þe folke of Calcedoyne went to þe walles of þe
Citee and defendid̛ manly. Bot at the laste Alexander wan̛ the Citee, and

Fra thethyn he Schippede intiƚƚ Affrice, in thee whilke he fande bot

dreme, he was reghte heuy, and sent þe maste substance of his Oste to þe
Cite of Askalon̛ and bad þaim̛ habide hym thare, and hym selfe & a certane
of menȝe wit hym habade & thare he garte make a Citee & called̛ it
Alexander after his awenn̛ name.

In the mene tyme , Egipcyens herd̛ of þe comynges of Alexander, & þay
went agaynes hym & submytt þam̛ vntiƚƚhym & resayffed̛ hym wirchipfully.
And when̛ Alexander come intiƚƚ Egipte, he fand ane ymage of a kyng made
of blake stane curiousely coruen̛, and he askede þe Egipciens whase ymage
it was, and þay ansuerd̛ & said, 'It es þe ymage,' quop þay, 'of
Anectanabus that was kynge of Egipte noȝte lange sythen̛ gane, þe wyseste
& þe worthiest þat euer was þarein̛.' For sothe quoþ Alexander,
'Auectanabus was my Fader.' And þan he knelid doun̛ with grete reuerence
& kyssed̛ þe ymage. Fra thethyn̛ he went wit his Oste to Surry. But þe
Surriens agaynestude hym and faghte wit hym̛ and slewe many of his
knyghtes. Neuer þe lesse Alexander had þe victorye. And þan̛ he went to
Damaske, & Ensegged̛ it & wanne it, and fra thethyn̛ he went to Sydon &
wan it. And þan̛ he went vnto þe Citee of Tyre and layde Ensegge abowte
it, and  þis Ensegge he laye many a day. And thare


      

his Oste suffred̛ many dysesseȝ. For þat Cite was so strange in itselfe
bycause of þe ground̛, þat it was sett apon̛, and bycause of grete
towres & many þat ware abowte it, and also bicause it was so enclosed̛
wit the see þat it myghte noghte lightly be wonnen̛ by nane
assawte. Alexander þan̛ vmbithoghte hym, one what wyse he myghte best com̛
to for to destruy þis citee, and he gerte make a grete basteƚƚ of tree,
and sett it apon̛ schippes in þe see euen̛ forgaynes þe cete, so þat þare
myghte no shippeȝ come nere the hauen̛ for to vetaille þe Citee or
suppoeƚƚ it wit men̛ bycause of þe basteƚƚe. In þe mene tyme Alexander
Oste hade grete defawte of vetayƚƚs, and þan̛ he sent lettres vnto Iadus,
þat at that tyme was bischoppe & gouernoure of þe Iewes, and prayede hym
for to suppoeƚƚ hym wit som̛ men̛, and also þat he walde send̛ sum̛ vetails
for hym & his Oste, and he scholde pay for þam̛ wit a glade chere, and
þat he scholde also send̛ hym the tribute þat he scholde gyffe Darius þe
emperour of Perse. For hym ware better, he said̛, hafe his frenchippe þan̛
þe frenchipe of Darius. The Bischope þan̛ of þe Iewes ansuerd̛ þe
messangers þat broghte hym þe lettres & said̛ 'I hafe,' quoþ he, ' made
athe to Darius, þat, whils he leffeȝ, I schaƚƚ neuer bere armes agaynes
hym̛, and þarefore I ne may noȝte do agaynes myn̛ Athe.' The Messagers þan̛
went till Alexander & talde hym þe bischopes ansuere, and he was greued̛
& said̛ 'I make myn̛ avowe,' quþ he, 'vntiƚƚ oure goddes, þat I schaƚƚ
take swilke vengeance on þe Iewes þat I saƚƚ make þam̛ to knawe, whethir
it es better to þam̛ to be obeisant vnto  commandement, or vnto
þe kynges of Perse.' And he callede a duke, þat highte Melagere, and wit
vc men̛ of armes, and badd̛ þam̛ gaa in to þe vale of Iosaphat, þe whilke
was fuƚƚ of besteȝ & brynge of thase besteȝ to þe Oste for to vetaiƚƚe

went in to þe vale, and gadird̛ to gedir catell witowte nombir & began̛

slewe many of þam̛. Bot Melagere & his felaws at þat tym̛ had þe better.
And ane þat highte Caulus went baldly to Theosellas, & smate of his

Bertyne,


      

lorde of þe citee, seand̛ this, was gretely stirrede and ischewede owte
of þe citee & wit xxx feghtyng men̛ and sett vp a schowte apon̛ the
Macedoynes aƚƚe at anes, that aƚƚe þe erthe trembled̛ witaƚƚe. And̛ when̛
þe Macedoyns saw that grete multytude of folke com̛ appon̛ þam̛, þay were
reȝte ferde. And þan Melagere walde hafe sent a Messangere to þaire
lorde Alexander, for to come & socoure þam̛, bot he mygte fynd̛ na man̛ þat
walde vndertake þe Message. Than thir twa batalles met Samen̛ & faughte
togedir, and thare was Sampson slaen, and Bertyne. And þe Macedoyns wit
þe grete multitude of þaire enemys ware dreuen̛ abakke, and lyke for to
be dreuen̛ abakke & discomfites. And ane of þe grekkes, þat highte
Arttes, seynge þe meschefe þay stode In, wann̛ hym owte of the Bataile &
went in alle þe haste, þat he myghte, tiƚƚ Alexander & talde hym þat þe
Grekkes & þe Macedoynes ware in poynte to be mescheuede, bot if he
suppoellde þam̛ þe tittere. And than Alexander lefte þe segge of Tyre,
and went wit his Oste to þe vale of Iosaphat, and fand̛ his men̛ riȝte
harde bystadde wit þaire enemys. And he and his Oste vmbylapped̛ alle
þaire enemys, and daunge þam̛ doun̛ & slewe þam̛ ilke a moder son̛. And when̛
he had so done he turned̛ agayne vnto Tyre, and fande the Bastelle, þat
he hade made in þe See, dongen̛ doune to þe grounde. For alson̛ als
Alexandere was gane fra Tire to þe vale of Iosaphat, Balan̛ þat was lorde
of Tyre ischewid̛ oute of þe citee wit thee folke þareof, & assailled̛
the basteƚƚ manfully, and tuk it & dange it doune. And when̛ Alexander
sawe that, he was gretly angerde, and his hert wonder heuy, and so ware
aƚƚe þe Macedoynes and the Grekes. In so mekiƚƚ thay ware nerehand̛ in
dispeire for to wyn̛ þe citee, and ware in poynte to hafe riffen up þe
segge. And one þe nyghte nexte suande, Alexander, als he laye & slept,
dremyd̛ þat he hadd̛ in his hand̛ a grape, þe whilke hym thoghte he keste
downe vnder his fete, and trade þareone, & alsone þare ran̛ oute of it a
grete dele of wyne. And when̛ Alexander wakned̛, he called̛ tiƚƚ hym̛ a
Philosophre & talde hym his dreme. And þe Philosophre ansuerde, 'be
balde,' quoþ he, '& lefe noȝte to ensegge Tyre, for þe grape þat þou


      

helde in thi hand̛, and keste vnder thi fete, and trade þareone, es þe
Citee of Tyre, þe whilk þou saƚƚ wynn̛ thurgℏ strentℏ and trede it with

wordes, he was gretly comforthed̛, and vmbithoghte hym̛ one whate wyse he
myghte gette this Citee.

And than̛ he garte make anoþer basteƚƚe in þe see, grettere, &
hyere, and strangere þan þe toþer was. For it was hiere þan̛ þe hegheste
towre of þe citee. And þis basteƚe was tyede wit a hundrethe ankers. Þan̛
Alexander gert armede hyn̛ suerely & wele, & wente by hym ane vp apon̛
this basteƚƚe, and badd̛ aƚƚ his men̛ þat þay schulde make þam̛ redy for to
feghte & to giffe assawte to þe citee. And alsone als þay sawe hym
entire in to þe citee, þay scholde aƚƚ at anes presse to þe walles, and
scale þam̛, and clymbe ouer þe walles baldely & wyn̛ þe citee. And when̛
aƚƚ men̛ weren̛ redy, hee gerte smyte soundere þe cabiƚƚs þat þe basteƚƚe
was tyed̛ wit, & þe wawes of þe see bare it to þe walles of þe Citee. And
Alexander delyuerlye stert apon̛  walles, whare Balan̛ stode, and ran̛
apon̛ hym & slew hym and keste hym ouer þe walles into þe dyke of þe
citee. And when̛ þe Macedoyns & þe Grekes sawe Alexander entir into þe
citee, þay schouffed̛ to þe walles aƚƚ at anes, and clambe ouer, sum̛ wit
leddirs sum̛ on oþer wyse witowtten̛ any resistence. For þe Tyreyenes was
so ferde bycause of þe dedde of Balan̛ þaire duc þat þay ne durste noghte
turne agayne no defende þe walleȝ. And on̛ this wyse was þe citee taken̛
and doungen̛ doune to þe erthe.

Fra þe segge of Tyre Alexander & his men̛ went to þe citee of Gaȝa and
assailed̛it, & wit schorte while þay wan̛ it. And Fra thethyn̛ hyed̛ hym
towardeȝ Ierusalem for to ensegge it.

Qwhen̛ þe Bischoppe of þe Iewes herde teƚƚe þat Alexander was commaund

commandid̛ þam̛ þat þay schuld̛ com̛ to þe temple, and be þare in praynge
Fastyngeȝ and wakynge & in sacrafice makyng vnto godd̛, bisekand hym of

after, when þe Bischoppe hadd̛ made his sacrafice, and was lyand̛ in
prayers, he feƚƚ on slomeryng and ane Angeƚƚe appered̛ vntiƚƚ hym, and
sayd̛, 'Be noȝte ferd̛,' quoþ he, 'bot swythe gere araye honestly aƚƚ þe

And þis es þe cause I wirchipped hym.' And when̛ he hadd̛ said̛ thies

into þe temple þat Salamon̛ made. And as þe bischope teched̛ hym̛ he
offred̛ sacrafice unto Godd̛. And þe bischope tuke Alexander in hande a
buke of þe prophicye of Daniel , in þe whilke he fande wretyn̛,
þat a man̛ of Grece sulde distruy þe powere of Perse. And Alexander was
reghte gladde, supposynge þat it was hymselfe. And þan̛ he gaffe þe

bischope ashe of hym what so he walde. And the bischope askede þat he

Alexander than̛ went fra Ierusalem, & lefte thare Andromac his Messagere,
and hym selfe & his Oste went to þe oþer citeȝ þat ware in þe lande of
Iudee, and at ilke a citee þat he come to, he was wirchipfully

Darius spirred̛ thaym̛ of his stature & of his schappe, and þay schewed̛

Darius sawe it, he dispysed̛ Alexander bycause of his littiƚƚ stature,
and belyfe he gerte


      

write a lettre and sent it till Alexander. And þarewit he sent hym a
handbaƚƚ & oþer certane Iapeȝ in scorne. And þis is þe tenour of þe
lettre þat he sent tiƚƚ hym.

    'Darius, kyng of kynges, and lord̛ of aƚƚ erthely lordes euen̛ like

When̛ þe messangers þat were sent fra Darius come to king Alexander, þay
gaffe hym the lettres, and þe baƚƚe & oþer certane Iapes, þat þe
emperour sent hym in scorne. And Alexander tuke þe lettres, and gert

Alexander sawe þam̛ so heuy by cause of þe lettre, he saide vnto þam: 'a

When Alexander had̛ saide thir wordeȝ he bade his knyghtis take the

Þan̛ kyng Alexander badd̛ his knyghtis lowse þam̛, and bryng þam̛ intiƚƚ

And as þay satt at the mete, þir messangers saide vn tiƚƚ Alexander,
'lorde,' quoþ þay, 'if it be plesynge to ȝour hye maiestee sendeȝ with

Apon þe morne, Alexander gart write a lettre vnto Darius, whareoffe þe
tenour was this.

When̛ Darius hadde redde þis lettre, þare come anoþer messanger till hym

When̛ þe Messangers of Darius come tiƚƚ Alexander, þay tuk hym þe lettre

    'Alexander þe son̛ of Philippe & of qwene Olympias vnto Darius kynge

This lettre bekende Alexander to þe knyghtis of Darius, þe peper also,

Thare was þe same tyme a wonder wyse man̛ of werre þe whilke highte

into þo temple of þe son̛, and thare he made sacrafyce to þe son̛. Fra
thethyn̛, he come to a reuere, þat es called̛ Stamandra, and þare he said̛
tiƚƚ his men. 'Blyste mote ȝe be', quoþ he, 'þat hase getyn̛

'Me ware leuer,' quoþ he, 'be a wyse manes disciple þan for to hafe þe

suggournede þare wit her a while. And than̛ he ordeyned hym̛ for to wende

þay sperede þe ȝates of þe Citee, and wachede þe citee one ilke a syde.
And when̛ Alexander saw þat, he went & assaillede þe Citee. And þe burgeȝ
of þe Citee, when̛ þay sawe þat þe citee was noȝte strange ynoghe of þe

þe Citaȝenes opened̛ þe ȝates. Fra thethen̛ þay went to Comnoliche. And

whar þay fande vetails ynoghe, and mete ynoghe for þaire horse. Fra
thethyn̛ þay remoued̛ & come tiƚƚ a place þat hatt Trigagantes, and þare

Alexander ansuered̛, & said̛, 'Now þat þou calleȝ me Hercules,' quoþ he:
'I see wele þat aƚƚ thyn̛ ansuers ere false.' Fra thethyn Alexander went
till a citee þat es called̛ Thebea, and said vnto þe folke of þe citee:
'Sendeȝ me furthe,' quoþ he, 'foure hundreth knyghtis, wele armed̛ for to

spered̛ þe ȝates of þe citee, for to agaynestande Alexander, and went to
þe walleȝ, and cried̛ lowde þat Alexander myghte here: 'Alexander,' quoþ
þay, 'bot if  gaa hethyn̛ fra vs, we saƚƚ do the a velany, & thi

Fire also bygan̛ for to sett in houseȝ witin þe citee, & rayse a grete

Alexander fra þe citee of Thebe, went to Corynthe, and þare come tiƚƚ

And he graunted̛ þam̛. And to þis Ilke wrestillynge þare come folke

Alexander bad hym ga to. And Clitomarus went into þe place, and þe

And when̛ he herde þis he was righte wrathe wit hir, & saide, 'þou arte

    ' Alexander, þe son of Philippe and of qwene Olympias, vn to the

When̛ þe Athenyenes herd̛ þis lettre redd̛, þay ware riȝte gladd̛, and þan̛
Alexander & his Oste went fra thethyn̛ vnto Lacedoyne. Bot þe Lacedouns
walde one na wyse obey vntiƚƚ Alexander, bot said̛ ilkan̛ of þam̛ tiƚƚ

went manly to þe walles. And a grete nowmer of þam̛ tuke þam̛ schippeȝ &
went to þe see, a grete nauy, to feghte wit Alexander are he come to

this wyse.

    'Alexander þe son̛ of Philippe and of þe quene Olympias vnto þe

The Lacedounes redd̛ þis lettre, and when̛ it was redd̛, þay ware wonder

an oþer coste, and come to þe citee are þay wiste and vmbylapped̛ þe
citee one ilke a syde, and assaillede it strangly & dange þe Lacedouns
of þe walles & slewe many of þam̛ & wounded̛ many, and sett fyre in þaire

appon lyfe, when̛ þay saw this grete meschefe come owte of þe citee vntiƚƚ Alexander, & feƚƚe doun̛ at his fete, & besoughte hym of mercy & of

bot in þat degre ȝe walde noȝte ressayffe me, þarefore now are ȝour

Whan he hadd̛ saide on this wise, he gaffe þam̛ leue to gaa whare
þay walde. And than̛ he remouede thethyn̛ & went towarde Ciciƚƚ. And when̛
þe emperour Darius herd̛ tell of þe comyng of Alexander, he was gretly
abaiste and sent after aƚƚ his princeȝ, Dukes & Erles, & oþer grete

quoþ he, 'þat he, this Alexander, þat gase thus abowte werrayand̛, waxeȝ

þat whils we ere abowte, & weneȝ to putte hym out of Ellada, we be

When̛ Darius hadd̛ said thir wordeȝ, his broder Coriather


      

ansuerd̛ & said̛, ' þou hase here,' quoþ he, 'gretly magnified̛ & commendid̛
Alexander, in that, þat þou sais he es mare feruent for to come into

Quod̛ Darius, 'wheþer awe me to take sa ensample at Alexander, or

ansuerd̛ & saide, 'whate tyme,' quoþ he, 'þat I was sent to Macedoyne for
til aske tribute of kyng Philippe, I saw, bi his Figure & his wise
ansuere, þat he schuld be a passyng man̛, bathe of witt, & of doynges.
Tharefore, if it be plesyng vnto ȝow, I conseƚƚ þat ȝe sende tiƚƚ aƚƚ

and his mens also. And owþer he saƚƚ for fere turne hame agayne tiƚƚ his

chaseȝ a grete floke of schepe & gerse þam̛ sparple. Righte so, and þe
wysdome of þe grekes passeȝ oþer nacyons.'

In this mene tym̛, Alexander sembled̛ a gret multitude of folke to þe
nowmer of cc of feghtynge men̛, and remewed to warde Perse, & come tiƚƚ a
reuere þat es called̛ Mociona, of whilke þe water was wonder calde, &
faire, & clere. And Alexander hadd̛ a grete lyste for to be bathede þarein, and went into it & bathed hym, & waschede hym þarein, and also son̛
he feƚƚe in a feuer and a heuedwerke þarewit, so þat he fure wonder
iƚƚ. And when̛ þe Macedoyns saw þaire lorde so grefe seke, þay were
wonder heuy and reghte dredand̛ and said amanges selfe: 'And Darius,'
quod þay, 'wete þat oure lorde Alexander be þus seke, he saƚƚ come &
falle apon̛ vs sodaynly, & fordo vs ilkan̛. For, and we hadd̛ þe hele of
oure lorde Alexander, we hadd̛ comforth ynoghe & dredde no nacyon̛.' Than
kyng Alexander called̛ tiƚƚ hym his Phicisiene þaf highte Philippe & badd̛
hym ordeyne hym a Medcyne for his sekenes. Þis ilk Phicisiene
was bot a ȝong man̛, bot he was a passyng kunnyng man̛ and a soteƚƚ in aƚƚ
þe poyntes þat langed to phisic. And he highte Alexander, þat  a
certane drynke he sulde onane make hym aƚƚ hale. Nowe feƚƚ it, þat was
wit Alexander a prynce, þat highte Parmenius & was lorde of hermony.
This prynce hade grete envy to þis phicsiene, bicause þat Alexander
luffede hym so passandly wele & belyfe he wrate tiƚƚ Alexander, and
warned̛ hym þat he schulde be warre wit Phillippe his phicisiene, and on

Darius had highte to giffe hym his doghter to wyffe & his kyngdom̛ after

mekiƚƚ he tristede of þe conscience of his phisician.

In þe mane tyme, þis Phisician come tiƚƚ Alexander wit þe forsaid
drynke, and Alexander tuk þis drynke in a hande & þe forsaid lettre in
his oþer hande and biheld̛ þe Phisician in þe vesage riȝte scharpely. To
whome þe Phisician saide:


      

'wirchipfuƚƚ Emperour,' quoþ he 'be na thyng fered̛ bot drynke þe medcyne
baldely,' and þan̛ onane Alexander tuk this drynke, & schewed̛ Philippe þe
lettre. And when̛ Philippe had redde þe lettre, he said tiƚƚ Alexander:
'Now for sothe, my lorde,' quoþ he, 'I take oure goddes to witnesse þat
I ne am noȝte gilty of this treson̛, þat here es wretyn̛.' Alexander þan̛
was aƚƚ hale als euer he was, & called̛ vntiƚƚ Philyppe his phisician &
enbraced̛ hym in his armes & said̛: Philippe,' quoþ he, 'knawes þou how
mekill luffe & triste I hafe in the. Firste I dranke thi medecyne, &
syne I schewede þe þe lettre þat was sent me agaynes the.' 'Mi lorde,'
quoþ Philippe, 'I beseke ȝow þat ȝe wolle vochesaffe to send after myn̛

gerte Alexander send after Parmeny for to come vntiƚƚ hym, and gerte þe

Fra þeine kyng Alexander remowed̛ his Oste tiƚƚ hermony þe mare & onane

trauailed̛ many a day wit his Oste, and at þe last e come
tiƚƚ a cuntre wonder drye, & fuƚƚ of creuesceȝ of cauerneȝ, & alde

thurgℏ a cuntree, þat es called̛ Andrias, to þe Reuere of Eufrates. And
þare þay lugede þam̛. Þan Alexander garte brynge many grete treeȝ, for to
make a brygge of ouer þat water, appon̛ schippeȝ, and garte tye þam̛ Samen̛
wit chenys of Iren̛ & iren̛ nayleȝ. And when̛ þe brigge was aƚƚ redy, he
badde his knyghtes wende ouer apon̛ it. Bot whan̛ þay saw þe grete reuer
ryne so swiftely and with so a grate a byrre, thay dred þam̛ þat þe
brygge schulde faƚƚe. For þay supposede þe chenys schuld breke because
of grete weghte. And, when Alexander saw þam̛ dredand̛ on this wyse, he
gert hirdemen̛, þat were þare kepand̛ katell, wend̛ oner before, and
warnede þat þe Oste schulde folowe þam̛. Bot ȝit þe knyghtis ware ferde &

þe bryges, & aƚƚ his prynceȝ folowed̛ hym, and sythen̛ aƚƚ þe Oste. Twa
grete ryuers rynnes thurgℏ Medee, Mesopotamy and Babiloyne, þat es to

Alexander & aƚƚ hys Oste ware past ouer Eufrates, he gert smyte sonder
þe brygge þat he hadd̛ gert make bifore, and dissolue ilk a pece þareoff
fra oþer. And when his knyghtis sawe that, þay ware reghte heuy and
murnede gretly þarefore, and said̛ emanges þam selfe, 'What saƚƚ we now
doo,' quoþ þay, 'when we are harde bystadde wit oure enemys & walde
flee. For ouer þis reuere may we noȝte wyun̛.' And when Alexander
perceyued̛ þat murmoure of his folke, he said vnto þam̛. 'What es þat,'
quoþ he, 'þat ȝe say amangeȝ ȝow, "If it faƚƚe þat we flee owte of þe
bataile." Sothely, I late ȝow wele wite, þat þis is þe cause whi I garte
fordo þis brygg, þat I gert make; Forthi, þat owþer we schulde feghte

In þis mene tyme, kyng Darius gadirde a grete multitude of men̛ agaynes
Alexander, and ordeyned̛ ouer þam̛ fyvehundreth chyftaynes of
grete lordes and luged hym wit his men̛ apon̛ þe reuere of Tygre. And one
a day thir twa kynges wit þaire bather Ostes mett togedir apon̛ a faire

werre & ȝode to grounde thikkfalde, slayne in þe felde. And when̛ þe
remenante saw þat, þay tuk þam̛ to þe flighte. In Darius oste was a man̛
of Perse, a doghety, & a balde; to whaym Darius highte for to giffe his
doghter to wyfe, if so were, þat he myghte, by any way, sla kyng
Alexander. This man̛ gatt hym clethyng and Armour like vnto þe

kyng Alexander. And alson̛ als he come nere hym, he lifte his


      

swerde on heghte, & lete flye at hym̛ wit aƚƚ þe myghte þat he hade, and
hitt hym on þe heued̛ so fercely, þat he perched his bacenett, and drewe
þe blode of hym. When̛ Alexander knyghtis saw that: þay tuke hym anone, &
broghte hym bifore Alexander, and Alexander, supposyng þat he hadde bene
a macedoyne, saide vntill hym. 'Wirchipfuƚƚ man,' quoþ he, '& doghety &
strange what ayled þe at me, for to giffe suylke a strake, knewe þou
noȝte wele þat it was I, Alexander ȝour helpere & ȝour allere seruande.'
And  Percyene ansuerd̛, & said̛, 'Wiete þou wele wirchipfuƚƚ

this dede I didd̛. For kyng Darius made me a promysse of his doghetir to

wit this man̛. Sum̛ ansuerde & saide þam̛ thoghte it beste to gerre smyte
of his heid̛, Sum for to putt hym to þe fire for to brynne, Sum to gare

& said: 'Sirs,' quoþ he, 'what wrange or what defawte can̛ ȝe fynde in

and at his power fulfilled̛ it. Whilke of ȝow, so demeȝ hym worthy to be

if ȝe myȝte be getyn̛.' And þan he commanded̛ þat he schulde
wende hame to his felawes witowtten̛ any harme. When Darius herde þat
his lordes ware slayne in grete nowmer, he gadered̛ a grete multitude of
knyghtis and of fotemen̛, and went vp on a hiƚƚ þat es called̛ Taurisius,
and thare he made his mustre of his men̛, supposynge þat he schuld
ouercome Alexander thurgℏ multitude of folke. Bot alson̛ als þay mett wit
þaire bathere osteȝ, and bigan̛ for to fighte, Darius men̛ fledd̛ and

and þare he luged hym, and offerde Sacrafice tiƚƚ his goddeȝ. And on þe
morne he garte assaile þe


      

citee, and wanne it on werre. And in þe cheffe place þareof he sett his
trone. And aƚƚ þir oþer citeȝ þat were abowte it, he wann̛ þam̛ o werre, &
putt þam̛ vnder his subieccion̛. In þis ilke citee of Bactrian̛, he fande
tresour witowtten̛ nowmer, and also his moder, and his wyfe.

And in þe mene tyme, whils Alexander lay at Batran: þare come a prynce
of Darius oste vntiƚƚ Alexander, & said vntiƚƚ hym̛, 'Wirchipfuƚƚ

    'To Darius, grete kyng of kynges, his lordes whilke he hase ordeyned

    When̛ Darius had redde þis lettre, on ane he gert writte a lettir to

    ' Daryus kyng of Perse and kyng of kyngeȝ, vnto my seruande

When̛ Alexander hadd̛ redde þis lettre he wrate hym Anoþer agayne whareoff þe tenour was this.

    'Alexander þe son̛ of Philippe & qwene Olympias to Darius kyng of

Þis lettre gaffe Alexander to þe messangers of Darius and many grete

And when̛ Darius had redd̛ þis lettre, he sent in haste tiƚƚ Nostand, and
commanded̛ hym for tiƚƚ ordeyne a grete Oste; and manfully agaynestande
þe folke of Macedoyne. He sent also a lettre to Porus kyng of Ynde,
prayng hym to helpe hym agaynes Alexander, and Porus wrate agayne in þis
manere.

    ' Porus, kyng of Ynde, vnto Darius, kyng of Perse, gretyng. For þou

    late ȝow wite, þat witin schorte tym̛, we saƚƚ come for to helpe ȝow
    wit ten̛ legyouns of knyghtis.'

Bot when̛ Rodogorius, Darius moder, herd̛ teƚƚe þat Darius hir son̛
ordayned̛ hym for to feghte agayne wit kyng Alexander scho was riȝte sory
and wrote a lettre vntiƚƚ hym þat contened̛ this sentence.

    'To kyng Darius, hir moste biloued̛ son, Rodogorius, his modir sendeȝ
    gretyng & ioy. I hafe vnderstanden̛ þat ȝe hafe assemblede ȝour men̛,

    haffe in pesse þan þat at ȝe may halde, þan for too couett aƚƚ and
    be excluded̛ & forga aƚƚ.'

When̛ Darius redde þis lettre, he was gretly troubbled̛ and weped̛
bitterly, command̛ vntiƚƚ his mynde, his moder, his wyf, & his childer.

In the mene tyme kyng Alexander remowed̛ his oste, and drew nere þe cite
of Susis, in þe whilke Darius was lengand̛ the same tyme, so þat he myȝte
see aƚƚ þe heghe hilleȝ þat ware abownn̛ þe citee. Þan Alexander
commanded̛ aƚƚ his men̛, þat ilkan̛ of þam̛ suld cutte down̛e a brawnche of a
tree, and bere þam̛ furth wit þam̛ & dryfe bifore þam̛ aƚƚe manere of
besteȝ þat þay myȝte fynde in þe way. And when the Percyenes saw þam̛ fra
þe heghe hilleȝ þay wondred̛ þam gretly. And Alexander come wit his oste
to þe citee of Susis and luged hym nere besyde þe citee. And than̛ he
called̛ bis prynnceȝ & his oþer lordeȝ and said vnto þam̛, 'Late vs,'
quoþ he, ' send a messangere to kyng Darius & bidd̛ hym̛ owþer & com̛
feghte wit vs or eƚƚs submyt hym vntiƚƚ vs.' The nexte
nyghte after, Godd̛ Amon̛ apperede vntiƚƚ Alexander in his slepe bryngand̛
hym þe figurre of Mercuri & a mantiƚƚ, and anoþer manere of garment of
Macedoyne, and saide vntiƚƚ hym. 'Alexander, son̛,' quoþ hee, 'euer mare
when̛ þou hase nede, saƚƚ I helpe the. And þarefore luke þou sende noghte
to Darius þat messangere þat þou spake off. For I wiƚƚ þat þou thi selfe

perilous for to do, Dred þe na thynge, for I saƚƚ be thi helpe, so þat
þou saƚƚ hafe na maner of disesse.

On þe morne when̛ Alexander rase fra slepe, he was gretly comforthed̛ of
his dreme & called tiƚƚ hym his prynceȝ and talde þam̛ alle his dreme,
and þay assentede aƚƚe, þat he schulde wende to Darius in his propir
person. And onane he called̛ vntiƚƚ hym ane of þe princeȝ, þe whilke
highte Emulus. This


      

prynce was a wyghte man̛, & an hardy & wonder trewe tiƚƚ Alexander. And
þan̛ Alexander bad hym lepe one a horse, and brynge wit hym a noþer horse
& folow hym. And he didd̛ so. And when̛ þay come to gedir to þe water of
Graunte, þat in þe langage of Perse es called̛ Struma, þay fande it
frosen̛ ouer, and Alexander onane chaunged he wede, & lefte þe foresaid̛
prynce wit twa horse at þe watersyde and hym selfe, wit þe horse þat he
satt apon̛, went ouer þe water apon̛ þe Ysȝ, towarde þe citee of Susis.
And his prynce besoghte hym þat he walde suffre hym wende wit hym, ne
perauenture any disesse feƚƚe hym by þe waye. And Alexander ansuerd̛ &
sayde, 'Habyde me here,' quoþ he, 'For he saƚƚ be my helpere, wham̛ in
dremeȝ I sawe appere vnto me.' This ilke water I spake of bifore, aƚƚ
þe wynter seson ilke a nyghte was frosen̛ aƚƚ ouer; bot tymely in þe
mornynge als sone als þe warme son̛ smate apon̛ it, þan̛ it dissoluede
agayne, & ran̛ wonder swiftely; þe brede of þat water es þe space of a
furlange. When Alexander come to þe ȝate of þe citee the Perciens, when
þay saw hym, hadd̛ grete wonder of his figure, and wend̛ he hadd̛ bene a
godd̛, and onane þay asked̛ hym what he was ? And he ansuerd̛ and said̛ he
was a messangere sent fra kyng Alexander to þaire lorde Darius, and belyfe þay broghte hym til hym. Darius, when Alexander come bi fore hym,
said vntil hym. 'Whethyn̛ ert þou,' quoþ he ? 'I ame,' quoþ Alexander,
'sent vnto þe fra kyng Alexander to wiete where to þou taries to come
tiƚƚ hymu to gyffe hym bateƚƚe. Owthir come & feghte manfully wit thyne
enemys or eƚƚs submitte þe tiƚƚ hym̛ & pay hym tribute.'

And Darius heard him and said, ' Art thou then the Alexander who with
such madness shaped thy speech, for I see thou holdest thyself not from
words as a messenger doth, but art bold as a king. Yet know that by thy
words I am not frightened at all. Come dine with me this day.' And with
these words, he reached out his hand to him and took him by his right,
and led him into the palace. And Alexander, musing, began to say: 'A
right good token hath this barbarian wrought me when he clasped my right
hand and drew me into 


      

the palace, because, as the gods say sooth, ere long the palace shall be
mine.' And going in, Darius and Alexander lay by a table, and the
daintiest feast was laid out. And Darius' marshall gazed hard at
Alexander face to face. And the table was wreathed in cleanest gold. But
the Persians, seeing Alexander's shape, yet knew nothing of what wisdom,
doughtiness, and strength lurked in this small body. The dishes and
tables and seats were wrought of the finest gold. The cupbearers bore
cups in golden vessels and rarest jewels. And when a cup was handed to
Alexander, he hid it in his breast. And another cup was brought to him
and he did the same, and thus too with a third. And those who bore the
cups, seeing this, gave the news to the Emperor Darius. And he, hearing
of it, rose up; saying: 'Friend, what is this that thou doest, hiding
the cups in thy breast?' And Alexander: 'In our king's feasts the guests
are wont, whenever they will, to take their drinkingvessels. But, as
this seemeth to you unworthy, I will give them back forthwith.' And with
these words he gave them back to the cupbearers. But the Persians who
sate at the feast said each to each, 'a good custom, indeed, and one to
be praised.' And some lords, too, praised this way and exalted it. But
one of the Princes of Darius, called Anapolus, sitting at the feast,
gazed hard at Alexander and his face. For he had seen him when, at
Darius' bidding, he went into Macedonia to take tribute of Philip. He,
knowing his voice and looking on his face, began to think to himself and
say: 'Is this not Alexander?' And rising at once he drew near to Darius,
saying: 'This messenger whom thou beholdest is Alexander, the son of
Philip of Macedon.' And Alexander, seeing them with each other in talk,
knew they were speaking of him and he was known. And at this he rose up
from his place and leapt away from the board. And taking a blazing torch
from a Persian's hand, himself mounted his palfrey, which he found ready
outside Darius's palace, and fled in the swiftest flight. And the
Persian seeing this, taking weapons, mounted their steeds with a mighty
stir, and quickly followed after Alexander. And in the darkness of the
nightfall, they began to stray, some scratched their faces by the treeboughs, some falling into ditches. But Alexander, bearing his blazing
torch in hand, fared straight 


      

forward. Now, Darius sate on his throne and thought of Alexander and how
great his daring was. He saw a statue of gold of Xerxes the Persian
king, who sate below the highseat in the hall. And at once the statue
broke and was all scattered asunder. And Darius seeing this was smitten
with heaviness of heart and began to weep sorely and long. And he said:
'This foretokeneth the wasting of my life, and the utter downfall of the
Persian kingdom.' Alexander, however, coming to the river Grancus, found
it swollen, and leapt athwart it. But ere he was over the stream burst
its banks, and swept his horse away; with great hardship Alexander
escaped and met Eumulus, his lord. And thus he went back to his army and
told them of Darius, how he had dealt with him, and the torch with which
he had fled away. 


      HOW ALEXANDER PUT HEART INTO HIS HOST ANEW.

And on the following day, he gathered his army, which told two hundred
and twenty thousand of weaponed men. And he went up 

 on a hye place & comforthed his men̛ and said̛ vnto þam̛: 'Þe
multitude of þe percienes,' quoþ he, 'may noȝte be euend to þe multitude
of þe greckes. For sewrly we are ma þan þay. And if þay were ane
hundreth sythes maa then̛ wee, late noȝte ȝour hertis faile ȝow þarefore.
For I telle ȝow a grete multitude of flyes may do na harme till a fewee
waspes.' And when̛ þe Oste had herde thire wordes þay commendide hym
halelely wit a voyce.

Than̛ þe emperour Darius remowed̛ his oste, and come to þe reuere of
Graunt on þe nyghte, and went ouer on þe ysȝ, and þar he luged̛ hym. The
Oste of Darius was wonder grete and strange. For þay hadd̛ in þaire oste
X^m cartes ordaynd̛ For þe werre, and grete multitude of Olyfanteȝ, wit
towres of tree on̛ þam̛, stuffed̛ wit feghtyng men̛. And sone after appon̛ a
day thir twa kynges wit þaire osteȝ mett samen̛ on a faire felde, Darius
wit his men̛, and Alexander wit his men.


      

Than Alexender lept apon̛ his horse, þat highte Buctiphalas, and rade
furthe bifore aƚƚ his oste, and houed in þe myddes waye bitwene þe twa
ostes. And when̛ þe Percyenes saw hym, þa had grete wonder of hym, and
ware riȝte ferde for hym, by cause he was so vggly. Neuereþelesse þay
tromped̛ vp & went towarde Alexander. And sone þe bateƚƚ ioyned, &
faghte togedir fersely, and many men̛ dyed̛ on ayther party; þare was so
thikke schott of arowes, þat þe ayer was couerde, as it had bene wit a
clowde. Some faghte wit swerdeȝ, sum wit speres, sum wit axes, & sum̛ wit
arowes. Þe felde lay fuƚƚ of folke, sum̛ dede, sum̛ halfedede, & sum̛
greuously wonded̛. Thay began̛ for to feghte at þe son̛rysynge, and faghte
to þe son̛settyng. Bot þare dyed̛ many ma of þe percyenes þan þare dide
of Macedoyns.

And when̛ Darius sawe his men̛ faƚƚe so thikke in þe felde, he lefte þe
felde, and fledd, and þe percyenes seyng that, þay fledd̛ also. Bot þan̛
þaire cartes of werre rane amange þe percyens & slewe of þam̛ folke witowte nouwmer & namely of fotemen̛. For by þat tyme it was myrke nyghte,
and þay ne myȝte noȝte see for tiƚƚ eschewe þam̛. When̛ Darius come to the foresaid̛ watere he fande it frosen̛, and ouer he went. And
when̛ he was ouer, þe oþer lordes of perse went appon̛ þe ysȝ, so grete a
multitude þat þay couerde þe ysȝ fra þe taa banke to þe toþer, & þat a
grete brede, & þan̛ onane þe ysȝ brake als sone als Darius was paste
ouer, & aƚƚ þat ware on þe ysȝ ware perischte, ilk a moder son̛, &
drownede in þe water. Þe remanaunt, when̛ þay come to the water, þay
myȝte noȝte wyn̛ ouer. And þan̛ þe Macedoynes come, & dange þam̛ downe. In
this bateƚƚe þare was slaen of þe percyenes CCC^m witowten̛ thase þat
were drownned.

Kyng Darius fledd̛ to þe citee of Susis, & went in tiƚƚ his palace, &
feƚƚe downe to þe grounde, & sigheand & wepande wit a sare hert, he said̛
theis wordes: 'Allas, fuƚƚ wa es me, vnhappye wriche, þat euer I was
borne, for þe ire & þe indignacionn̛ of heuen̛ es fallen̛ one mee. For I

he hade saide thir wordes, he rase vp, & satt & wrate a lettre vntill
Alexander, sayande on this wyese.

    'Tiƚƚ his lorde Alexander, kyng of Macedoyne, Darius, kyng of Perse,

    kingsbip of the Medes and Persians, that thus ye may have and keep
    what victory Jove the allmighty hath granted you.'


      


      HOW THE MESSENGERS OF DARIUS GAVE ALEXANDER THE LETTER, AND HIS
      ANSWER.

The messengers of Darius coming then to Alexander gave him the letter,
which Alexander read soon before them all. Then one of his chieftains,
called Parmerion, said to Alexander: 'Most mighty emperor, take all the
wealth which Darius covenants unto thee, and give back to him his wife
and sons.' And, hearing this, Alexander called to him the messengers of
Darius, and before all spoke thus, saying: 'Tell ye to your emperor we
wonder first that he misdeemed his mother, wife, and sons to be betrayed
by our hands. If he be overcome, bid him not promise us a reward. If he
bow himself to our yoke, all his honours and the majesty of God shall be
laid bare to our sway. If he be not overcome, let him do us battle once
again.' This said, he gave them rich gifts and sent them forth away.
Then he bade the soldiers take up and gather the bodies of the dead and
bury them in graves: and he bade them heal those that were wounded.



      HOW ALEXANDER ENCAMPED BY THE STREAM GRANCUS.

Then he encamped with his host by the stream of Grancus, and wintered
there some days. And there he offered up victims to the gods. And about
the river there were palaces, and they were the fairest, raised up with
greatest skill, and Xerxes the King of the Persians had built them.
Alexander, seeing them, bade them be burned. And soon after this,
stirred by ruth, he gave word none should dare touch them. And there too
was a most fair and very wide field in which the Kings and Deemsters of
Persia were of old buried. And digging into this field the Macedonians
found in the graves gemmed vases. And there they found the grave of
Ninus the King of Assyria and Persia, which was hollowed out of a single
amethyst, and engraven on the outside with palmleaves and sundry kinds
of birds. And so bright was the amethyst that even from the outside the
man's body appeared whole. And in this place was a narrow and evil tower
on which stood many men, some with cut legs, some with broken thighs,
some with torn hands, and some blinded. They hearing 


      

the noise of the armed men cried out to Alexander, who bearing their
cries, bade them be taken thence. And seeing them was struck with ruth
and wept, and bade each one be given ten thousand drachmas, and be
restored every one to his own. For Darius kept them in prison, since
they were of noble birth, and awarded all their possessions to his
thralls. In the meantime the messengers from Alexander to Darius told
all that Alexander had said. And Darius hearing this began to get ready
for the fight. And he wrote another letter to Porus King of India, which
runneth as follows: 

THE LETTER SENT BY DARIUS TO PORUS KING OF INDIA.

'Darius King of the Persians to Porus King of Our Indians joy. We asked
but lately of you, and again we ask you to come and help against those
who strive to overthrow our palace. We know well also that the like harm
will light on you. For this Alexander, who fighteth thus, hath an
unquenchable and wild soul, which like a lion ceaseth not, and is like
the sea when stirred by mighty winds. Furthermore, unwillingly though it
be, we have gathered numberless races, and we have taken our counsel to
fight with him to the very death. better vs es for

dissolacion̛ of oure rewme. Wharefore, hafand̛ reward̛ and compassion̛ of
oure disesse, we beseke ȝow, þat ȝe late oure prayeres satteƚƚ in ȝour

þe grete noblaye of oure progenytours. And I seure ȝow þat 
giffe ilke a foteman̛ þat comeȝ wit ȝow, thre peceȝ of golde, And ilke a

ȝe wele for certayne, that riȝte als he done tiƚƚ vs, so he purpose hym
in tyme commynge for to do to ȝowe.'

In the men tyme, certane men̛ of Darius went fra hym & come tiƚƚ
Alexander, & talde hym, þat Darius purposede hym for to feghte wit hym
eftesones, and had sent tiƚƚ Porus, kyng of Inde, for to come in grete
haste, for to helpe hym. When̛ Alexander herd þis, belyfe he remowed̛ his
Oste to ward̛ Darius, thynkand in his herte þat he wolde on na wyse take
apon̛ hym þe name of Emperour before he hadd̛ wonn̛ Darius and his rewme
one werre. And when Darius herde of þe commyng of Alexander, he dredd̛
hym gretly & þe percyenes also. Bot þare was two prynceȝ of Darius, of
þe whilke þe tane highte Bisso & þe toþer Ariobarsantes, thir twa when̛
þair herd̛ of þe comyng of Alexander, conspyred̛ togedir for to slaa þaire
lord̛ Darius, supposyng for tiƚƚ hafe a grete thanke of Alexander, and a
gret reward̛ for þaire dede. And ayther of þam̛ ware sworne tiƚƚ oþer. And
than̛ thay went to þe kynges palace, and come intiƚƚ his chamber wit
drawen̛ swerdes in þaire handeȝ, and fand Darius bi hym ane. And when̛
Darius saw that, he trowed̛ wele þat þay wolde sla hym̛, And said vnto
þam̛: 'Dere frendeȝ, hedir to wardeȝ hafe I called ȝow my seruaundeȝ, bot
now I call ȝow my lordes. What ayles ȝow at me þat ȝe wiƚƚ sla me ? Haes
Alexander cheriste þe macedoynes mare þan̛ I hafe done ȝow? Hafe I noȝte
sorow & disese ynoghe of enemyse witowtten̛ ? Bot if ȝe conspire agaynes
me for to sla me wit owtten̛ gilt, I say for sothe, & ȝe sla me thus preuelye, And Alexander may gete ȝow, he wiƚƚ take mare crueƚƚ

mercy, thurgℏ his wordeȝ, Bot went tiƚƚ ℏym and wit grete cruelnesse
smate hym, & alto magle hym, and went faste þaire waye, & lefte hym for
dede.

And when̛ Alexander herd̛ teƚƚ þat Darius was slayne he


      

went ouer þe water of Graunt, and aƚƚ his Oste wit hym, and come to þe
cetee of Susis. And alsone als þe percyenes saw hym, Thay Opened þe
ȝates of þe citee, & rescheyued̛ hym̛ wit grete wirchipe. And when̛ þe
prynceȝ þat slewe Darius wiste þat Alexander was comen̛ in̛to þe citee
þay went & helde þam̛ in hidils ay tiƚƚ þay myȝte gete knaweynge of
Alexander wiƚƚ, as towchand̛ þat that þay hadd̛ done to Darius. Alexander
þan̛ went into þe kynges Palace, and as he went þarein he merueyled hym
gretly of þe biggyng þareoff. For Cirus þe kyng of Perse gert bigg it
ryally. And the pament þareoffe was made of stanes of dyuerse colours, &
þe walles aƚƚ enueround wit fyne golde & precyous stanes & sternes lyke
to þe firmament, and pelers of golde þat bare vp þe werke. When̛
Alexander saw aƚƚ this curious werke, he meruailed̛ hym gretly. And than̛
he went to þe chambre þare Darius laye halfe dede. And alsone als he saw
hym̛ he hadd̛grete rewthe & compassion̛ of hym, and he tuke off his awenn̛
mantiƚƚ & couerd̛  þarewit, & went and graped̛ his wondes and wepid̛
for hym riȝt tenderly, & said̛ until hym. 'Rise vp, sir Darius,' quoþ
he, '& be of gude comforthe. And als frely as euer þou reioysede thyn̛

sir, what þay are þat hase thus faren̛ wit the, and I sewre þe als I am

had said̛ this & mekiƚƚ mare, Sare wepand̛ Darius putt furthe his hande,
and layde his arme abowte Alexander nekke, and kyssed his breste, his
nekke, & his hande, & saide thir wordeȝ, thare that here folowes. 'A,

swelt in Alexander armes. Kyng Alexander, þan̛, after þe custom̛ was for

wit aƚƚ þe solempnyte and wirchipe þat myghte be done, he helped hym

noȝte allanly for þe dede of Darius, bot for petee of þaire hertis, þat
þay saw Alexander wepe so enterely. And when̛ Darius was beried̛ Alexander
went agayne to þe palace.

And one þe morne Alexander went and sett hym in a trone aƚƚ of golde &
precyous stanes, the whilke Cyrus sumtyme gert make þat was
kynge of Perse. And the Macedoynes and þe Persyenes sett apon̛ his hede a

of precious stanes, & ofþe sege þareoffe was vii seuen̛ cubeteȝ heghe
fra þe grounde, and a grece of seuen̛ greeȝ was made


      

þareto, whareby kynges ascended þareto. And thir greeȝ were mede
wonder craftyly & curyously. The firste gree was of ane amatist. The
seconde gree was of a Smaragd̛. The thredd̛ gree was of a Topaȝ. The
ferthe gree was of a granat. The fifte was of ane adamand̛. The sext was
of fyn̛ golde. And the seuennt was of clay. And thay ware noȝt wtten̛ grete causeȝ ordeyned̛ one þis wyse.

For þe first gree wne amatist, for amange aƚƚ oþer stanes it hase
this vertu, that it represses & haldeȝ donne þe fumositee of wyne & þe
myghte þareoffe, & suffers noȝte a man̛ þat bere it on̛ hym be troubbled̛

solde ilke a kyng be of perfite witt & mynde, & thurgℏ nane occasion̛ do

whilk passeȝ aƚƚ manere of precious stanes in reedness: & betakens þat a

The fifte was of ane Adamande. Þe Adamande es so harde þat it may noȝte
be broken̛ nowþer with yren̛ ne wit stane, bot if it firste be enoynted̛
wit gayte blode. On þe same wyse a kyng suld be of so grete constance &

riȝte as gold̛ passeȝ all maner of metaƚƚe in bewtee, & in precioustee;
riȝte so a kyng awe to be preferred̛ before oþer men̛ & gouernours of þam̛.
 Þe seuent was of Clay, tiƚƚ þat entent þat a man̛ þat es
raysed vp to þe dingnyte of a kyng sulde alway vmbythynk hym þat he was
made of erthe, & at þe laste


      

to þe erthe he saƚƚ agayne. When̛ Alexander was sett apon̛ this trone,
coronnde wit his diademe, & þe Macedoynes & þe persenes standyng abowte
hym: before þam̛ aƚƚe he gert write a lettre tiƚƚ aƚƚ cuntreeȝ, þat was
of this tenour.

    'Alexander the son̛ of godd̛ Amon̛ & qwene Olympias kyng of kynges &
    lorde of lordes, tiƚƚ aƚƚe Dukes, Prynceȝ, Erles, Baronns, maisters,
    & tiƚƚ aƚƚ þe folkeȝ of Perse: ioy & grace. Sen̛ it es plesynge to
    godd, þat I sitt one þe trone of Darius, & be lorde of þe persyenes,
    grete cause I hafe for to be reioyist gretely þareoffe, ne were it
    for þe gret multitude of folke þat ere slayne. Bot sen̛ it so es þat
    godd̛ hase ordeynede me to be ȝour lorde, and ȝour gouernour, þare    fore we commande ȝow þat in ilke a citee, thurghowte þe lordchipe of
    Perse, ȝe ordeyne prynceȝ and gouernours as þare was in Darius tyme,
    to þe whilke we commande ȝow þat ȝe be obeyande as ȝe beforetymes
    hafe bene, and that þay do riȝte tiƚƚ ilke a man̛ at þaire powere.
    Also it es oure wiƚƚ and oure commandement, þat ilke a man̛ welde &
    reioyse paysabily his landes and his possessiouns. We commande
    alsoo, þat fra this lande of perse vntiƚƚ Ellada, & fra thethyn̛ to

    bathe in and owte, wit merchandyse or any oþer erandes þat þay hafe
    at do, and Joy & pese be vnto ȝowe.'

Þan gert Alexander aƚƚ men̛ be stiƚƚ, and said one this wyse: 'Whilke of
ȝow so slew myn̛ enemy Darius; comeȝ forthe befor me, and I shaƚƚ giffe
ȝow worthy mede, & conable wirchipe do þam̛, I swere bi oure goddeȝ þat
ere Almyȝty, & bi my moste biloved̛ moder Olympias, þat I saƚƚ gyffe þam̛
worthy mede.' When̛ Alexander had saide thir wordes þe persyenes wepede
wonderly sare. And than̛ þe twa man̛morthireres Bisso and Aryobarȝantes
come bifore Alexander, and sayde vntiƚƚ hym: 'Wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,'
quoþ þay, 'we ere thase þat slew Darius thyne enemy wit oure Awenn̛
hende.' And when̛ Alexander saw þam̛, he bade his knyghtes belyfe ga &
take þam̛, & bynde þam, & lede þam̛ to Darius grafe, & þare smyte
of þaire heuedes, And than̛ þay ansuerd̛, & saide vntiƚƚ Alexander: 'A,
A, wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,' quoþ þay,


      

'swore þou noȝte tiƚƚ vs, bi oure goddeȝ þat ere Almyȝty, & bi þe hele
of thi moder Olympias, þat þou solde gerre do vs na harme, bot þat þou
solde giff vs a worthi reward̛.' And Alexander saide agayne vnto þam̛:
'So aughte me wele for to swere, for to gette knawyng of þe slaers of
Darius. For I solde neuer hafe getyn̛ knawyng þareoffe had I noȝte
sworne so. And ȝitt I saƚƚ safe myn̛ athe wele ynoghe. For it was alway
myn̛ entent, þat if I myȝte wete what þay ware, þay solde hafe swilke a

hafe na conscience to sla anoþer man̛.' And when þe perseyenes herde this
þay bygan̛ to prayse Alexander & to commende hym and blysse hym as he
had bene a godd̛. Þan̛ kyng Alexander gert hede tha twa homycydes. And aƚƚ
þe rewme he sett in gouernance of certayne lordes. Amanges oþer þare was
ane alde lorde was eme to Darius, þe whilke highte Climitus, þat was
gretly luffede wit þe persyenes; And Alexander at þe request of aƚƚ the
persyenes ordeyned hym for to be chefe goueruour vnder hym of aƚƚ perse.
And one þe morne Alexander sett hym in his trone, wit his coroun̛ on his
hede, and efter þe biddynng of Darius he commande to brynge bifore hym
Rosan̛, Darius doghter, wit a coroun̛ on̛ hir hede, sett fuƚƚ of precious
stanes. And þare, as þe maner was of þe persyenes, he tuke hir to his
wyfe, and made hir to sitt wit hym in his trone & command aƚƚ men̛ to
wirchipe hir als quene. And þan̛ þe persyenes were wonderly glade, &
onane þay broȝte þaire goddeȝ bifore Alexander, and bigan̛ to wirchipe
hym, & loue hym riȝte als he hade bene a godd̛, and said̛ vntill hym,
hallely wit a voyce, 'þou thi selfe es a godd̛, For that þat es plesande
tiƚƚ oure goddes alway þou dose.' And when̛ Alexander saw this, he was
gretly troubled & riȝte ferde & said̛ vnto þam 'Wirchipfuƚƚ sirs,' quoþ
he, 'I pray ȝow þat ȝe wirchipe me noȝte as a godd̛, for sothely I am as
ȝe are, a corupteble & a dedly man̛, and in me þare es na parceƚƚ of the
godhede. And þarefore, I beseke ȝow, cesseȝ of this wirchipe þat ȝe do me'

Þan gert Alexander write a lettre tiƚƚ Olympias his moder & tiƚƚ
Arestotle his maister, makand mencyon̛ of aƚƚ þe batayƚƚs & þe disesseȝ
þat he hadd̛ suffred in Perse, and of þe grete reches


      

þat he fande þare, of þe whilke he & aƚƚ his men̛ ware made riche. And
also he wrate vnto þam̛, þat þay scholde make grete
solempnytee lastyng aghte dayes because of þe weddynge of Alexander &
Rosan̛ Darius doghter. And so did̛ Alexander, in Perse, wit þe maceydoynes
& þe persyenes, many a daye.

Affter this kyng Alexander sembled̛ a grete Oste, bathe of macedoyns & of
persyenes, and went towarde Inde for to werre apon̛ Porus, kyng of Inde,
þe whilke ordeynede hym for to come & helpe kyng Darius. And, when
Alexander was entered intiƚƚ Inde, he went thurgℏ wildernes & waste
cuntree, whare in ware grete reuers and many grete caues & cauernes. And
þan̛ Alexander & his men̛ wex wery, & irkede riȝte sare. And þe prynces Of
macedoyne & of grece murmourede amangeȝ þam̛ gretly, & saide ilkan̛ tiƚƚ
oþer: 'It myȝte hafe sufficed̛ tiƚƚ vs, þat we hafe ouersett kyng

For werre & debate unrescheȝ his body so fer furth þat, and he ristede

went and stodde in ane heghe place amangeȝ þam̛, & sayde one this wise:
'Departis ȝow in twaa, so þat þe persyenes be by þam̛selfe and þe
Macedoynes and þe grekes bi þam̛selfe.' And when̛ þay hadd̛ so done,
Alexander saide to þe Macedoynes and þe grekes: 'A A, myne owenn̛ dere
knyghtis,' quoþ he, 'wele  knawe þat thir persyenes, vnto þis day,
hase bene contrary & rebeƚƚes vnto ȝow & to me, and ȝe wiƚƚ now lefe me

And I by myn̛ ane was þe firste man̛ þat entrede þe batayƚe. And ȝitt
moreouer, as ȝe wele wate, I tuke apon̛ me for to be ȝoure allere

When̛ Alexander had said̛ þus, aƚƚ þe prynceȝ of Macedoyne and of þe

this wyse: 'Moste wirchipfuƚƚ emperour, oure lyfe lyes hallely in ȝour

þare mette hym þe embassatours of Porus kyng of Inde, and broghte hym

    ' Porus kyng of Inde: vnto þe theeffe Alexander, þat thurgℏ thifte

When̛ þis lettre was comen̛ tiƚƚ Alexander, he gerte rede it before aƚƚ

When̛ Porus hadd̛ this lettre, he was wondere wrathe & assemblede a grete

Fra thethyn̛, Alexander remowede his Oste & come to þe ȝates of Caspee,

þareIn many maners of nedders and of wilde besteȝ. Fra þeine
Alexander sent a lettre tiƚƚ Talifride quene of Amaȝon̛, of þis tenour.

    ' Kyng of kynges, and lorde of lordes, Alexander, þe son̛ of godd̛

And vnto this lettre Talifride made ansuere by lettre one this wyse.

When̛ Alexander hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, he began̛ to lawghe. And onane he
garte writte anoþer lettre, and sent it to Talyfride, whareoffe þe

    'Alexander kyng of kynges and of lordeȝ, the son̛ of godd̛ Amon̛ & þe

And when̛ þe Amaȝons hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, þay went to conseƚƚ, and
thoghte it was beste for to ascent vntiƚƚ hym. And þan̛ þay sent hym x

went hame agayne, wonder glade and blythe.

In þe mene tyme it was talde Alexander, þat Porus, þe kyng of Inde, was
in Bactricen̛, and assembled̛ a grete Oste for to feghte eftsonns wit hym.
And when̛ Alexander herde this, he remowede his Oste, and chese owte c.l

and to lede þam̛ seurly thurgh þat strange cuntree. In þe Monethe of

And thay went thurgℏ a dry cuntree, sandye, & witowtten̛ water. And

did̛. And þan̛ aƚƚ þe Oste schane riȝte as it had̛ bene sternes, for sum of
þaire armours ware of golde, sum̛ of siluer, and sum̛ of precious stanes.
And when̛ Alexander saw þe araye of his Oste, and þaire baners bifore
þam̛ Schynande so faire, he was riȝte gladde. Neuerþeles grete disese
he hadd̛, þat nowþer he, ne his men̛, myȝte fynde na water.


      

So it feƚƚe þat a knyghte of Macedoyne þat hyȝte ȝephilus fand̛ water
standynge in an holle stane, þat was gadird̛ þare of þe dewe of þe heuen̛,
the whilke þis forsaide knyghte putt in his Bacenett, & broȝthe it till
Alexander for to drynke. And Alexander saide untiƚƚ hym, 'I suppose,'
quoþ he, 'þat I drynke þis water, saƚƚ þe Macedoynes & þe persyenes be
any thynge refreschede þareby, or I saƚƚ hafe aƚƚ þe refreschyng be my

intiƚƚ a flux, and slewe a grete hepe of þam. For þat water was wonder
scharpe, and als bittire als any mekiƚƚ gyrse. Bot þan̛ was Alexander

He hadd̛ also in his Oste ccc^m horse men̛ and muyles & camelles witowten̛

namely for þe disese þat his Oste suffrede.


      

And̛ as þay went endlande þis reuere, abowte þe viii houre of þe day, þay
come tiƚƚ a casteƚƚ þat stode in a littiƚƚ Ile in þis forsaid̛ ryuere;
Aud this casteƚƚ was made of þe forsaid̛ redeȝ. Þe brede of this ryuer
was foure furlange lentℏ. And in þat casteƚƚ þay sawe a few men̛. And þan̛
Alexander bad his men̛ spirre þam̛ þat ware in þe casteƚƚ in þe langage of
Inde whare þay myghte fynde any swete watir able for to drynke. And also
son̛ als þay spake to þam̛ þay withdrewe þam̛ & hidd̛. And Alexander gerte
schotte arowes into þe casteƚƚ and þan̛ þay hidd̛ þam̛ wele þe mare. And
when Alexander saw that þay walde one na wyse speke wit hym, he
hadd̛ a certane of his knyghtes nakne þam & swyme ouer þe water to þe
casteƚƚ. And þan̛ xxxvii balde knyghtis & hardy of Macedoyne nakned̛ þam̛,
and tuke ilkan̛ of þam̛ a swerde in his hande & went into þe water &
swame it to þay were passede þe fertbe parte þareoffe. And sodeynly
thare rase oute of þe water a grete multitude of besteȝ, þat ere called̛
ypotaynes, grettere of body than̛ an̛ olypℏant, and deuored̛ thir knyghtis
euerilkanne. And þan̛ was Alexander riȝte sare greuede, and belyfe
garte take þe forsaid̛ guydeȝ cl & caste þam̛ into þe water. And onane þe
ypotaynes deuored̛ þem.

And Alexander thoghte it was noȝte spedfuƚƚ langare to stryffe wit thase

so aƚƚ þat day wondere wery for thriste. And also þay hadd̛ grete disese
& nuye of wilde Beste þat come apon̛ þam̛, þat es to say, of lyones,

And as þay went on̛ þis wyse wit grete angere & disese aboute þe elleued̛
houre þay saw a littiƚƚ bate in þe riuere made of rede and men̛ rowande

myȝte fynde any fresche water. And þay talde whare & schewed̛ þam̛ a place
a littiƚƚ þeine wharein þay saide þay scholde fynde a grete staunke of

Alexander comanded̛ þat þay sulde feƚƚe

many fires in þe Oste, and gerte trompe to þe mete. Ald alson̛ þe mone
began̛ to schynne þare come a grete multitude of scorpyons towarde þe
stanke for to take þam̛ a drynke. And þan̛ þare come oþer manere of
nedders, and dragones wonder grete of dyuerse colours. And aƚƚ þat
cuntree resounned̛ of þe noyse & þe hissȝingeȝ þat þay made. Þir dragones
come dounne fra þe hye mountaynes for to drynke of þe stanke, and þay

Alexander & his Oste saw þam̛ þay ware riȝt fered̛ for þam̛.
For þay wende þay schulde hafe weried̛ þam̛ ilkan̛. And þan̛ Alexander
comforthed̛ þam̛ and saide vnto þam̛: 'Mi wirchipfuƚƚ knyghtes,' quoþ he,
'bees noȝte agaste of þam̛, bot does ilkane as ȝe see me do.' And þan̛ he
tuk a nett & sett it bitwixe hym & þam̛ and tuke his schelde & his spere

gretly comforthed̛ & belyfe tuke þaire wapynneȝ & didd̛ als þay sawe

gretly disesed. Þan̛ comanded̛ Alexander þat þay schuld̛ make many fyres

in his frunte three lange hornes. And he was schapen̛ lyke a horse & he
was aƚƚ blakke. And þis beste was called̛ in þe langage of Inde
'Anddontrucion̛'. And or he went to þe water at drynke, he assailled̛ þe
Oste. Bot Alexander went here & þare amangeȝ þe oste & comforthed̛ þam̛.
This ilke beste slewe of his knyghtes xxviij and bare donne lij and at
þe laste it feƚƚe in þe nettis and was slayne. After þis þare come oute

Of sum̛ þay bate offe þe nese; of sum þe eres. In þe mornenynge arely

went to þe stankesyde & drewe fisches & eleȝ oute of þe water, & ete þam̛.

Þhan̛ lefte Alexander þir perilous placeȝ, and come wit his Oste, into
þe cuntree of Bactricen̛, þe whilke was fuƚƚ of golde & oþer reches. And
þe men̛ of þe cuntree resayfed̛ hym benyngly & wirchipfully and gaffe hym

folkeȝ of þe cuntree gaderd̛ & made clathe þareoffe. Þe knyghtes of
Alexander wex wonder balde & strange of hert because of þe victoryes þay

Fra thethyn, Alexander remowed̛ his Oste and come to þe place whare Porus
lay wit þe folke þat he hadd̛ assembled̛. And one þe morne bathe Alexander
and Porus tuke þaire grounde & arayed̛ þaire bateƚƚs for to feghte. And than̛


      

Alexander lepped apon̛ his horse Buktiphalas and went bifore his Oste &
þan̛ þay trumpede up & þe bateƚƚs joyned̛ samen̛, & faghte togedir riȝte
sare. Bot þe Indienes feƚƚ thikfalde in þe bateƚƚ as corne dose in þe

sitteȝ noȝte tiƚƚ an emperour,' quoþ he, 'to lose his men̛ þus in vayne.
Bot it sitteȝ tiƚƚ hym for to determyne his cause with his awenn̛ handeȝ.
And þarefore late thi folke stand stiƚƚ on þe ta syde, & myn̛ on þe toþer

said Porus dispysand̛ Alexander, bicause þat he was a man̛ of littiƚƚ

knawande þe vertu & þe hardnes þat was hidd̛ in Alexander.
And than bathe þe ostes stode stiƚƚ ant lete þe twa kyngeȝ feghte samen̛,
Porus gaffe Alexander a grete strke on̛ þe hede, & was in poynte to

Porus tourned̛ hym to þam̛warde for to reproue þam̛ for þaire schowttyng.
And Alexandsr went tiƚƚ hym manfully & tuke his swerd̛ in bathe his

And when̛ þe Indienes saw that þay bigan scharply for to fighte wit

quoþ he, 'wharto feghte ȝe sen̛ ȝour kynge es dede. Wate ȝe noȝte wele

quoþ þay, 'fighte manfully, and dye in the felde, þan̛ for to see þe

herde thir wordes þay keste fra þam̛ þaire wapyneȝ & thanked̛ Alexander
and wirchiped̛ him riȝte als he hadd̛ bene a godd̛. Than kyng Alexander

Fra thethyn̛ Alexander remowed̛ his Oste & come tiƚƚ a cuntree þat was

     'The coruptible Gumnosophist vntiƚƚ Alexander a man̛ wee

When̛ Alexander had radd̛ this lettre he sent ane ansuere agayne on̛ this

And þan̛ he wente into þe cuntree whare þay duelled̛. And he saw þam̛ ga

Anoþer day, he come wit his Oste tiƚƚ a place wharee twa ymageȝ ware, þe

hafe passede ouer this ryuere, þay myȝte noȝte be cause it was riȝte
brade and fuƚƚ of dragones and oþer monstres.

Fra thethin þay went aboute towardeȝ þe lefte party of Inde and come
till a dry Marras fuƚƚ of gret redeȝ. And as þay passed thurgh þat
Marras, belyue þare come owte of þe redeȝ a beste lyke ane ypotayne,
whase breste was lyke to þe cocadriƚƚe, and his bakke lyk a sawe, and
his tethe wonder grete, & als scharpe as a suerde; bot in his gangyng he was


      

als slaw als a snyle. And, in his oute  come, he slew twa knyghtis of
Alexander. This ilke beste myȝte þay on na wyse perche wit þaire speres.
Bot wit mellis of yren̛ þay slew it.

And fra þeine þay trauelde thritty day iourneȝ and come to þe vttermaste
iles of Inde, & þare þay luged̛ þam̛ besideȝ a ryuere þat es callede in
þat langage of Inde Hemmahurer. And aboute þe Eleuend̛ houre þar come
owte of þe woddeȝ a grete multitude of Olyphanteȝ & come apon̛ þam̛ wit a

Buktiphalas and busked̛ hym agaynes þam̛ and badd̛ þe macedoynes þat þay
solde tak þaire horse and ilk a man̛ a swyne in a bande, & wende agaynes

þaire groyneȝ redy te tak þam̛. And when̛ þe Macedoynes saw þat þay ware
fered̛ and durste noȝte go to þam̛. And Alexander saide vnto þam, 'My

nathynge. For, and ȝe wiƚƚ gare ȝoure swyne crye faste ȝe
schall see aƚƚ þir Olyphantes flee anon̛.' And alsone als þe Olyphantes
herde þe crye of þe swyne, and þe noyse of þaire trompes, þay fledd̛ and
durste noȝte habyde. And Alexander & his men̛ pursued̛ tham̛, and what wit
nettis, whatt wit swerdes & speres, þay slewe of þam̛ a grete multitude,
and come agayne to thaire tentis.

Anoþer day þay removed̛ þeine, and trauelde thurgℏ the same woddeȝ of
Inde. And þay fande þare women̛ with berdis rechande downn̛ to þaire
pappes, & þaire heuedeȝ playne abownne, and þay ware cledd̛ aƚƚ in

tiƚƚ Alexander. And he gart spirre þam in the langage of Inde, how þay
liffed in thase woddes, whare na duellyng was of men̛. And þay ansuered̛ &
said, 'We lyffe aƚƚ,' quoþ þay, 'wit venyson̛ þat we take in thir woddes
thurgℏ huntynge.'

When̛ þay ware passed̛ oute of thir woddeȝ þay come intiƚƚ a faire felde
vntiƚƚ a place whare this forsaid̛ riuere ran̛. And þare þay fande bath
men̛ & women̛ aƚƚ naked. And þay ware


      

als rugℏe of hare as þay hade bene bestes. Whase kynde & custom̛ it was
als wele to be in þe water, als on̛ þe lande. And als sone als þay saw
Alexander Oste onane þay fledd̛ to þe water, and dowked intill it. Fra
þeine þay traueld̛ xv day iournee, and entred̛ intiƚƚ woddes þat ware
fuƚƚ of cynocephals, þe whilke als son̛ als þay saw Alexander & his oste

wit speres & nettes slew a grete multitude of þam̛, and þe remenaunt of
þam̛ fledd̛ here and thare in þe woddeȝ.

Fra thethyn̛ þay went fourty dayes & come intiƚƚ a champaynne cuntree,
þat was aƚƚ Barayne, and na hye place ne na hilles myghte be sene on na

tentis & þaire luges. And þare was grete disese ymang þe oste. For þe
wynde tuk firebrandes oute of fyres þat þay hadd̛ made, and smate
dyuerse men̛ & brynte þam̛. And þan̛ Alexander knyghtes mournurede gretly &
said amangeȝ þam, 'Þe wrethe & þe wreke of oure goddeȝ,' quoþ þay,
'falleȝ apon̛ vs, Bicause we seke to ferre towarde þe son̛ rysynge.' 'My

wrethe of oure goddes bot because of equinox of heruest.' When̛ þe wynde
was cessed̛ þay gadirde tegedir þat þe wynd̛ hadd̛ sparpled̛.

Fra þeine þay went xxv days and come intiƚƚ a grene valay, and þare þay
luged̛ þam̛. Than commanded̛ Alexander þat þay schuld make many fyres. For
it began̛ for to be vnsufferable calde. And thare began for to falle
grete flawghtis of snawe, as þay had bene grete lokkes of woƚƚe. When̛
Alexander saw that, he was ferde þat it schuld̛ noȝte hafe cessed̛ sone,
aud bad his men̛ þat þay suld tred doun̛ þe snawe & fuƚƚ it wit þaire

fyve hundrethe of þe Oste dedd̛ thurghþat snawe, þe whilk Alexander gart
bery. Þan̛ þare felle a passand̛ grete rayne, and þe snaw cessed. Wit þe
rayne, also, þare come so thikke a myste, þat contenually three days to

bad his knyghtis put alde ryuen̛ clatheȝ wate bifore þe fire, and he

Fra thethin, þay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a grete ryuere þat es called̛
Ganges & þare þay luged þam̛. And as þay luked̛ ouer on the toþer syde,
þay saw twa or thre men̛ walke up & downn̛ þare. And Alexander badd̛ his
men̛ spirre þam̛ in þe langage of Inde what þey ware. And þay ansuered̛ &
said̛. 'We are Bragmayns,' quoþ þay. Alexander hadd̛ grete desyre to speke
wit þe Bragmayns. Bot he myȝte noȝte wynn̛ ouer þe water; it was so depe

also it was fuƚƚ of ypotaynes & scorpyones and cocadrilles, out taken̛ in

couerde it wit nowtte hydis & gerte pykk it wele bathe witin & witowtten̛. And when̛ þe bate was made, he gert a knyght of his gang into

was kyng of þe Bragmayns, of whilk lettre þis was þe tenour.

    ' Kyng of kynges and lorde of lordeȝ, Alexander þe son̛ of godd̛ Amon̛

When Dindimus hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, onane he wrate anoþer to kyng

When Alexander had̛ sent this lettre tiƚƚ Dyndimus he gart


      

rayse vp a pelare of Marble a wonder grete, & an heghe, and gart writt
þareapon this title wit lettres of grewe, of latyne, and of þe langage
of Inde. 'I Alexander, Philipp̛ son of Macedoyne, after þe discomfytour &

Fra þeine kyng Alexander & his Oste remowed̛ & come intiƚƚ a felde, þat
was called̛ Actea & þare þay luged̛. Abowte þat felde was a thikke wodd̛ of
treesse berand̛ fruyte; of þe whilke wilde men̛ þat duelt in þe Same wodd̛
vsede for tiƚƚ hafe þaire fude, whase bodyes ware grete as geaunteȝ, and
þaire clethynge ware made of skynnes of dyuerse besteȝ. And when̛ þay saw

And Alexander & his men̛ persued̛ þam̛ and slewe of þam̛ vic xxx iiij. And
þay slew of Alexander knyghtes xxvij. In þat felde Alexander & his oste
leuged̛ iij dayes and vetailed̛ þam of þat fruyte þat growed̛ in þe wodd̛.

Fra þeine pay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a grete ryuer, & luged̛ þam þare. And
as it ware abowte none, þare come apon̛ þam a wilde man̛, als mekiƚƚ als a

he was na thynge fered, ne fledd̛ noȝte, bot stodd̛ baldly bifore þam̛.
And when Alexander saw that, he comanded̛ þat þay sulde take a ȝonge

And Alexander wonderd̛ gretly of his figure. And þan̛ he

þan̛ þay herd̛ a voyce in þe ayer þat said̛ on þis wyse: 'What man̛ so

 Than þay remowed̛ fra þeine, And come tiƚƚ a Mountayne, þat was

And when̛ þay come to þe

Than Alexander demed̛ þat that dyuyson̛ betwix þase Mountaynes was made

þan̛ he gart a pavysse be made seuen̛ cubites of lenghte & foure on̛ brede;
and on̛ þe vtter syde þareoffe he gart sett a grete Mirroure, And a

Fra þeine þay went tiƚƚ þey come to þe ferreste of þat waye ; and

turned̛ agayne, and come to þe forsaide playne; and went by þat way þat
streched̛ towarde þe weste fyvftene .xv. days. And þan̛ þay lefte þat
way, And turnede on̛ þe lefte hande. And so þay went foure score iiij  days, and at þe
laste þay come tiƚƚ a Mountayne of adamande; and at þe fute þareoffe
þare hange chynes of golde. Þis Mountayne hadd̛ made of saphyres
twa thowsande greeȝ & a halfe, by þe whilke men̛ ascendid̛ to þe summit of
þe Mountayne. And þare Alexander & his Oste luged þam̛.

And on þe morne Alexander Offerd̛ sacrafice tiƚƚ his goddes, And þan̛ he
tuk with hym xij twelue prynceȝ of þe wyrchipfulleste þat he hade, and
went vp bi þe forsaid̛ greeȝ till he come aboun̛ on̛ þe Mountayne. And þare
he fande a palace wonder faire and curiously wroghte; and it hade twelve
ȝates and thre score & ten̛ wyndows. And þe lyntaƚƚs bathe of þe durs and
of þe wyndows ware of fyn̛ golde, wele burnescht, and þat Palace was
called̛ þe howse of þe son̛. Þare was also


      

a temple aƚƚ of golde & of precious stanes, And bifore þe dores þareoffe þare was a vyne of golde, berande grapes of charbuncles, of Rubyes,
Dyamandeȝ, and many oþer maneres of precyous stanes. Þan̛ kyng Alexander
& his princeȝ went into þe palace; and fande þare a man̛ liggand̛ in a
bedd̛ of golde, and couerd̛ wit a riche clathe of golde. And he was riȝte
a mekiƚƚ man̛ and a faire, And his berde & his heued̛ ware als whitt als
any woƚƚe; and hym semed̛ lyke a Bischoppe. Als son̛ als Alexander & his
prynceȝ saw þis alde man̛ þay knelid̛ dounne on þaire kneesse and saluste

þou saƚƚ see, þat neuer flescly man̛ bifore this tyme sawe; And þou saƚƚ
here þat neuer erthly man̛ herde are.' And Alexander ansuerd̛ & sayd̛:
Maste blyssed̛ alde man̛,' quoth he, 'how hase þou knawyng of me ?' 'For
sothe,' quoth he, 'bifore Noy flode couerde aƚƚ þe erthe, knewe I bathe

sothe,' quoþ Alexander, 'þer es nathynge þat I desyre mare, þan̛ for to

be clene of flescly dede wit women̛, þan̛ es it leefuƚƚ to ȝow to see þam̛
and to entir into þat haly place þat es a sette of godd̛. And if ȝe be
noȝte clene, it es noȝte leefuƚƚ to ȝow.' 'Ȝis, sir, sothely,' quoþ
Alexander, 'we ere clene.' Þan̛ raise þe alde man̛ vp of þe bedd̛ þat he
lay in, and said̛ vnto þam̛: 'Putteȝ offe ȝour ryngeȝ,' quoþ he, 'and
ȝoure clathes, & ȝour schone, and folowes me.' And þay dyd̛ so. And þan̛
Alexander tuk wit hym tholomeus and Antiochus, & folowed̛ þe alde man̛,
and went thurgℏ þe wodd̛ þat was aboun̛ on̛ þe Mountayne closed̛ with mannes
handeȝ. Þe treesse of þat wodd̛ ware an hundreth .c. fote
lange & hye, and þay ware lyke lorers or Olyue treesse; And out of þam̛
þare ran̛ rykyles & fynne bawme. And as þay went thurgℏ þat wodd̛ þay saw
a tree wondere hye, in þe whilke þare satt a mekiƚƚ fewle. Þat tree hadd̛
noþer þareon̛ lefes ne fruyte. Þe fewle þat satt þareon̛ hadd̛ on̛ his
hedd a creste lyk tiƚƚ a pacokke, & his beeke also crested̛. Abowte his
nekke, he hadd̛ fethirs lyke golde. Þe hynder of hym was lyk purpure;


      

and þe tayle was ownnded̛ ouerthwert, wit a colour reede as rose & wit
blewe. And his fethers ware riȝte faire schynand̛. When̛ Alexander saw þis
fewle he was gretely meruailled̛ of þe faired̛ of hym; þan̛ saide þe Alde
man̛: 'Alexander,' quoþ he, 'þis ilke fewle þat þou here seese es a
fenix.' And þan̛ þay went forþer thurgℏ þe forsaid̛ wodd̛, And come to
thiese haly treeȝ of þe son̛ & þe mone þat growed̛ in myddeȝ of þe wodde.
And þan̛ þe alde man̛ saide tiƚƚ Alexander: 'Luke vp,' quoþ he, 'to ȝone
haly treeȝ, and thynke in thi hert what preuatee so þe liste, and þou
saƚƚ hafe a trewe ansuere. Bot luke þat þou speke na worde in opyn̛. And
þareby saƚƚ þou witt þat it es a gude spiritt, þat knawes thi thoghte.'
Thir twa treeȝ were wonder hye. And þe tree of þe Son̛ had̛ leues lyk fyne
golde, reed & faire schynande. And þe tree of þe mone had lefes whitt
als syluer & faire schynande. And þan̛ walde Alexander hafe Offrede
Sacrafyce to þir treeȝ. Bot þe alde man̛ walde noȝte suffre hym̛, bot
said̛: 'It es noȝte leuefuƚƚ,' quoþ he, 'in þis haly place, nowþer to
offre encense, ne to slaa na besteȝ, Bot to knele doun̛ to þe boles of
þir treeȝ & kysse þam̛ & pray þe son̛ & þe mone to giffe trew ansuers.'
And þan Alexander spirred̛ þe alde man̛, in what langage þe treeȝ sulde
giffe þaire answers. And þe alde man̛ ansuerd̛ & said̛: 'The tree of þe
Son,' quoþ he, 'answers owþer aƚƚ in þe langage of Inde or eƚƚs of
grewe. And þe tree of þe Mone begynneȝ wit þe langage of grewe & endeȝ
wit þe langage of Inde.'

And as þay stode þus spekande, Sudaynly þare come a bryghte beme fra þe
weste þat schane ouer aƚƚ þe wodde. And þan̛ Alexander kneled̛ doun̛, and
kyssede þe treeȝ an thoght þus in his hert: 'Saƚƚ I conquere aƚƚ þe
werlde, and efterwardeȝ wit þe victorye wende hame to Macedoyne tiƚƚ my
moder Olympias, and my sisters? And þan̛ þe tree of þe son̛
ansuerd̛ softly in þe langage of Inde, And said þir verseȝ: 'Tu
dominatorum orbis dominus simul et pater extas,Set patrum rignum per
tempora nulla videbis;'þat es at say, 'þou ert bathe lorde & fader of

and whate dedd̛ he sulde dye. And þe tree of þe Mone ansuerd̛ by þir twa
verseȝ: 'Anno completo viues & mensibus octo,De quo confidis tibi mortis
pocula dabit.' Þat es at saye, 'A twluemonthe & aughte monethes saƚƚ þou

Þan̛ bigan̛ Alexander to thynke in his hert on̛ þis wyse,

    'Tell me now, haly tree,Wha he es þat sall slaa mee.'

And þan̛ þe tree of þe son̛ ansuerd̛ by þir twa verseȝ: 'Si tibi pandatur
vir qui tua facta resoluet,Illum confrynges & sic mea carmina fallent.'
Þat es at say: 'And I schew the þe manes name, þat saƚƚ vndo thi dedis,
þou wiƚƚ slaa hym̛, and so saƚƚ my prophycye fayle.' And þan̛ þe forsaide
ald man̛ sayd̛ tiƚƚ Alexander: 'Disese na mare þir trees,' quoþ he, 'wit
thyne askynges. Bot tourne we agayne, as we come hedir.' And þan̛
Alexander & his twa prynceȝ wit hym tourned̛ agayne wit þe alde man̛. And
ay as he went, he weped̛ bitterly, bicause of his schorte tyme; and his
prynceȝ also weped riȝte sare. Bot he commanded̛ þam̛ þat þay schulde
noȝte teƚƚe to na man̛ of his Oste þat that þay hadd̛ herde & sene. And
when̛ þay ware comen̛ to þe forsaide Palace þe alde  said̛ vntiƚƚ
Alexander: ' Torne bakke agayne,' quoth he, 'for it es noȝte leefuƚƚ to

noȝte traueƚƚe fuƚƚ lange are þou come to þe place, whare þe liste to

and Alexander and his twa prynceȝ went doun̛ by þe forsaide greeȝ & come
to þe Oste.

Apon þe morne Alexander & his Oste remowed̛ þeine & went agayneward̛
fyftene days, And come agayne to þe forsaid̛ playne & þare þay luged þam̛.
And þare at þe entree of þa twa forsaid̛ ways, Alexander gart rayse vp
twa pelers of Marble, and bytwixe þam̛ he haude a table of golde, on þe
whilke was wretyn in þe langage of grewe, hebrew, of latyne, and of
Inde, one this wyse: 'I, Alexander, Phillipp̛ son̛ of Macedoyne,


      

sett thir pelers here, after þe dedd̛ of Darius kyng of Perse and of

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ thurgℏ þat playne and lefte þase strayte wayes,
takand̛ þe way westeward̛ þe gayneste towarde Macedoyne. And at þe laste
þay come tiƚƚ a cuntree þat highte Prasiac, And þare þay luged̛ þam̛. And
when̛ men̛ of þat cuntree herd̛ of þe commynge of Alexander, wit grete
wirchipe þay broghte hym grete presanteȝ of swilk thyngeȝ as þay hadd̛ in
þaire lande, þat es at say, skynnes of fischez lyke vnto þe skynnes of

Amangeȝ her embassatours þat scho sent tiƚƚ Alexander þare was a wonder
crafty & a suteƚƚ payntoure. And hym scho charged̛ þet he schulde besely

reuerently and sent hir noble gyftes agayne wit hir embassatours. And
when̛ þay come hame þe payntour tuke hir þe fegure of Alexander purtrayed̛
as I saide before. And when̛ þe quene saw it, Scho was riȝte gladde, for
scho desyred̛ gretly for to see his fygure.

After þis ane of þe quene sonnes þat hight Candeolus went furthe of þe
Citee wit his wyfe and a fewe of his menȝee for to take þe sporte. And
onane þe kyng of þe Bebrikes, knawyng þe fairehed̛ of Candeolus wyfe,

And when̛ Candace herd teƚƚ þat hir son̛ Candeolus and his wyfe ware

Apon̛ þe morne quene Candace tuk Alexander by þe right hande & ledd̛ hym

Neuerþelesse my wyfe constreyneȝ me for to do Antyochus to dede bicause of þe dede of hir Fadir Porus, whilke Alexander slewe, So þat

Alexander on syde & sayd̛ vntiƚƚ hym in preuatee: 'Wele ware me,' quoþ
scho, 'myghte I ilke day hafe þe present before myn̛ eghne as I hafe myn̛

 gaffe Alexander a coroun̛ of golde sett fuƚƚ of precyous

sternes wofen þarein̛, and sett fuƚƚ of precyouse stanes. And þan̛ scho
kyssed̛ hym & oþer preuee thyngeȝ didd̛ tiƚƚ hym, And badde hym goo in hir
blyssynge.

Than kyng Alexander and Candeolus went furthe aƚƚ that daye, And come
tiƚƚ a grete spelunc, and þare þay herberde þam̛. And Candeolus saidetiƚƚ
Alexander: 'In this spelunc,' quoþ hee, 'þat you here seeȝ aƚƚ goddeȝ
ere wount for to ete and halde þaire consaiƚƚ.' And þan̛ onane Alexander
made sacrafyceȝ tiƚƚ his goddeȝ and enterde into þe caue by hym ane.
And þare he sawe a myrke clowde, & in þat myrknesse, he sawe as it ware
bryghte sternes, and amangeȝ þase sternes he saw a grete godd̛ sitt, And
his eghne lyke twa lanternes. And when̛ Alexander saw hym̛ he was so fered̛
þat he was as it hadd̛ bene


      

in a transynge. And þan̛ þe godd̛ said vnto hym̛: 'Haile, Alexander,' quoþ
he. And Alexander ansuerde & said̛: 'Lorde,' quoþ he, 'what art þou ?' 'I
am,' quoþ he, 'Senson̛chosis þat gouerneȝ þe kyngdom̛ of þe werlde and þat
hase made men̛ sugettes vnto the. And þou hase bigged̛ þiselfe many

And Alexander ansuerd̛ & said̛: 'Lorde,' quoþ he, '& þou wiƚƚ graunt me

ansuerd̛ agayne & saide: 'For sothe,' quoþ hee, 'Macedoyne saƚƚ þou neuer

a godd̛ sitt in a trone lyke a kynge, and Alexander said vntiƚƚ hym:
'Lorde,' quoþ he, 'what art þou ?' 'I am,' quoþ he, 'þe begynnynge of
aƚƚ goddeȝ and Serapis es my name. I sawe the in þe lande of liby & nowe

hase bygged a glorious citee agaynes þe whilke many emperours saƚƚ

And þan̛ Alexander come oute of þe caue, and tuke his leue at Candeolus
and went tiƚƚ his Oste.

One þe morne he remowed̛ his Oste And come tiƚƚ a valay þat was fuƚƚ of
grete serpentes þe whilk hade in þaire heuedis Grete smaragdeȝ. Thir
serpenteȝ lyffede aƚƚ wit gyngere and pepir þat growede in þe
valaye. And ilke a ȝere þay feghte togedir and many of þam̛ slaeȝ oþer.
Off þe forsaid Smaragdes tuk Alexander sum̛ wit hym of þe gretteste þat
he couthe gett.

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ & come intiƚƚ a place in þe whilke þare ware
besteȝ þat hade one ilke a fote twa clees as swyne hase, and þase clees
ware three fote brade wit þe whilke þay smate Alexander knyghtes. Þay
had also heuedes lyke swyne & tayles lyke lyouns. Þare ware also amangeȝ
þam̛ grypes þe


      

whilke smate kynghtes in þe vesageȝ reghte felly. Þay ware so
strange þat ane of þam̛ wolde bere away an armed̛ knyghte & his horse

comforthed̛ þam̛ and badd̛ þam̛ feghte manly agaynes þam̛ wit speres and wit
arowes. And so þay did̛. Bot þare was slayne of Alexander knyghtes ccviii.

And fra þeine þay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a grete ryuer þe whilke was
twenty furlange on brede fra þe ta banke to þe toþer. And on þase bankes
þare growed̛ redis wonder grete and hye. Of þase redes garte Alexander
mak bates & anoynte þam̛ wit terre & talgℏ of besteȝ, And badd̛ his
knyghtis row ouer þe water in þase bates. And þay did̛ soo. And when̛ þe
 of þe cunntree herde teƚƚ of þe commynge of Alexander & his
Oste, þay sent hym gyftes of swylk thyngeȝ als was in þaire cuntree, þat
es at say Grete spoungeȝ bathe whitte & purpure & schelles of þe see so
grete þat an of þam̛ walde halde twa pekkes or three. Þay sent hym also
wormes þat þay drew owte of þat ryuer grettere þan̛ a manes thee, and þay
ware swetter of taste þan̛ any fysche. Þay gaffe hym Cukstoles aƚƚ rede
þat ware of a wonderfuƚƚ gretnesse. In þat ryuer ware womans þat ware
wonder faire & þay hade on̛ þam̛ mekiƚƚ here þat rechedd̛ doun̛ to thaire
fete. Þir women̛, when þay saw any straunge men̛ swymme in þat riuer,
owþer þay drownned̛ þam̛ in þe water, or eƚƚs þay walde lede þam̛ to þe
redeȝ þat growed̛ on̛ þe water bankes and garre þam̛ lye by þam̛ ay tiƚƚ any

þam̛ tiƚƚ Alexander, and þay ware als white as any snawe,
and þay ware ten fote lange and þaire teethe ware lyke dogge teethe.

Efter this Alexander went and closed̛ in a maner of folkee þat are called̛
Gog & Magog, within þe hilleȝ of Caspy. Þis folkeȝ were of þe ten
kyndeȝ of Israel, and þay ware leedd̛ owte of þaire awenn̛ land̛ bi a kyng
of Perse because of þaire synneȝ and halden in thralledom̛. And þay
asched̛ Alexander leue for to wende furtℏ of þat cuntree. And Alexander
gert spirre þe cause of þaire thraldom̛, and he was encensed̛ þat because þay


      

hadd̛ forsaken̛ þaire goddeȝ lawe, þat es at say, godd̛ of Isrƚ, and
wirchiped̛ Calues & oþer Mawmettes, þarefore þay ware ledd̛ oute of þaire
awenn̛ lande & halden̛ in thralldom̛, and þat prophetes had prophiced̛ before þat þay sulde neuer come oute of thraldom̛ bifore agayne þe day of

seurely. And þan̛ he garte close aƚƚ þe entreeȝ wit stane & lyme & sand̛,
Bot aƚƚ þat he garte make on þe day was fordone on̛ þe nyghte. And when̛
Alexander saw þat mannes laboure myghte noȝte stande in stede, he bisoghte godd̛ of Isrƚ þat if it ware his liste þat þay habade þare, þat he
walde close þam̛ in. And þe nexte nyghte aftir ilk a cragge feƚƚe tiƚƚ
oþer, and so þare may nathynge passe in nor owte. And þareby it semeȝ
þat it es noȝte goddeȝ wiƚƚ þat þay come oute. Neuerþelesse abowte þe
Ende of þe werlde þay saƚƚ breke oute and do mekiƚƚ schathe & slaa many men̛.

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ & come to þe grete See Occeane. In þat See þay
sawe ane Ile a littiƚƚ fra þe lande. And in þat Ile þay herde men̛ speke
grewe. And þan̛ Alexander commanded̛ þat sum̛ of his knyghts sulde do off
þaire clathes and swyme ouer to þe ile. And þay did̛ soo. And als sone
als þay come in þe See þare come gret crabbes vp oute of þe water &
pullede þam̛ downne to þe grounde & drownned̛ þam̛.

Thanne remowed̛ þay fra thethyn̛ and went ay endlande þe See syde towarde
þe solstice of wynter trauellande xƚ days; and at þe laste þay come to a
reede See, and þare þay lugede þam̛. Þare was faste by a Mountayne wonder

þareoffe, hym thoghte þat he was nerre þe Firmament þan þe erthe; þan̛
he ymagned̛ in his hert swilk a gynn̛ how he myghte make grippes
bere hym vp into þe ayere. And onane he come doune of þe Mountayne and
garte come bifore hym̛ his Maistre wrightes and comandid̛ þam̛ þat þay
sulde make hym a chayer and trelesse it wit barreȝ of Iren̛ one ilk a

gripes and tye þam̛ faste wit Iren̛ cheynes vnto þe chayere, and in þe
ouermare party of þe chayere he gart putt


      

mete for þe grippes. And pan̛ he wente and sett hym̛ in þe chayere. And
onane þe grippes bare hym vp in þe ayer so hye þat Alexander thoghte aƚƚ
þe erthe na mare þan̛ a flure þare men̛ thresscheȝ corne, and þe See lyke

vmbilapped þe grippes þat gart þam̛ discende douue to þe erthe in a
felde: ten .x. day iournee fra þe Oste, and he hadd̛ na hurt ne na
schathe in þe chayere. Bot wit grete disesse at þe laste he come tiƚƚ
his Oste.

After þis Alexander ymagened in his hert þat he walde knaw þe preuates
þat are in þe see. And onane he gart come bifore hym̛ aƚƚ þe Maister
glasyers þat ware in þe Oste, And comandede þam̛ to make hym a grete
tounne of passandly clere glasse þat he myghte thurgℏ it clerely see aƚƚ

trelesse it al abowte witowtten̛ wit barres of yren̛ and feste þareto
lang cheynes of yren̛, and gart a certane of þe strangeste & maste tristy
knyghtes þat langed̛ vntiƚƚ hym halde þir cheynes. And þan̛ he went into
þe tounne & gart pykke wele þe entree whare he went in, and þan̛ late it
doun̛ into þe See. And þare he sawe dyuerse schappes of fisches of
dyuerse colours; and sum̛ he sawe hafe þe schappe of dyuerse besteȝ here
one þe lande, gangande on fete as besteȝ dose here & etande fruyte of
treesse þat groweȝ on þe See grunde. Þir besteȝ come tiƚƚ hym. Bot onane
as þay saw hym thorow þe glasse þay fledde fra hym. He sawe þare also
many oþer meruaylous thyngeȝ, þe whilke he walde teƚƚ na man̛ bicause
men̛ walde noghte hafe trowed̛ þam̛ if he had talde þam̛, and at a certayne
houre þase þat he hadd̛ assyngned before, his knyghtes drewe hym vp oute
of þe See.

Fra þeine þay Remowed̛ Folowande þe bankes of þe Rede See, and luged þam̛
in a place, whare þare ware wylde Besteȝ that hade on̛ þaire heuedis
hornes lyke vnto sawes, and þay ware als scharpe als
swerdeȝ. And with thire hornes þay slewe & hurte many knyghtis of
Alexanders & cloue þaire cheldes in sonder. Neuerþelesse Alexander
knyghtis slew of þam̛ ccccli.

And fra beine þay remowed̛ and come intiƚƚ wilderness


      

bitwex þe reed̛ See and Araby, whare grete multitude of Pepir growed̛; And
þare ware many grete nedders wit hornnes on þaire hedes lyke tuppe
hornes, wit þe whilke þay smate Alexander knyghtis riȝt felly. Off þase
nedderes slew þe Macedoynes a grete party.

Þeine þay remowed̛ and luged̛ in a place whare many Rynosephales ware, þe
whilke hade heuedes & manes lyke horseȝ. And þay hade grete bodys, and
wonder grete teethe and lange, and oute of þaire mouthes þay schotte
flawmeȝ of fyre. And when̛ þay saw þe Oste luge þare þay come & assaylled̛
þam̛. And Alexander ran̛ hyder and thedir amangeȝ þe oste and comforthed̛
his knyghtes and bad þam̛ feghte manly wit þase monstres. And so þay
didd̛. Neuerþelesse þare ware a grete multitude of his knyghtis slayne
of þase besteȝ. Bot of þe Rynocephales þare was slayne an hugge multitude.

Þan̛ þay remowed̛ fra þeine and come intiƚƚ a champayne cuntree and luged̛
þam̛ þare, And lay þare a certane days, Bicause of his horse Buktyphalas
þat feƚƚ seke þare; of þe whilke sekenesse he dyed̛. And when̛ Alexander
saw hym dedd̛ he made grete dole for hym and weped̛ for hym riȝt sare. For
he hadd̛ borne hym in many a Bateƚƚe, and broghte  oute of many
pereƚƚs. And þarefore when̛ he was dede Alexander gart doo aboute hym
grete exequyes and gart make hym a fuƚƚ riche toumbe & a hye and did̛ hym
þarein and made a grete citee þare, þe whilke in mynde of his horse he
gart caƚƚ Buktyphalas.

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a ryuere þat was called̛ Cytan or
Deciracy whare men̛ of þe cuntree broghte hym̛ ṽ Olyphantes and ṽ cartes
of werre. And fra þeine þay remowed̛ & come tiƚƚ kynge ȝerses palace. And
in þat Palace þay fande beddeȝ of clene golde many a thowsande. Þare
ware also grete fewles white als doufes, þe whilke had knawyng before
of a seke man̛ wheder he schulde lyffe or dye. For if þay byhelde þe
seke man̛ in þe vesage, he schulde mende & fare wele. And if þay tourned̛
þam awaywarde witowtten̛


      

doute he schulde dye, and if þay tourned hym þe bakke wit
owtten̛ dowte he sulde dye.

FRa þeine þay remowed̛ and come to þe grete Citee of Babiloyne and wanne
it oo werre and slew þe kynge þareoffe & þe Captayne also. And pare he
duelled̛ vntiƚƚ his lyffes end̛, and pat was Bot vij seuen̛ Monethes. In
þat mene tyme Alexander sent a lettre tiƚƚ Olympias his Moder and tiƚƚ
his Mayster Arestotle, latand̛ þam̛ witte of þe Bateƚƚs and þe dyssese þat
þay suffred̛ bathe wynters and Somers in Inde and oþer cuntreeȝ, and also
of þe Bateƚƚs þat þay had̛ hadd̛ wit dyuerse Monstres. And þan̛ Arestotle
wrate anoþer lettre tiƚƚ Alexander agayne þe whilke was of this tenour:

    'Untiƚƚ Alexandere þe grete kynge of kyngeȝ Arestotle sendeȝ ioy
    and seruyce. When̛ I hade redde ȝour wyrchipfuƚƚ lettres I was gretly
    astonayd̛. For whilke cause I desyre with aƚƚ myn̛ hert for to fynde
    lonynge þat I myghte ȝelde vnto þe. I take witnesse at oure goddeȝ
    þat for þe passande hardenesse of þi ℏert & þe grete auentours þat

    For þou hase sene & assayed̛ thyngeȝ þat neuer man̛ or þis durste

    thy prynceȝ þat hase bene obeyande vnto þe, and helped̛ þe in aƚƚ thi

Afftir þis Alexander gart make in Babyloyne a wonder curious trone of
golde, þare was noȝte swilke anoþer in þe werlde. For þe grekeȝ broghte
so mekiƚƚ golde oute of perse & oute of Inde, þat it ware wonder for to
telle. Þis ilke toure was twlue cubyteȝ hye and by twelue greceȝ men̛
ascended̛ þaretoo, and þase greeȝ ware aƚƚ of golde. Þis trone was
wonderfully wroghte and sett apon̛ twelue ymageȝ of golde, þe whilke
trone þe forsaid̛ ymageȝ helde vp wit þaire hende. And on þase twelue
ymageȝ ware wretyn̛ þe names of þe twelue prynceȝ of Macedoyne. Þe seet
of þe trone was of a Smaragde,


      

& þe sydeȝ þare off ware of Topaȝes & in ilkan̛ of þe greeȝ ware sett
dyuerse maneres of precyouse stanes. In þe summyt of þis trone þare
wassett a ruby þat schane on þe nyghte as it hade bene þe Mone. In þis
trone also was þare sett on̛ ilke a syde dyuerse ymageȝ on þe whilke ware
wretyn̛ bathe in latyne & in grew verseȝ þat contened̛ aƚƚ þe
nammes of þe rewmes & cuntreeȝ þat Alexandere had conquered̛ and ware
sugetes vntiƚƚ hym.

After þis Alexander gert make a coron̛ of golde sett fuƚƚ of aƚƚ maner of
precyouse stanes, and gert wryte apon̛ it a tytle in grew & in latyn̛:
'Ortus & occasus, Aquilo michi seruit & Auster.' Þat es at saye: 'Est &
weste, Northe & southe dose seruyce vnto me.' In the mene tyme whils
Alexander was in babyloyne, a woman̛ was delyuer of a knaue childe þe
whilke fra þe heuede to þe nauyƚƚ hadd̛ schappe of man̛, & was borne dedd̛.
And fra þe nauyƚƚ downwardeȝ it had lyknesse of dyuerse besteȝ and was
qwykke. Þis Monstre was taken̛ & broghte tiƚƚ Alexander; and als son̛ als
he saw it he meruaylled̛ gretly þareoff, and gart come bifore hym̛ a
philosopher þat couthe of wichecrafte, & aschede hym what it sygnyfyed̛.
And when̛ þe philosopher saw it, he syghede, & saye wepand̛ sayde vnto
hym: 'Sothely wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,' quoþ he, 'þe tyme commeȝ nere that
þou saƚƚ passe oute of this werlde.' 'Telle me,' quoþ Alexander,
'whareby þou knawes þat.' And þe philosophre ansuerde & sayde: 'My
lorde,' quoþ he, 'þe halfe of þis Monstre þat hase þe schappe of man̛ &
es dedd̛, betakens þat þou saƚƚ passe out of þis werlde in haste. And þe
toþer party þat hase þe lyknes of dyuerse besteȝ & es on lyfe,
betakynges þe kynges þat saƚƚ come after þe. Bot þare saƚƚ nane of þam̛
be lyke vnto þe, na mare þan̛ a beste es lyke vntiƚƚ a man̛.' When̛
Alexander herde þis he was wonder heuy, and sare wepand̛ he sayde on þis
wyse: 'O Aƚƚmyghty Iubiter,' quoþ he, 'what meneȝ it þat my dayes saƚƚ
be so schortte ? Me thynke þat it had bene semely þat I had leffed̛

mekiƚƚ als it es noȝte plesande vnto þe, I beseke the þat þou resayffe

In this mene tyme þare was in Macedoyne a lorde þat highte


      

Antipater, þe whilke of langetyme before hadd̛ casten for þe dedde of
Alexander; And wit many oþer þat he hadd̛ confedred̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛ he
conspyred̛ for to brynge it tyƚƚ ende, bot he myghte neuer come aboute
þerwith. For Olympias, Alexander moder, wrate vntiƚƚ hym oftesythes
and warned̛ hym þat he scholde be warre wit Antipater & his childre, and
herefore was Antypater wonder sary. So apon̛ a tyme he vmbythoghte hym
þat he myghte neuer come aboute wit his purpose for to slaa Alexander,
bot if it ware thurgℏ enpuysonynge. And so apon̛ a daye he went
tiƚƚ a Soteƚƚ leche, and boghte of hym̛ a maner of drynke made of puyson̛
that was so feƚƚe & se ranke þat þare myghte no vesseƚƚe halde it Bot a

son̛ Cassandre, and bad̛ hym bere it tiƚƚ his broþer Iobas and byd̛ hym,
quoþ he, gyffe it to kyng Alexander in his drynke, when̛ he seeȝ his
tyme. This ilk Iobas was a faire ȝong man̛ & was duellyng with Alexander,
and gretly byluffede & cheriste of hym. Bot so it befeƚƚe apon̛ a tyme
þat Alexander smate Iobas on þe heued̛ wit a warderere for na trespasse.
Wharefore Iobas was gretly angred̛ and greued̛ at Alexander and consented̛
tiƚƚ his dede, and tuke þe puyson̛ of his broþer þat was ordeyned̛ for
Alexander dede þat luffed̛ hym̛ so mekiƚƚ.

And apon̛ a daye Alexander gart ordeyne a grete reueƚƚe in Babyloyne and
called̛ þare too aƚƚ his prynceȝ on̛ ilke a syde. And as he satt at þe
mete Imange his prynceȝ he was wonder mery & gladde & iocund̛, and
reheted̛ his lordeȝ & prayed̛ þam̛ þat þay schulde be mery. Þan̛ Iobas þat
serued̛ þe kyng of his coupe tuke of þe puyson̛ a porcyon̛, and putt it
vnder þe nayle of his thowme, and broghte þe coppe to þe kynge fuƚƚ of
wyne. And as he gaffe it to þe kynge, he lete þe puyson̛ faƚƚe in þe wyne
priualy. And als sone als þe kyng hadd̛ dronken̛ þe puyson̛, Sudaynly he
gaffe a grete scryke, and lened̛ hym downn̛ towarde þe riȝte syde. For hym
thoghte reghte als a man̛ hadd̛ smyten̛ hym into þe lyuere wit a suerde.
Neuerþelesse he feyned̛ & forbare a while & suffred̛ a grete penance,
and when̛ he myȝte na langere habyde, he rase vp fra þe burde and saide
tiƚƚ his lordeȝ & his knyghtes: 'Lordyngis,' quoþ he,


      

'I pray ȝow sitt ȝe stiƚƚ & eteȝ & drynkeȝ & beeȝ mery.' Bot þay ware
gretly troubbled̛ and rase vp fra þe burdeȝ and stode witowtten̛ for to

and soghte a fethir for to putt in his throtte for to garre hym hafe a

broghte it tiƚƚ Alexander; and he tuk it & putt it in his throtte, and
belyfe þe puyson̛ vexed̛ hym ay mare & mare. And þan̛
Alexander bade ane gange & open̛ þe palace ȝates þat ware on Eufrates

mydnyȝthte he rase oute of þe bedde þat he lay in and putt oute þe

And Rosan̛ his wyfe folowed̛ as faste as scho myghte. And when̛ scho come

armed̛ to þe Palace, and cryed̛ on þe prynceȝ & said̛ vnto þam̛ :
'Sothely,' quoþ þay, 'but if ȝe onane schewe vs oure Emperour we saƚƚ
slaa ȝow ilk ane.' And when̛ kyng Alexander herde swilke noyse he askede
whate it ment, and þe prynceȝ ansuerde & sayde: 'Þe Macedoynes,' quoþ
þay, 'are comen̛ armede hedir before þe ȝates, & says sekerly bot if þay
see ȝow þay saƚƚ slaa vs aƚƚe are þay passe heþine.' And when̛ Alexander
herde þis, he badd̛ his knyghtis þat þay scholde take hym vp, and bere
hym into þe consistorye. And þay did soo. And þan̛ he garte open̛ þe
Palace ȝates þat þe Macedoynes myȝte come byfore hym. And þan̛ kyng
Alexander began̛ to comend̛ þam̛ of þaire strenth & þaire grete doghtynes,
and charged þam̛ þat þay scholde be in pesse & reste ilkane wit oþer. Þan̛
þe Macedoynes, sare wepande, sayde vntiƚƚ Alexander: 'A, A,
wirchipfuƚƚ,' quoþ þay, 'ordayne & teƚƚe vs are ȝe passe


      

heyne wham̛ ȝe wiƚƚ þat be oure emperour efter ȝow.' And Alexander
ansuerd̛ & sayde, ' A, A, my dere knyghtis,' quoþ he, ' when̛ I am dede
whaym̛ so ȝe wiƚƚ chese, be ȝour emperour efter mee.' And þay ansuerde, '
Lord,' quoþ þay, ' we beseke ȝowe þat ȝe wiƚƚ graunt vs Perdic to be
oure Emperour.' 'I vouche wele saffe,' quoþ Alexander, 'þat Perdic be
ȝour Emperour. Gers hym come before mee.' And when̛ he was comen̛ byfore
hym he gaffe hym þe kyngdome of Macedoyne wit þe
Emperourchipe. And he gaffe hym also Rosan̛ for to be his wyffe, and
prayed̛ hym þat he walde be gude & gentiƚƚ tiƚƚ hir. And þan he kyssede
aƚƚ þe lordeȝ & þe knyghtis of Macedoyne ilkane after oþer, and sighed
and weped̛ wonder sare. Þare was þan̛ so grete dole & wepynge, þat it was
lyke a thonere. For men̛ Supposeȝ þat noȝte allanly men̛ made Sorow for þe
dede of so worthy ane Emperour, Bot also þe son̛ and aƚƚ þe oþer planetis
and elementes ware troubled.

A prynce of Macedoyne stode nere Alexander bedd̛ þat highte Seleucus, &
wit grete dole & wepynge he sayd̛: 'A, A, þou wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,' quoþ
he, 'what saƚƚ we do when̛ þou ert dede. Philippe þi fader gouerned̛ vs
wele & aƚƚe oure rewme, Bot þe gentilnes & þe largesse of the na tunge
may teƚƚ.' And þan̛ Alexander sett hym vp in his bedd̛ and gaffe hym̛ selfe
a grete flappe on þe cheke and bygan̛ for to wepe riȝte bitterly, and in
þe langage of Macedoyne, he sayde on þis wyse:

'Fuƚƚ waa es me vnhappy wreche,' quoþ he, 'þat euer I was borne to man̛.
For now Alexander dyes and Macedoyne saƚƚ waxe ay lesse & lesse and
emenische day bi day.' Than̛ aƚƚ þe Macedoynes wit an hye voyce and
bitter wepynge sayd vntiƚƚ hym: 'Better it ware tiƚƚ vs,' quoþ þay, '
for to dy wit þe þan̛ for to se þe dy in oure presence. For wele we wate
þat, efter þe dede of the, þe kyngdom̛ of Macedoyne es vndone for euere.
Allas oure wirchipfuƚƚ Alexander, why lefes þou vs here and wendeȝ away
be thyn̛ ane, withowten̛ thi Macedoynes ?' Than̛ kyng Alexander alway
sighand̛ & wepand̛ said vnto þam: 'A, A, my dere Macedoynes,' quoþ he,
'fra this tym̛ forwarde saƚƚ neuer ȝour name hafe lordchipe ouer þe
Barbarenes.' And ban̛ þe Macedoynes cryed̛ and sayde: 'O wirchipfuƚƚ
lorde,' quoþ


      

þay, 'þou ledd̛ vs into Perse, Arraby, and Inde, and vnto the werldeȝ
ende, and into what cuntree þat þe liste wende; why, lorde, fleeȝ þou
now fra vs ? Lede vs wit the whedir so þou gase.' Þan̛ kyng Alexander
sent to þe templee of Appollo in̛ Athenes many riche iowels, and on þe
same wyse tiƚƚ aƚƚ oþer temples. And þan̛ he commanded̛ þat when̛ he ware
dede, þay schulde enoynte his body and embawme it wit riche oynementes,
þe whilke kepis menes bodys in graues witowtten̛ corupcioun̛. Þan̛ he
badde Tholomeus þat he scholde  a c̃ besantes of golde, & þareoff
gere make hym a tombe in Alexander. And onane as he had̛
commanded̛ hym þus, oneseeand̛ þam̛ aƚƚ, he swelt. And þan̛ his prynceȝ
lifte vp his body, and did̛ apon̛ his clethyng of astate and putt a riche
coron̛ on̛ his heued, and sett hym in þe emperours chayer, þe whilke
twelue prynceȝ drewe wit þaire bresteȝ fra Babiloyne tiƚƚ Alexander.
Tholomeus went alway bifore þe chayere wepande & sayande one þis wyse:
'Fuƚƚ waa es me, My lord̛ Alexander, waa es me. For in aƚƚ thi lyfe slew
þou neuer so many men̛ as þou dose nowe after þi dede.' Aƚƚ Alexanders
knyghtis also weped̛ & made grete dole & sayde on̛ þis wyse: 'Waa es vs
weches ! whatt schaƚƚ wee now do after þe dede of oure lorde Alexander ?
Whedir saƚƚ we now gaa or whate partye may we now chese? Whare schaƚƚ we
now get any helpe tiƚƚ oure lyfelade?' One þis wyse þay went wepand̛
after Alexander, tiƚƚ þay come tiƚƚ þe citee of Alexander. And þare þay
beryed̛ hym in a toumbe þat was riȝte hye and wonder curyouslye wroghte.
Þis tombe was aƚƚ of fyne golde sett fuƚƚ of precyous stanes, and on̛ þat
toumbe þer was sett xxx ymages of golde wonder craftily made.

Alexander was a man̛ bot of a comon̛ stature, wit a lange nekke, Faire
eghne & glad̛, his chekes ruddy, and aƚƚ þe remenant of his lymmes ware
faire & semely & lyke vntiƚƚ a lorde. He ouercome aƚƚ men̛ & neuer was
ouercomen̛. The lenthe of his lyffe was xxxij ȝere, twa & thritty ȝere &
seuen̛ monethes. Fra þe twentyd̛ ȝere of his birthe he gaffe hym to werre,
and in twelue ȝere he conquered̛ aƚƚ þe werlde, and made subiect untiƚƚ

        PROLOGUE.

As I on hilly halkes logged me late, Beside ny of a ladi sone was I war;
La bele me desired in englysh to translate


      

The latyn of that lady, Asneth putifar. And I answered, "ma bele,
langage I lakke,  To parfourme youre plesir, for yt ys ful straunge
That broken tuskes shold wel harde nuttis crakke, And kerue out the
kernelis, to glade with yowre graunge; For lame and vnlusty, now age
hath me left, Mi spiritis are spended, I lakke sapience, 
Dulled I am with dotage, my reson ys me reft, Prived and departed from
al eloquence, So my seson ys passed with language to iape. Hit ys not
fetis for to see a cowe in a cage Ye  desire to make a fool of
my lordis ape. 
He plesed neuer lady wel þat lakked corage, For as þe oule ys vn able to
blase þe sunne bemys, So ys þe moselyng molle to iaile þe rede rose, And
as able ys þe asse to danielis dremys,
As þe cukkou with crochetis ony countour to close."  And when
daunger deynusly here desire refused, Labele ful benignely sayde to me
þan, "That seruant ys not to blame, but fully excused, That meketh hym
to his maystresse, & doth as he can." Concluded þus with gentilnesse, I
toke on me þe cure, 
Asneth storie to translate after my cunyng, Fro latyn into englysh as
god me sendeth oeure. Gyde þis werke, gracious lord, and graunte it good
endyng, Utterali the latyn in englysh to transpose, Hit is nuyus, but þe
sentence I schal sue in trace, 
And yf ye fynde fautes, grave hem with yowr glose, I pray ȝow thus, my
maystresse, of yowre good grace.


        THE STORY.

Pharao the famus kyng of egipt land aboute, The firste yeer of seven
yeeris of plentevus abundance, The fifthe day, in þe secunde monthe, he
sende Ioseph oute 


      

To purveie wete for þe peple of his obeisance; And in the ferthe monthe,
þe eyhtethe day, to make pur∣veance Ioseph cam into þe cuntre of
helinpoleos, And gadered whete of that region, nobeli sprang his loos.
And in þat cite þere was a prince of Pharao the kynges,  That was
wondir noble and riche, and of gret prudence, Sad of conseyl, meke, and
wise, in alle maner thyngys; Chief cunseilour to Pharao for his
intelligence. Above alle princes he was preferred for his excellence; Of
Helinpoleos preest, Putifar, so men did hym calle,  Honoured in
alle egipt of gret and of smalle.
This prince hadde a dowter dere, Asneth was her name, A virgine ful
specious and semely of stature, Of eyhtene yeer age sche was, withoute
ony blame, Florishyng in here beaute, the most comely creature  Of
egipt, and alle virgines sche passed in feture. Not lyke the dowhtres of
egipt in here resemblance, But assemblyng the hebrees in colour and
countenance.


      

Of stature semeli as sair, specious as rebekke, Fair formed of feturis,
assemblyng to rachel.  Her cors was ful comely of hue, hed & nekke.
Cumfortable, of cuntenance, hit becam here wel; Of here souerain beaute
al egipt gan tel, And praysed here in alle þat lande, so noble was here
fame, That bataile among princes children was ioyned for þat  dame.
But when þat pharaois eldist child, his sone & his heir, Herde telle of
this ladi, to his fadir he wente right, And said, "graunte me to my wyf
asneth the feyr." But pharao denyed hym, and answered to the knyght,
"Thu schalt haue to þin astate a ladi of more myght,  The kyngis
dowter of moab, of noble alliance, A comeli quene, fair and free, evene
to þi plesance."
But asneth, þat was so feir, soleyn she was with al, Dispisyng eche man
deynusly, and prowd of here corage. A ful high tour was bild for here,
of werk þat was rial,  Ioynyng to hire fadir hous, and aboue it
vpon stage Ten chambres for here wer bild, of precious parage. The
firste was fair and large, with porfereit stonis walled, Poudred with
precious polimites, of diuerse colours called.
With carpettis of cloth of gold hit was laid abowte,  And in the
wallis here egipt godis sette in sundry wyse, Wrouht of goold & siluer
wel, of hem sche had gret doute, For eueri day to the same sche dide
sacrifice.


      

In the secunde chamber was here atire, of ful riche assise, Goold,
siluer, precious stonis, and garnementis gaye,  Schetis of silk,
and robis fyne, of ful riche araye.
The thridde chamber was for stoor stuffed as ye shul here Of alle goodis
þat growe on erthe, to mannys sustinance, The seuen chambiris  remenant were ordeyned on þis manere. For seven maidenes,
þat lowly serued here with plesance,  Tise were here egipt
eveneldis, to here daliance, Fair of face, bright of ble, as sterre in
þe firmament, With man ne manlchild speke þei, in no manere entent.
In the chief chambir of asneth þer were wyndowys three;  The
firste retardyng to the est, the secunde was south  right,
Te thirde lay north upon þe strete, in swyche manere degre That of
alle that passed by, sche mihte haue a syght. In this chamir a bed was
raid, of goold and purpur bright; Context it was with iacinth and purpur
bise with all: Alone lay asneth in this bed, that riche was and riall.

A gret halle was bild abowte, with wallis wonder hie, With foure yren
gatis spered faste and stronge; And kepte with eyhtene men of armes,
harneised surely. Yet þer were planted inside þe halle  trees faire behonge,


      

With frutes þat were delectable, and fair leues among,  And a
cundite beside þe halle, þat ran as cristall clere,
That moisted the trees lustily, and dide to hem gret chere. The fame of
gentil ioseph sprang gretly, and aroos To alle þe lordis of egipt land,
with gret reuerence; And when he was come into þe cuntre of helinpoleos,
 He sende xii wyse to putiphar preest, seiynge in sentence,
"Greteth the wel oure sire ioseph, and noteth yn aduertence, To dyner at
midday to thi hous, he cometh for his cumfort, In the shade fro the
sunne, to take þere his disport."
And putifar, plesed plesantly, sayd with woise ioiynge,  "Blessed
be the lord god of Ioseph, þat my noble sire Ys comyng toward my hous,
to me yt is plesyng." He called þe prevost of ys hous, & sayd, "I the
require, Make redi a grete feste, and most deynteus to desire, And
gouerne it goodly, I the charge, in þi beste aray,  For ioseph þe
strong man of god schal come to vs this day."
Then herde asneth þat her fadir & her modir bothe Wer come in hervest
fro the feeld of here heritage And sayde, "with ioye I schal go, and se
hem forsothe;" And hasted here forth busyly, agayns hem in passage,
 Clothed comely in bright byse  , lykyng to her lynage, And wrought with goold of iacint, a
girdel of goold þer to, With armillis 
aboute here handis, and here feet also.
A bie  of bright burned goold aboute here nekke
was bent Pyght ful of preciouse stonys, & graue in were all  The
Idolis namys of egipt, plesant to here entent,


      

And aboue here hed was sett a riche coronall, That constreyned here fair
frount, þat was so virginall, Here hed was couered with terestre, & went
forth with plesance And haileed here fadir & here modir, with comely
cunte∣nance. 
Ful curteysly sche kyste hem, and  gretly gan ioye, To se here
doughter so honestly, in riche ornature. The deyntevus frutes of þe
feld, to here þei dide emploie, That delicious were  and
delectable, & noble in nature. Þe mayde reioysed of the frutes, þat were
ful mature,  Of figes, dates, pomgarnettes, & of grapes grete, Of
doue briddes, and thir frutes, þat sauery were & swete.
And putifar sayde to asneth, "The closett dore þe shitte." She did so,
and he here kiste, and saide, "my dowter dere, Novellis nowe I schall
the telle, tend now to my witte,  The myhty man, ioseph, of god,
þis day wil  be here, And he ys gouernour to saue egipt, by
pharao saunz pere, A maide clene as ye be, so virgine he ys speciall; I
schal marie yow to hym, & make yow his conthorall."
And when asneth had herd here fadir þise wordis reherse,  With
straunge yes on hym she loked, here colour gon dis∣teyne, And seide to
hym, "why seie ye thus, my worship to reuerse, To take me caytyf to a
straunger? of hym I haue disdeyne,


      

A futif he ys, by bargayn bouht, & more I say yow pleine, That herdis
son of chanan his lady wold haue fuyled,  In prison therefore he
was put, & all worshyp spuyled.
"And after yt happid þat pharao, as he lay in slepe, Dreyht  was dered in his dremys, diuersely
dremyng, And then this ioseph was take out of the prison depe, To rede
hym right the redeles of his sweuenyng.  The olde wyfis of egipt
han craft in þat cunnyng, And þerfore þat dreme redere I vtterly
forsake, And take me to the kyngis sone, my marie & my make." 
And as putifar with his douhter stood þus talkyng, There come on of his
meyne, and þus to hym saide,  "Ioseph ys come to youre gatis, I do
yow to wytyng." Anf when he spak of ioseph, anon asneth the mayde
Ascended to here cenacle, to the wyndow sche here braide, Þat lay
estward in the chambir of here statly tour,— To se ioseph, for hir fadir
of hym spak gret honour. 
And putifar went forth with his wyf & with his kynrede, To mete with
ioseph, þat gentil Iuge, as man þat was sage; He commaunded þe porteris
sone þe gatis up to sprede, And in entred Ioseph þanne, upon þat
terrage, Standyng on pharaos secunde chare, statli opon stage, 
With foure stronge stoute stedis, þer inne were drawyng, That were white
as the snow, and prowd of here likyng.


      

Þe briddes were fineli gild, the trais of noble atire, Ioseph clothed
was al in white, couered with purpure palle, Wrought with branches of
bright byse, contexit with goold  wire, A coroune of goold on his
heed, þat riche was and rialle, And in þe cercle þerof were sette twelf
stonis imperialle, And aboue the saide stonis, twelf sterris of goold
pure, With a sceptir in his hand, that noble was in nature.
A braunche with beries of oliue tree, in hand he bar with  alle,
Ful plenteus it was of frut, þerin was gret fatnesse; Then entered
Ioseph In at the gatis, & cam in to þe halle, And þe peple was voided
sone, with gret busynesse; The porteris shitte þe gatis faste, with
moche hastynesse, And putifar, his wyf, and his kynred, with worthi
gouer∣nance,  Except asneth, honoured ioseph with obeisaunce.
Ioseph descended of his chaar, glorious to beholde, And tok hem on his
right syde, thankyng in noble wyse. Grett ioye there was mad, among yong
& olde, Save when asneth saw ioseph, here sorwe gan arise,  Here
spirites failed, here bodi trembled, his noblei to dis∣pise, "Alas,"
sche saide, "I haue misdo, dispisyng þis nobil man, When I called hym
herdis sone of the land of chanan."
"And nowe he cometh, as the sunne fro heuen with his bemys, Radiant
richeli in his chaar, with glorious excellence, 


      

Passyng peerles and plesant, in gouer yng of remys, With beaute
bounte he is braced, & grace of influence, Allas! that euere I dispised
hym, or made hym resistence, Godis sone, I wot, is ful noble of
alliance, And the saueour of al egipt, withoute variance. 
"Who was euer gete of a man, so fair, so fresh of face? Or what womman
myghte conceive, & bere so moche light? Of most wrecched now I am,
forfeded I haue hys grace, When I dispurned hym to my fadir, with wordis
unright. Now wyl I hide me fro his face, and kepe fro his sight, 
And yet nothyng fro hym ys hid, he hath so gret cunningge, But mercy,
gret god of ioseph, of my missayngge!
"I wolde my fadir wolde me gife to ioseph in seruice, For euer þerto I
wolde assente, to be his owen seruant." By that had ioseph wasshe his
feet, & in noble wyse  A boord was laid for hym apart, þat was to
hym plesant, For with þe eqiptianis in etyng he was not conuersant, But
escheued heem in here metis, and of hem had drede, And after he spak to
putifar, thus, and to his kynrede,—
"What womman was sche þat, that in þe wyndow stod  Of þe cenacle,
as I cam In? sche ys ageyns my herte, Remeveth here sone out of þis
hous, for marryng of my mod." For ioseph dred wanton wymmen, þe good man
to peruerte, Þerfore he saide, "haue her out that I may be querte." For
he was chast & virgine pure, & clene in continence,  Dredyng with
fere the infeccion of femenyn insolence.


      

And for as moche as þe dowtirs of þe dukys grete of egipt wowed him ofte
tyme, to wanton wikkednesse, Þerfore he fledde here felawship, and ofte
tyme did hem þrete, Tho voyde hem fro þe presence of his pure clennesse;
 Alle faire femelis of egipt he had in heuynesse, For þei desired
to slepe with hym, he was so amiable, But he dispised hem and here
menis, in clennesse he was stable,
Ant saide, "in þe sight of gret god, of my fadir israel, I wyl not synne
in no wyse, but haue in remembrance  The commaundementis of my
fadir, and euer kepe hem wel; For he bad me and my bretheren, with oute
variaunce, To kepe vs clene fro wymmen of straunge alliance, And saide,
þat here felawship wold man with deth destruye, Þerfore haue out þe
straunge womman, nothyng þat sche  me nuye."
Then seyde putifar þus, "my lord, þe womman þat ye saw stande Ys non
alien, but of her Inne, and howre dowhter dere, Hatyng þe cumpanie of
alle men; & more I take an hande, Sche ys virgine pure and clene,
þerfore I pray yow here, That sche may come to yowr presence, & haile
yow with  good chere." And ioseph, gretly ioied, þen, for þat
putifar saide Þat sche loued no man flesly, but lyued a clene maide,
"Þat sche ys a maide," quod ioseph, "I loue here the more, And as myn
own sister, ful wel sche pleseth me; Lett here come anon to me." here
modir went here fore, 


      

And brouhte here to his presence, þat maide fair & fre, Here fadir saide
to here, ful sone, "dowhter, I charge the Salu þi brother, a maide as
þow, of dede & purpos pure, Hatyng alienes & vnclene wymmen, as þu in
thi nature."
Then asneth, nurshid nobely, on knes fair hym grette,  And said,
"hail lord, blessed of god, hie heuene kyng." And ioseph answered,
gentilly, hys wordis to her he sette, "Blisse þe maide þe grete god, þat
quikketh al thyng." Þan said þe fadir, "go kis þi brother, dowhter, on
my blessyng." And asneth wente to kysse hym, after here fadir hestis,
 But ioseph streight his right hand out, & layd yt on here brestis.
And sayd, "sothly, unsemyng and unsittyng hit ys, To the man þat schulde
serue god, and with his mouth hym blesse, And ete the blessed brede of
lyue, and drinke of his chalis, Ony womman alien, or straunger for to
kesse,  Þat blysse mamettis with here mouth, & idolis in liknesse,
That are bothe dumbe and dede, & ete brede of here bord, Ony swych
womman for to kysse, hit lyketh not god my lord.
"But the man þat worshipeth god his modir kysse he schal Hys sister, his
wyf, & his kyndrede, & make hem god  chere."  . . . . . .
Ioseph sayd, "I wil departe upon þis same day, For in þis day god bygan
alle his creature,


      

And here after eyhte dayes, sothly as I þe say, I schal retourne, and
dwelle here, & perto do my cure." Putifar thanne, and his kynrede, with
humblesse of nur∣ture,  Toke at hym his bien aille, with ful
gentil langage, And so dide Ioseph at hym, & toke forth his viage.
And asneth abood, soul, alone, with seuen virgines clene, &, greued with
sorwe, sche wepte sore, to the sunne siled  west, Bred ne
water wolde sche noon, by no maner mene.  When nyht cam, alle þei
slepte, & wente to here rest Saue asneth, wakyng allone, lay knockyng
nere brest. For sche hadde take ful gret drede, & shok with tremblyng,
Sche was constreyned so with sorwe, þat caused here mournyng.
& then sche roos fro here bed, & cam fro her chamber doun,  The
gatis wher portere & his men slepte sure, And to wyndowe faste by sche
busked here ful boun, & there sche drow out a large skyn for here
couuerture, And filde þe skyn ful of askes, and after by aventure Sche
ascended in to here chamber, the doris fast barryng,  And lay doun
on the pavement, and syhed with waylyng.
A virgine, þat asneth loued most, herde of here sobbyng, Alle sixe
virgines here felawys anon sche gan up rere, Þei wente to the chambir
dore, & herde here syhyng, Þei founde the dore lokked faste, þei myhte
hit not vnspere;  Werefore þei cried with vois echon, & callid on
here there,


      

And sayde, "madame what ailes you, and ys your nuysance?"
Asneth opened not here dore, but sayde in þis wyse, "Mi heed yt aketh
 grevusly, on bed þerfore I lye, I am so sik in al my
membris, þat I may not rise,  To open the dore goth fro me; to
your chambres you hie." Þei passed forth as sche bade, and ansneth (sic)
privelye Com to þe chamber where here robis pressed were well, And drow
to here a blacke robe, a cloth of sorwe & deell.
That schee had mad for þe deth of here yungger brother;  With þis
cloth into here chamber sche returned sone, And schytte the dore with
barre & bolt, at trauers upon othir, & in haste dide of here robe, with
ful moche mone, (Þe riall was with bise & goold ful preciously bygone,)
And so sche did here ceynte of goold, þat riche was of valour, 
And did on her þe blake robe, þe vesture of dolour.
Þe coronall þat couered her hed, in the pavement sche yt laide; Here
byes als and bracelettes of riche orfeoure, & in the north part of the
chamber to a wyndow sche brayde, And threw hem out by & by, þat noble
were of feiture,  Here garmentis of goold, and girdelis of gay
garnetture, And alle here godis of goold & siluer, sche tok hem in
haste, With alle þe idolis of egipt, at the wyndow out sche caste.


      

Sche tok here souper araid fore here of wyld foul & fisshes, Þe carcais
als of fatte calfis, and of oþer sacrifice,  Þe vesselis for wyne
of sacrifice, toupes, cuppis, disshes, Cast hem out to straungers
houndis, and so did hem dispise And sayde, "alas how schod my houndis
ete in ony wyse, Of this souper of sacrifice, of fals maumetrie? I take
yt þerfore to straungers houndis, & forsake al ydol∣atrie." 
And after asneth askes tok, & strewed hem in and oute Upon the pauement,
& bond her lendis  with saccloth for penance, And did an heue
 upon here bodi, & bette here breste aboute With bothe handis, &
wepte sore for here ignorance, & laide here doun upon þe askes, with
teres of repentance,  Sobbyn sore with moche sorwe, sett on euery
side, Al the nyth contynuyng so, til þe morwe tyde.
In the mornyng when she roos, with fen sche was fuyled, Þat with þe
teris and askis were medled so in same, Sche fil agayn flatt on here
face, here body so sche spuyled,  And lay þere til hit was nyht,
asneth  by here name. So sche meked here by seuen
daies, þat noble worthi dame, Þe eyhte day þe cokkys crew, þe day bygan
to sprynge, The mayde a lytel lefte up here heed, ful faynt of fastynge.
Aftir she roos on here knees, feble sche was and feynt, 


      

And lifte up here heed a lite, & syhed wondir sore; The maide was meked,
& made megre, & with sorwe atteynt To a wyndow þat lay estwarde sche
dressed here þerfore, & sette here doun undir yt, and saide, "ha lord
thyn ore! What schal I do? were may I go? were schal I haue refute?
 Desolate maide in deserte, of cumfort destitute.
Mi fadir, my modir, & my kyn, þei wel me haue in hate, For I haue
disparplid al her goodis, & cast hem vnderfote, And forsake me for here
douhter, & with me debate, Who may deliuere fro þis daunger, my balis
who may bote?  Yett more ouer in my mynde, with sorwe I mark &
note, Þat al my louers þat me wowed, I hated in alle uyse, Now may þei
glade on my myschief, & utterly me dispise.
"But þe heyhe lord god of ioseph, almyghti in his trone, He ys Ielous
upon his peple, hatyng al idolatrie,  Þerfore, dredful lord, to
þe, now make I my mone, For I haue worshiped fals godis, & mortal
mamettrie, Of here sacrifices I have ete; mercy þerfore I crie, For the
lord god of hebreis ys trewe & mercyable, Long abydyng, mylde and meke,
on hem þat be unstable. 
"He repreueth no maner man, that turneth hym with penance, Þerfore I wil
returne to hym, & fro me synne chace, I wil forsake al my synnes, and
after to his plesance, Yete  out my praieres in his siht, & to
his loue me brace, And yf þat I be repentant, he wil tak me to grace,
 For he is protectour, and defendour, of fadirles children∣alle,
Þerfore to his grete mercy I shall clepe & calle."


      

And þan sche roos out of the place, þer sche satt & stood, To þe
wyndows, þat to þe est parties hadde here regard; And saide, "lord god
of al rightful, þat madest land & flood,  That inspirest al wysdam
in hertis þat ben hard, And makyst þynggis inuisible apparent afterward,
Þat hast enhanced heuen an high & stablyd yt aboue the wyndes, & foundid
land upon þe wateris, as creatour  to al kyndes,
"That hast made þe stonis grete, & wateris of hyght  depnesse,
Conseruyng kyndly þi priaptis,  , and to þi vois
obeisant, Þei wyl nawt offende þi maundementis, for in sekirnesse To al
lyuyng creatures þi word ys lyf plesant, Þerfore I flute,  
lord, to þe, thyn humble suppliant, Crying to þe with my prayer,
in thyn hihe presence,  Confessyng to the, my grete synnes, &
schewe þe my offence.
"Synnyng, lord, I haue synned, ful gretly in þi syght, & worsheped
idolis & maumettis agayns þi mageste, Þerfore to open my mouth to þe,
unworthy I am by right, O lord god, summe tyme I was a proud lay of
degre,  Preferrid in richnesse aboue alle oþer, in worship gret
plente I hadde, but ful desolate and destitute I am forsake, Werefore,
lord, I fle to the, to þi mercy I me betake.


      

"And as þe infaunt, þat sothly soketh his modir breste, For drede fleeth
to the fadyr, to haue of hym socour,  So, lord, I sprede out my
handis, to þe ys al my treste, Take me, lord, & calle me to the, & helpe
me with þi fauour, For þe dwell, þat wod lyoun, will rauesshe me with
errour, For he is fadir of fals godis of al egipt lande, But I haue cast
hem fro me, & destruyed hem with my  hand.
Deliuere me, lord, fro his powere & fro his mouth me drawe, Lest on
happe he rauesshe me ant sle me, þat grett whale, That ys acursyd
eternally, by the sentence of þi lawe. Receyue me, lord, for fadir &
modir refuse me with bale, And seyn, 'asneth is not our douhter,' to
grete & to smale,  'For sche hath destruyed our godis of goold, &
gyfe hem in conculcacioun, To alle men passyng by þe way in gret
abhominacioun.'
"Werefore I fle to þe, my god, þat art of myhtes most, Deliuere me, &
spare me, lord, I haue synned by ignorance. When I called thi child
ioseph, in dispite with my goost,  The heerdis sone of chanan, in
pride of my bobaunce; And now he is aboue alle men, withoute variaunce,
For he þe knoweth for on god, veray lord and trewe, Þerforeþu hast gyfe
wytt to hym, wisdam & vertue.
"Now, good lord, take me to hym to be his hand maide,  And I schal
wassche louly hys feet, subdue me to his seruage, Lernyng þe knowlych of
veray god;" when sche þus had said,


      

The sterre lucifer in þe est shewed his visage, And þerof asneth was ful
glad, & seide in here langage, "Trowest not god hath my prayer herd, þe
messager lo of  lyht Is rise up!" & sodeynly sche saw a selcouth
siht.
Sche saw faste by þe sterre, how heuene partyd in two, & a wondir ful
gret liht lemed out in þat stede, And asneth ferd fel on here face, on
þe askes tho, And a man com doun fro heuen, & stood upon here heed,
 Callyn asneth by here name; sche answered not for dred, And he
called here the secounde tyme, & saide "asneth! asneth!" Then sche
answered, "lo, my lord, & þerwith sche took breth,
And saide, "tel me who þu art," & he answered in haste, "I am a prince
of godis hous, & of hys heuenly ost,  Arise, and stand on thi
feet, & be nothyng agast, And my wordis schal speke to the to cumfort of
þi gost." Sche lyfte þen here heed, & saw a man like almost Ioseph, with
scepter, stole, & coroune, his cheer as lyhtyng leem, & his yes bright
shynyng as doth þe sunne beem. 
The heris of hys heed, þei were as flame of fire brennyng, And asneth,
frayd of þe syhte, fel to his feet for fere, In so moche þat al here
membris were meved with tremb∣blyng. And the aungel saide þenne,
"asneth, nothing the dere. 


      

Be þu cumforted, an rise up, & on þi feet þe rere,  And I schal
speke my wordis to þe after myn entent." And asneth roos upon here feet
at his commaundement.
The aungel saide to asneth, "do of þi blak haire, & thi garnement of
drede, þe saccloth do away, Smyte þe askes fro þi heed, & washe þi face
faire,  & þi handis with rennyng water; do on þi riche aray, Þi
lynnen robe, untouched newe, þat glorious ys & gay, & gird the with þe
double ceynt of þi virginite, And then com to me agayn, & I  schal speke to the."
Asneth hasted forth anon & did as he desired,  And caste on þe
white robe with precious parementis, With double ceynt gird aboute, &
diuersly atired Aboue þe brestis, & on þe lendis gird on here
garnementis, A lynen newe theustre  vail
with riche ornamentis, Here hed was voluped with þat vail, for virginal
excellence,  And returned to þe aungel, & stood in his presence.
Þe aungel saide, "lai don þi wail, discouere þi hed in haste, Why dost
þu thus? þu art maide, þin heed is fair to se, As the heed of a
yonglyng," þe wail away sche caste, The aungel said, "asneth, maide, of
good chere þu be,  Oure lord hath herd þi prayer & þi confession
fre; This fast he saw of vij dayes, & þi lou mekyng, And þe fen, mad of
the askes and of þi gret teryng.
"Be glad, virgine, for þi name ys write in þe book of lif, And schal
neuer de don away, but ay in remembrance, 


      

Lo fro þis day þu art renuwed & quicked fro al strif, And þu schalt ete
of blessyng bred & hue drinke of plesance, Þu schat be enoynted with
holi creme of glorious purveance, And, more, I gif þe in to wyf to
ioseph my dere frend, And ioseph into þi spouse in wordle with oute end.

"And þi name schal be called asneth no more, But hit schal be moche-of-
refute, & so men schul þe calle, For peple schul turne to good by the, I
warne þe bifore, And undir þi wynggis þei schul be couered, tristyng in
god alle, And attendyng to þe hiest god schul be kept in þi walle,
 For thi penaunce hath prayd to hym for þe euery hour, And upon
alle other penantes, in godis name with dolour.
"For penance ys þe dere douhter of hiest god in heuene, And entendyng
upon maidenes and loueþ you gretly, And praieth for you euery hour to
god, I telle þe euene,  And for alle repentant in goddis hie name
mekly, Yt makeþ maidenes to reste in heuene in place arayd sikerly, &
renoueleþ virgines clene to goddis dere blessyng, & purchaceþ (?)  ham ioye and
blisse in wordlis withoute endyng.
"Penaunce is a maide good, glad, and mesurable,  The hiest god
hath here in lond, his angelis in reuerence, I loue here wel, now schal
I go, with oute ony fable, To ioseph, & telle of þe the wordis of my
sentence, And he schal come þis dai to the, & see thyn excellence, And
with ioye loue þe weel, thi spouse be he schall,  & wedded wyf to
hym in wordlis eternall.


      

"& now here me, asneth, maide; do on þi garnementis Of weddyng now in þi
chambre, and atire the with all, And enbclise þi bright beaute, with
preciouse ornamentis, & go forth to mete ioseph, thi spouse speciall,
 For he schal come & see þe, to day, in vesture imperiall." And
after he had endyd his word, asneth, with consolacion, Worshiped hym do
on þe erthe, & said in comendacion,
"Blessed be þi god, most hiest, þat thus þe hath sent, & deliuered me
fro derknesse, & depnesse of my bale,  Blessed euer be his name,
lord god omnipotent." & to þe angel afterward þise wordis sho gan
availe, "What is þi name? tel me sone, & give yt me in tale, Þat I mai
worship & thanke þe, my lord & my frend, & glorifie þi grete name, in
wordle with out ende." 
The angel saide, "my name is write in godis book in heuen, With godis
fynger fore al othir in the bokys bygynnyng, For I am þe prince of godis
hous, & so I tel þe euen, Þat al þat writen is in þat boke, hit passed
mannys spekyng, Inconuenient þerfore yt ys, to eche man vnsyttyng,
 To commune or to here of hem, that are celestiall, For þei be
gret fro mannys mynde, and wonderfull with all."
Thenne seide asneth, "good lord, lat me fynde grace, Þat I mai knowe þat
yt be do, þat þu hast said to me, Gyf thyn handmaide leve to speke in
presence of þi face."  The angel said, "spek on, asneth, þi bone I
graunte the," And sche tok hym by the palle, & said with vois ful free,


      

"I pray the, lord, to sitte a while upon þis bed so clene, For man ne
womman satt neuer þeron by no maner mene.
"And I schall make a bord redy, and offre to your plesir,  Breed
and wyn fro my celer, ful swete & redolent, And when ye haue ete, &
drynke, þen aftir your desire, Ye mai folwe forth your way after your
entent." The aungel saide, "bring yt sone, þerto I consent." And asneth
sette a newe bord with businesse & haste,  And went to fette breed
& wyne plesant to his taste.
The aungel said, "a hony combe bring þu me ful sone." And for sche had
non redy sche stood al dismaid. Sche saide, "I schal send a chyld in to
the feeld anone Of hour heritage, to fette on, sone yt schal be
rayd."  "Entre in to þi celer," the aungel to here saide, "And thu
schalt fynde an hony comb redy on the bord, Take and bryng yt to me;"
and asneth sayd, "my lord,
Knowyth wel þer is non, in no maner of wyse." "Entre þi celer," quod þe
aungel, & on þer schalt þu fynde."  Sche entred in, an hony comb
sche fond of a gret assise, Also white as þe snowe, clene & pure in
kynde, Of odour swete, and asneth meruayled in her mynde, And said,
"trowest not þat of þis comb, þat þis man hath ete, For þe flauour ys as
þe breeth of his mouth so swete." 
And annon sche tok þe comb and afore hym sette, The angel said, "whi
saidest þu, þer was non in þi celer? Now hast þu brouht a ful fair on,
þat was in þi recette."


      

And asneth with gret drede saide in this maner, "Lord, non swych
honycomb in gouernance hadde I there,  But by commaundement of þi
mouth, so yt was do, For the odour þer of ys lik the breth of þi mouth
also."
And þe aungel smyled then, with lauhyng cuntenance, For þe wisdom of
asneth, vpon here intelligence, He called here vnto hym, his right hand
he did hance,  Vpon here heed; schee loked on hym, with shame &
reuer∣ence, He gaf here þen hys benison of gracious influence. He saide
to here, "þu art blessed for  þu hast left þe fay
Of alle maner fals ydolys, and beleuist in god veray.
"And blessed be thei, þat come to god in holy penance,  For þei
schul ete of this comb, þat bees made of paradise, Of the dew of rosis
þere, þat are of gret plesance, The angelis of god schul ete also, þis
comb of prise, And who þat eteth of þe same schal neuer dye in no wyse."
After he brak it and ete a part of þat hony swete,  The remenant
he putte in asneth mouth & bad here to ete.
The aungel saide, "lo, þu hast ete of þe bred of lyf, & þu art enoynted
with holi creme, & þi flesh fro this day Schal be renued, & þi bonys
cured from al strif, And þi vertu neuer faile, þe sothe now I the say.
 Thy Iuuent schal haue non age, þi beaute schal laste ay, Of alle
þat fle to oure lordis name, god & heuene kyng, Thu schalt be as Cite
bild of ioye, withoute endyng."


      

He touched þe comb broke with his hand, hool it was anone, He touched þe
hony with hys fynger upon þe este partie,  He drow his fynger
ageyn to hym to þe west part sone, And þe way of his fynger was mad al
blodi, He drow his fynger þeron fro þe north to þe sowth surly; The way
of hys fynger þer was turned in to blood, And asneth biheld al that he
did, in his lift side sche stood. 
The aungel saide, "vpon þe comb behold & take hede," & bees come oute
þerof ful fele, & white as þe snow, Here wynges were of purpre hewe,
aboute here þei yede, & wrouthe a honycomb in her handis & ete þerof
Inow. The aungel saide þen to þe bees as I schal tel yow,  "Go ye
now in to your place." þei wente toward þe est, Into paradis. þe angel
saide, "asneth, al this þu seest?"
She answered, "ye, my lord," þe aungel saide þenne, "So my wordis schul
be fulfild þat I haue said to þe." Te comb he touched with his hand,
& fire bygan to  brenne, And consumed þe comb anon, not hurtyng
bord ne tre. The fragrant odour of þat brennyng yt was swete & fre.
Asneth saide, "I haue seuen maidenes on o nyght bore, With me, as my
sisteres I loue hem alle þerfore.
"To blesse hem as þu hast me afore þe I hem calle."  "Calle on,"
he saide: sche called sone; þei come to his presence, The aungel saide,
"almyghti god lord blesse you alle, Be ye to þe city of refute seven
pileris in assistence, & alle dwellyng in þat Cite schul reste on your
prudence." The aungel saide to asneth þen, "þis bord awey þu dihte." 


      

Sche turned and saw like a char with foure hors passyng In heuen toward
the est like flame of fire reed, The hors assembling to þe flame, of
þunder leihtnyng Sche saw þe aungel vpon þe char standyng in þat steed,
Þat he was aungel sche was unknowe þerfore sche said  with dreed,
"Alas. I haue spoke with godis aungel, haue mercy on þi hand maide, For
þe wordis I spak in þi presence in ignorance I hem saide."
And asneth yet þus spekyng, a younge man cam ful faste Of þe seruantes
of putifaris, & to here he saide, "Ioseph þe stronge man of god cometh
here in haste,  His messanger ys at þe gate." and asneth forth
sche braide And stood aside in a tresance, sche was ful wel apaide,
Ioseph entred into halle, þe gatis men did spere,  And
shitte out alle straungeris þat no man schul hym dere.
And asneth wente to mete ioseph out of þe tresance goyng.  Ioseph
saw here & gan to wondir upon  beaute bright, For sche was
chaunged & enbelised by þe angelis communyng, & ioseph saide, "who art
þu? telle me anon riht." "I am þi handmaide," quod sche, "to þi
commaundement diht, And alle mamettis I haue do away, & utterli forsake,
 Þe aungel of god fedde me today & heuenly fode me take,


      

And saide, 'I haue gyfe þe today wyf unto Ioseph, And he schal be thi
spouse, in the wordle withoute ende; & saide my name, schulde no more be
called asneth, But Cite of refute and þi lord god schal þe sende, 
'Moche peple þat þu schale turne & to almyhty god wende' He saide me
more, 'to ioseph forth now schal I passe, And speke  þise
wordis in his eris, of þe more & lasse.'
"Now þu knowyst, my lord Ioseph, yf þe aungel cam to þe, And spoke to þe
of me the wordis þat I shewe."  Þen ioseph sayde, "of hiest god,
asneth, blessed þu be, & þi name, in kynredis blessed of kynredes schal
renewe, For god of heuen loued þe & send me his angel trewe, & spake of
the to me þise wordis; & þerfore, maide com ner, What ys þe cause þu
standist fro me now so fer?" 
And ioseph streihte out his hand, & loueli gan her brace, Þei kiste þen
bothe in same with cuntenance excellent, Then saide sche, "my lord
Ioseph, entre into oure place." Sche ladde hym in by þe right hand, here
fadir was absent, Sche broughte water to wasse his feet, with ful trewe
entent,  And he asked anoþer maide to whasshe ys fete þere, And
asneth saide, "I schal hem wasshe, ye ar my lord dere,
"Fro hennys forth I am þin awne þi handmaid & þi thrall, Whi askest þu
anothir maide to wasshe þi feet here? Thi feet ar myn owne feet, þi
handdis also with all,  And þi soule ys my soule, þu are thn myn
owne fere." Sche constreyned hym & weesh hys feet with ful good chere.


      

And he behold here faire handis of beaute þer was no misse He tok here
by þe right hand and louely did here kysse.
He made here þen sitte by hym vpon his right hand;  Here fadir
here modir & here kynreed com out of þe feld Of here heritage, and
wondering stil thei gan stande. The glorious beaute of here douhter
mervaillus þei beheld. Thei saw here sitte with ioseph, reuerence to hym
þei yeld. More þei mervailed þat sche wered on þe stole of here
wed∣dynge,  And after þei ete & drinke togedir, gretly enioynge.
Then saide putifar to ioseph, "to morwe I schal calle Alle þe
gouernouris of pharoa and princes of egipt lande, And make espousailes
vnto you, my douhter take þu schalle, Vnto þi wyf." þen saide ioseph,
"thu schalt vnderstande,  I schal go myself tomorwe, and þat werke
take on hande, & speke to pharao of egipt kyng, my fadir of gret honour,
Of al his land he hath me mad chief prince & gouernour.
"And I schal speke in his eris of asneth plesantly, And he schal yeve
here me to wyf with solempnite."  Then said putifar, "go forth
with pees ful obeisantly," But with putifar he dwelled al nyght with
tranquillite, And with asneth sclepte he not, but said in verite "His is
no right þat a man þat wirshipeth god an hihe Afore espousailes in no
wyse with his wyf to lye." 
Ioseph ros vp tymely, to kynge pharao he goes, And said, "graunte me to
wyf asneth, þe maide reuerent,


      

The douhter of preest putifar of olinpoleos." & pharao saide, "to þe,
ioseph, Þe maide is congruent, For sche is a maide clene as thu, tak to
her to þin entent.  Be sche to þe þi dere spouse in wordle
euerlastynge." And pharao send to putifar his douhter forth to bringe.
Afore pharao asneth stood in his hihe presence And he wondering on here
beaute, "endure with þe For ay * * * * * The rightful god of ioseph hath
chose þe his spouse today,  * * * * * And ioseph is called the
sone of god of hih dignite, And þu schalt be called his owen spouse in
perpetuite."
Pharao þen tok hem bothe and here hedis frette With crounys of pure
gold, þat riche wer of atire, Upon þe right side of ioseph asneth þen he
sette,  And laide his handis on here hedis & saide in his desire,
"Blesse you now þe lord god of þe heuenly empire, And fulfille you
eternally with glorie, ioye, and blisse." And after turned hem mouth to
mouth, & togedir did hem kysse.
And after pharao dide þe weddynges to be solempnised,  Callyng
alle princes and gouernours of egipt land þerto, A rial feste by seuen
dayes during was deuised, And pharao declaret a newe decree to alle hys
land also, Sayngge, "what man þat ony werke euer here after do In the
day, þat ioseph & asneth were wedded inne,  Thei schul dye in
grevus deth, for that gret synne."
And after Ioseph knewe his wyf sche conceived sone, And bar manasses &
effraim, þis was here procreacion,


      

And aftir asneth seurly to god sche mad here mone, Remembering here olde
synne by prive meditacion,  And after mournyng þus sche saide,
 with gret lamentacion, "Lord, synned I haue
synned, moche synned in þi presence, Asneth, dowhter of putifar, pardone
myn offence.
"Most foulest in my fadir hous I was of gouernance, A maide enhansed &
right proud, I haue synned, lord, to þe,  Fals godis herid with
oute nombre to my daliance, & ete bred of her sacrifice so synned in þat

"And of the lord of heuene I was ignoraunt, Not tristyng in þe hihe god
þat art lyf eternall; I haue synned, lord, in þi presence, my synne is
displiant. For I triste on my richesse & my beaute with alle, I haue
synned, lord, lift up with pride, confesse so I schall,  I was
dispisyng euery man on erthe with errour, Ther stood neuer man in my
presence þat I gaf fauor.
"Alle my woweris I dispised, of hem I hadde disdeyn. Synned, lord, I
haue synned in presence of þi face, For I saide, þer was no prince with

Synnyng, lord, I haue synned contynuyng in þi presence, Til ioseph þe
myhty man of god tok me with excellence,


      

"For as þe fyssh by the hook ys take by distresse,  So ys beaute
drow me to hym by vertuus prouydence; And ladde me to almighty god with
gret gentylesse,  And did me taste of þe drynke of he
eternal sapience, And now I am mad his conthorall by his aduertence Ay
to dwelle with hym in wordle with oute ende,  Synned, lord, I haue
synned remission þu me sende."
And after seven yeer were passed of plentevus abundance Þer bygunne
seuen yeer of hunger scars & chere, And Iacob herd of Ioseph, and with
gret plesance, He com into egipt land with his kynrede in fere, 
In the secunde monthe the secunde yeer when vitaile was dere, The on and
twenti day of þe monthe, Israell cam don then And descended with his
kynred into þe land of iessen.
Then saide asneth to ioseph, "the fadir I schal go se, For a god he is
to me, þi fader israel."  & ioseph saide, "to se hym com now forth
with me." And þei com to iacob to þe land of iessen well. And ioseph
bretheren mette hem with reuerence & reuell; Þei wirshiped hym, don upon
þe erthe louely obeyng, Thei entred in to iacob where was his loggyng.

Israel sittyng on his bed, old & of gret age, Asneth saw hym & meruailed
for iacob was good in sight, Of hys age ful reuerent, as youthe of fair
parage, His heed white as þe snow, his berd to þe brest right, Al white
was sittyng, and his yees schynyng as liht, 


      

Hys synewes schuldirs & his armes were stable & vailant, Hys knes
schynys ant his feet like to a geaunt.
And asneth salued hym on here knes with humble conte∣nance, Then said
iacob to ioseph, "my sone thy wyf þis is?" He said, "ye." þan iacob this
wordis to here gan vance,  "Blessed be thu, doughter of hiest
god," & after he did here kys. And after þei ete & drunke togedir, with
gret ioy & blys, And þenne Ioseph & asneth afore hem were sente.
In the right side of asneth was leuy in assistence,  And symeon þe
left partie wente by & by, & asneth loued leuy wel for hys intelligence.
And after as sche in pharaois hous walked plesauntly, Pharaois sone
beheld here as he loked an hy, Þat was his firste bygeten child, his
sone & his here.  Anon he brente on here for loue, her beaute was
so fair.
Wherefore he languyshed for loue, & nyste what to do. But sone he sente
messagers to symeon & leui, Þat were þe bretheren of ioseph, & thus said
hem to: "I knowe wel þat ye are men stronge and mihty,  And meny a
sichym ye han slayn with swerd manfully, And now I pray you tenderly for
to helpe me, I schal you gife goold & siluer & men gret plente.
"Seruantis assis & chamelis to youre lote schal falle I warne you þat to
your brother I haue gret enuye,  For he hath asneth to his wyf,
ordeyned me first of alle.


      

Þerfore asneth now to me, on my swerd schal he dye, Asneth to spouse þen
schal I haue I tel you trulye. Then schal I take you as my brethere
tristy & trewe And yf ye dispise my cunseil sore ye schul yt rewe. 
"For my swerd ageyns you þen schal I araye." Then spak leui unto hym
with riht bolde chere, "Wherto speketh my lord þise wordis us to afraye?
We are men þat worship god, ant oure fadir dere Ys þe child of his god
and our brother in al manere  Ys dredyng gretly god, thi word hou
schul we do? To synne so in godis presence & oure fadirs also.
"Therefore heer now my wordis & do not þyn entent, For howre brother tok
here not of his owen acceptance, But by the lawe of thi fadir & of his
consent,  And yf þu dwelle in þi purpoos of wykked purueance, Oure
swerdis, lo, in our handis wyt þe in variance, In þi presence with oure
brother ful redi for to dye." And when pharaois sone herd þis, he dred
hem gretlye.
Then symeon and leui went out fro his presence,  And pharaois sone
was replete with sorwe, drede, & ire. To iniure he dradde ioseph for his
gret prudence. Yet on þe beaute of asneth his corage was a fire, His
meyne þen saide unto hym, to plesance of his desire, "Lo þe sonys of
handmaides to rachell & to lye,  Of bale and of zelphe to ioseph
haue envye.
"Þei wil be redy to do þi wil;" & forth þei were fett, & pharaois sone
vnto hym þen did hem calle,


      

& saide, "lo, here lyf and deth afore your face ys fett. Taketh þe lyf
and not þe deth, I cunseyl you with al.  I herde ioseph sey to my
fadyr, þat ye wer children þral 'And not my bretheren, I abyde hem
vtterly to destruye After the deth of my fadir & al here generacion nuye,
Thei schul neuer enherite with vs, þe sonis of seruage, Þise solde
 me to þe Ismalitis, I schal yelde he malice,  Þat
þei maligned ageyns me in here gret outrage.' My fadyr pharao preised
hym & said þat he was wyse And saide 'I schal werke with þe after þi
deuyse.' And after þei hadde herde þise wordis of þe sone of pharao, Þei
said troubled gretly "lord  schal we do?" 
He saide, "my fadir pharao I schal sle þis nyht, For he is as fadir to
ioseph & loueth hym gretly, And ye youre brother ioseph to deth ye schul
dyht, Þen schal I haue asneth to wyf, þat fair is & louely, & ye schul
haue part of myn heritage as my brethre tristy.  Þen saide þe
bretheren Gad & dan, "þi men lord we be, What þu cumaundis hit schal be
do & more we telle þe.
"We herde ioseph to asneth saie to morwe þu schal go Into felde of
howere heritage for now is heruest seson And commaundet six hundred men
to passe with here also,  Commaunde vs, lord, mo fihtynge men þat
we may by reson Go afore hem on þe nyht & leye a bushment with treson,
Bi the brook & hide vs þere in the spers of þe redis, And tak with the
fyve hundred archeris what so euer nedis,


      

"And go afore vs a good way fert out in lengthe,  And asneth with
ynne our bushment þen come schalle, & we schulle sle here men echon, þat
be with here by strenthe, And asneth wil fle on here char & in our
handis falle, Þu schalt parfourme þen þi wil and thi desires alle, Then
schul we ioseph & hys children sle byfore þi ye."  When pharaois
sone þise wordis herde, he enyoyed gretly
And sende to hem two þousand þat armed were briht, Þei wente and hidde
hem by þe broke in þeed  slily, & pharaois sone roos up
on the same nyht, And com to his fadir chamber to entre in prively.
 His fadir wacche forbad hit hym, & told þe cause why, "Thi fadir
hed of wacche it aketh & now reste hath take, He forbad entre to euery
man þat non scholde hym wake."
And when he herde þise wordis he departed þan, And toke five hundred
archiris, afore þe gate he wente,  After þat þat yt was spoke
bothe by gad ant dan. And asneth aros tymely to ioseph sche here mente,
"I go to þe feld of oure heritage after þyn entente, But sory dredeth
now my soule þat we schul parted be." Ioseph said "dred nothyng, for god
is with þe, 
And schal kepe the fro al disese, as þe appel of þe ye, For I schal go
and gif bred to þe land aboute." And bothe þenne þei toke here way, &
asneth cam bye Vpon the brook, and six hundred men with here in a route,
And sodeynly the husment brake on hem a shoute,  And slowe hem
ful cruelly in þe egge of the swerde, And beniamin fledde with asneth
 on here char aferd.


      

A man þer scaped away, þat was with asneth there, And told leui and his
brother in haste of the afrai. Men of armes þei tok forth, hors,
harneis, and geer,  & after asneth quicly thei folwed on the way,
And sone in haste þei come there þat þe busment lay, And fille on hem
sodeinly, & gaf hem dethis wounde, Gad & dan entred þe redis & hid hem
þat stounde.
Beniamyn, abydyng with asneth, saw pharaois sone com on  To sette
hand upon here, þerof he was war, In the lift side of þe sculle he smote
hym with a ston, Þat fro his hors with þe same to þe grounde he hym bar,
As good as ded þere he lay, he gaf hym swych a scar. His horsmen and
archeris when þei saw þat siht,  Þei fledde to þe redis & hidde
hem þer right.
When beniamyn saw symeon & leui comynge He was glad, and gaf asneth
wordis of good chere, And after þei assembled ful gretly enioynge
Askynge after gad and dan yf þei sawe hem there,  Willyng to haue
slayn hem with purpos entere, But asneth saw þei souhte her brether to
sle hem in rage, And myldely with softe wordis her wath sche gan swage.
"Ye schal not now do þis þynge, youre brethere þei be, Of the kynde of
youre fadir and yf ye slowe hem so,  Ye schulde be repref to alle
men tristeþ to me, And make your fadir sori & sette his hert in wo." And
when sche hadde þus said her ire swaged tho, Aftir þei tok up pharaois
sone, þe blood fro hym wasshyng, And sette hym on a hors, his wondis
softe byndyng; 


      

Þen þei laidede hym to hys fadir, & told hym more & myn. Pharao thanked
gretly god þat he was not slayn, Þe þridde day he was ded be þe wounde
of beniamin, And pharao sorwed sore for hym and gretly did complayn, And
þat sorwe with sikenesse so sore gan hym constrayn  Þat pharao
dide in þe age of nynty & nyne yeer, Leuynge his kyngdom to ioseph þat
was hym leef & deer.
Ioseph regned nobeli þere wyth gret prosperite Fourty yeer and eyht, ful
graciously gouernynge, And after he gaf his diademe to pharaois sone
fre,  Þat was at his fadir deth at þe brest soukyng, And ioseph
was called in egipt fadir to þe kyng. Þus endeth the storie of asneth to
youre remembrance, My rude translacion I pray you tak hit with plesance.


        

Ha, cruell deeth! contrarious to creatures in kynde,  Ha, deeth
dispitous! who may aduertise Thi mourther, thi malice, who may haue in
mende The myschief, that to mankynde þu dost exercise? Thi rigour, þi
rancour who may devyse? The matyng of þi miserie no man may endure,
 For thi chekkes conclude eueri creature.
Thu are to alle creatures hidous to beholde, Thu pyllour, thu pirate,
cesse of þi prise. Thi felonye ys multiplied in so many folde That al
the worlde generally of the, deþ, agrise.  Stynt of þi malice, for
wyth thy malgyse Louers ful lykynge and lusty in game Thu marrest with
myschief, and makest hem lame.


      

Thu tyraunt on emperat, with thi tene & treson, Thi solas of soueraignes
þu dost siluestrise,   And ladies likyng thu sleest out of seson, And
reuest hem here ryalty with þi reprise, Thyn insaciable malice who may
acomplise? When þat loueli ladies thu leyest so lowe And here bright
beaute þu blemishest in a throwe. 
For þi malice me semeth reames sholde arise, To destruye cruell deeth,
and do hym of dawe— But oon wynked on me then "war quod þe wyse, And
cesse of þi sentence for symple is þi sawe, For deeth vniuerselly the
worlde schal vengyse,  So ys the tyraunt tytled to that uictorie,
By adam the alderman of old auncetrie."
Then sorwed I that sentence recouered by assise, And mourned for my
maystresse here marred in molde. There ys countour ne clerk bounte can
decyse,  In vertu here wommanhed was volupid many folde. Discreet,
devoute, diligent, deeth, thu mayst agrise To represse so noble, so
gentill a creature, In tendir age vntymely agayn the ordir of nature.
O myghty lord, wos goodnesse neuer schal fynyse,  Haue mercy on
the soule of my dere maistresse. The fendis power fro that soule chare &

here in thi place of plesaunt paradise,


      

And receyue here blyssed lord upon thi right side,  In they blysse
eternally wyth  the to abyde.
Of lordis lyne & lynage sche was, here sche lyse, Bounteuus benigne,

LItell Lowys my sone, I haue perceiued well by certeyne euidences thine
abilite to lerne sciencez touchinge noumbres & proporciouns;  & as wel
considere I thy bisi preyere in special to lerne the tretis of the
astrelabie.  than, for as mechel as a philosofre seith,  he wrappeth
him in his frend, þat condescendith to the rihtful preiers of his
frend  therfor haue I geuen the a suffisaunt astralabie as for owre
orizonte, compowned after the latitude of Oxenford  vpon which, by
mediacion of this litel tretis, I purpose to teche the a certein nombre
of conclusions apertenyng to the same instrument.  I seye a certein of
couclusiouns, for thre causes.  the furste cause is this:  truste wel
þat alle the conclusiouns that han ben fownde, or elles possibli myhten
be fownde in so noble an instrument as an astralabie, ben vnknowe
perfitly to any mortal man in this regioun, as I suppose.  another
cause is this ; þat sothly, in any tretis of the astrelabie þat I haue
seyn, there ben some conclusions þat wole nat in alle thinges performen
hir byhestes;


      

 & some of hem ben to harde to thy tendre age of .x. yer to conseyue. 
this tretis, diuided in 5 parties, wole I shewe the vnder ful lihte
rewles & naked wordes in englissh ; for latyn ne kanstow yit but smal,
my lite sone.  but natheles, suffise to the thise trewe conclusiouns in
englissh, as wel as suffisith to thise noble clerkes grekes thise same
conclusiouns in grek,  & to arabiens in arabik,  & to Iewes in Ebrew,
& to the latyn folk in latyn  whiche latyn folk han hem furst owt of
othre diuerse langages, & writen in hir owne tonge, þat is to sein, in
latyn.  & god wot, þat in alle this langages, & in many mo, han
thise conclusiouns ben suffisantly lerned & tawht  & yit by diuerse
rewles, ryht as diuerse pathes leden diuerse folk the rihte wey to
Roome.  Now wol I prey mekly euery discret persone þat redith or herith
this litel tretis, to haue my rewde endytyng for excused, & my
superfluite of wordes, for two causes.  the firste cause is, for that
curios enditing & hard sentence Is ful heuy atones for swich a child
to lerne.  & the seconde cause is this, þat sothly me semeth betre to
writen vnto a child twies a good sentence, than he forget it ones. 
And lowis, ȝif so be þat I shewe the in my lihte Englissh as trewe
conclusiouns touching this matere, & nawht only as trewe but as many &
as subtil conclusiouns as ben shewed in latyn  in ani commune
tretis of the astrelabie  kon me the more thank ;  and preye god saue
the kyng, þat is lord of this langage, & alle that him feyth bereth &
obeieth, euerech in his degree, the more and the lasse.  but considere
wel, that I ne vsurpe nat to haue fownde this werk of my labour or of
myn engin.  I nam but a lewd compilatour of the labour of olde
Astrologens, and haue hit translated in myn englissh only for thi
doctrine ;  & with this swerd shal I slen envie.


      

 The firste partie of this tretis shal reherse the figures & the
membres of thin Astrolabie, bycause þat thow shalt han the grettre
knowyng of thin owne instrument.

 The second partie shal teche the werken the verrey practik of the
forseide conclusiouns, as ferforth & as narwe as may be shewyd in so
smal an instrument portatif aboute.  For wel wot euery astrologien þat
smalest fraccions ne wol nat ben shewid in so smal an instrument, as in
subtil tables calkuled for a kawse.

 The .3. partie shal contienen diuerse tables of longitudes & latitudes
of sterres fixe for the Astrolabie,  & tables of declinacions of the
, & tables of longitudes of Citeez & of townes ;  & as wel for
the gouernance of a clokke as for to fynde the altitude Meridian  &
many nother notable conclusioun, aftur the kalendres of the reuerent
clerks, frere I. Somer & frere N. Lenne.

 The .4. partie shal ben a theorik to declare the Moeuynge of the
celestial bodies with  causes.  the whiche 4 partie in special shal
shewen a table of the verray Moeuyng of the Mone from howre to howre,
euery day  & in euery signe, after thin Almenak  vpon wych
table ther folwith a canon, suffisant to teche as wel the maner of the
wyrkyng of þat same conclusioun  as to knowe in owre orizonte with wych
degree of the zodiac that the Mone arisith in any latitude  & the
arising of any planete aftur his latitude fro the Ecliptik lyne.

 The .5. partie shal ben an introductorie aftur the statutz of owre
doctours, in which thow maist lerne a gret part of the general rewles of
theorik in Astrologie.  in which .5. partie shaltow fynde tables of
equacions of howses aftur þe latitude of Oxenford;  & tables of
dignetes of planetes  & other noteful thingez  yif god wol vouche sauf
& his modur the mayde, mo than I behete, &c.


      


      Her bygynneth the descripcion of the Astrelabie.


        

 Thyn Astrelabie hath a ring to putten on the towmbe of thy ryht
hand in takyng the heyhte of thynges.  & tak kep, for from hennes
forthward, I wol clepe tho heyhte of any thing þat is taken by thy
rewle, the altitude, withowte mo wordes.


        

 This ring rennyth in A Maner turet, fast to the Moder of thyn
Astrelabie, in so Rowm a space þat hit desturbith nat the instrument to
hangen aftur his rihte centre.




        

 The moder of thin Astrelabie is  thikkeste plate, perced with a
large hole, þat resseyuyth in hir wombe the thynne plates compowned for
diuerse clymatz, & thi Riet shapen in manere of a net or of a webbe of a
loppe ; & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


        

 This Moder is deuyded on the bakhalf with a lyne, þat cometh
dessendinge fro the ryng down to the nethereste bordure.  the whiche
lyne, fro þe forseide Ryng vnto the centre of the large hole amydde,
is cleped the sowth lyne, or elles the lyne Meridional.  & the remenant
of this lyne downe to the bordure is cleped the north lyne, or elles the
lyne of Midnyht.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


      




        

 Ouerthwart this forseide longe lyne, ther crosseth hym another lyne
of the same lengthe from est to west. Of the whiche lyne, from a lityl
croys + in the bordure vnto the centre of the large hole, is cleped the
Est lyne, or elles the lyne Orientale ;  & the remenant of this lyne
fro the forseide + vnto the bordure, is cleped the west lyne, or the
lyne occidentale.  now hastow her the 4 quarters of thin astrelabie,
deuyded after the 4 principals plages or quarters of the firmament.  &
for the more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


        

 The est side of thin Astrelabie is cleped the riht side,  & the west
side is cleped the left side.  forget nat this, lite lowys.  put
the ring of thin Astralabie vpon the thowmbe of thy ryht hand, and
thanne wole his right side be toward thy left side, & his left side wol
be toward thy right side ; tak this rewle general, as wel on the bak as
on the wombeside.  vpon the ende of this est lyne, as I first seide,
is marked a litel +, wher as eueremo generaly is considered the entring
of the first degree in wich the sonne arisith.  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here þe figure.




        

 Fro this litel + vp to the ende of the lyne Meridional, vndur the
ryng,  shaltow fynden the bordure deuyded with 90 degres ; & by that
same proporcioun is euery quarter of thin Astrolabie deuyded.  ouer the
wiche degrees ther ben nowmbres of augrym, þat deuyden thilke same
degres fro 5 to 5, as shewith by longe strykes bytwene.  of wyche longe
strykes the space by twene contienith a Milewey.  & euery degree of
the bordure contieneth 4 Minutes, that  to seyn, minutes of an
howre.  & for more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


      




        

 Vnder the compas of thilke degres ben writen the names of the 12
signes, as Aries, taurus, gemini, Cancer, leo, virgo, libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces & the nombres of the degres
of tho signes ben writen in Augrim aboue, & with longe deuysiouns, fro 5
to 5 ; deuyded fro tyme þat the signe entreth vnto the laste ende. 
but vndorstond wel, þat thise degrees of signes ben euerich of hem
considered of 60 Mynutes, & euery Minute of 60 secondes, & so forth in
to smale fraccions infinit, as seith Alkabucius.  & therfor, know wel,
þat a degree of the bordure contienith 4 Minutis, and a degre of a signe
contienith 60 Mynutis, & haue this in Mynde.  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


        

 Next this folwyth the cercle of the dayes, þat ben figured in maner of
degrees, þat contienen in nowmbre 365 ; dyuyded also with longe strikes
fro 5 to 5, & the nombre in Augrym writen vnder þat cercle.  and for
more declaracioun, loo heere thy figure.




        

 Next the cercle of tho dayes folweth the Cercle of the names of the
Monthes ; þat is to seyen, Ianuare, Februare, Marcius, Aprile, Mayus,
Iuyn, Iulius, Augustus, Septembre, October, Novembre, Decembre.  the
names of thise Monthes were cleped in Arabyens, somme for hir propretes,
& some by statutz of lordes, some by other lordes of Rome.  ek of thise
Monthes, as liked to Iulius cesar & to cesar Augustus, some were
compowned of diuerse nombres of dayes, as Iuyl and August.  thanne hath
Ianuare xxxi daies, Februare 28, March 31, Aprille 30, May 31, Iunius
30, Iulius 31, Augustus 31, September 30, Octobre 3l, Nouembre 30,
December   natheles, althow that Iulius cesar tok 2 daies owt of
Feuerer & put hem in his monith of Iuylle, & Augustus cesar cleped


      

the Monyth of August After his name & ordeyned it of 31 daies, yit
truste wel, þat the sonne dwelleth therfor neuere the more ne lesse in
on signe than in another.


        

 Than folwen the names of the halidayes in the kalender & next hem the
lettres of the A. b. c. on wich they fallen.  & for the more
declaracioun, loo here thi figure.




        

 Next the forseide cercle of the A. b. c., vnder the croslyne, is
Marked the skale, in Maner of 2 Squyres or elles in Manere of laddres,
þat seruith by hise 12 poyntes & hise deuisiouns of ful many a subtil
conclusioun. Of this forseide skale, fro the crooslyne vnto the verre
angle, is clepid vmbra , & the nether partie is cleped the vmbra
  & for the more declaracioun, loo here
the figure.


        

 Thanne hastow a brod Rewle, þat hath on either ende a Square plate
perced with a certein holes, some more & some lesse, to resseyuen the
stremes of the sonne by day, and ek by mediacioun of


      

thyn Eye, to knowe the altitude of sterres by nyhte { & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure


        

 Thanne is ther a large Pyn in maner of an Extre, þat goth thorow the
hole  that halt the tables of the clymates & the Riet in the wombe of
the Moder  thorw wich pyn ther goth a litel wegge which þat is cleped
the hors, þat streynet alle thise parties to hepe ; this forseide
grete Pyn in maner of an extre is ymagynd to be the Pol Artyk in thin
Astralabie.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.




        

 The wombeside of thyne Astrelabie is also deuyded wit a longe
croys in 4 quarters from est to West, fro sowth to north, fro riht side
to left side, as is the bakside. & for the more declaracioun, lo here
thi figure.


        

 The bordure of which wombeside is deuyded fro the poynt of the est
lyne vnto the poynt of the south lyne vnder the ring, in 90 degres ; &
by þat same proporcioun is euery quarter deuyded as ys the bakside, þat
amonteth 360 degres.  & vnderstond wel, þat degres of this Bordure ben
answering & consentrik to the degrees of the Equynoxial, þat ys deuyded
in the same nombre as euery othere cercle is in the heie heuene.  This
same bordure is deuyded also with 23 lettres capitals & a smal croys +
aboue the south lyne, þat shewith the 24 howres equals of the clokke 
&, as I haue said, 5 of thise degrees maken a Milewey, & 3 Milewey maken
an howre.  & euery degree of this bordure contineth 4 Mynutes, &


      

euery Minut 60 secoundes ; now haue  told the twye  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here the figure.




        

 The plate vnder thi Riet is descriued with 3  cerclis ; of
wiche the leste is cleped the cercle of cancer  bycause þat the heued
of cancer turnyth euermor consentrik vpon the same cercle.  in this
heued of cancer is the grettest declinacioun northward of the sonne.  &
therfor is he cleped the Solsticioun of somer;  wiche declinacioun ,
aftur ptholome, is 23 degrees & 50 Minutis, as wel in cancer as in
Capricorne. this signe of cancre is cleped the tropik of Somer, of
tropos, þat is to seyn Agaynward, for thanne bygynneth the sonne to
passe fro vsward ;  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.



 The Middel cercle in wydnesse, of thise 3, is cleped the cercle
equinoxial  vpon whiche turneth euermo the hedes of aries & libra.  &
vnderstond wel, þat euermo this cercle equinoxial turnyth Iustly fro
verrey est to verrey west;  as I haue shewed the in the sper solide. 
this same cercle is cleped also the weyere, equator, of the day  for
whan the sonne is in the heuedes of aries & libra, than ben the daies &
the nyht illike of lenghthe in al the world.  & therfore ben thise
two signes called the equinoxiis.  & alle þat Moeuyth within the
heuedes of thise aries & libra, his Moeuyng is cleped northward  &
alle that Moeuyth withoute thise heuedes, his Moeuyng is clepid sowth
ward as fro the equinoxial.  tak kep of thise latitudes north and
sowth, & forget it nat.  by this cercle equinoxial ben considered the
24 howres of the clokke ; for eueremo the arisyng of 15 degrees of the
equinoxial maketh an howre equal of the clokke.  this equinoxial is cleped


      

the gyrdelle of the firste Moeuyng, or elles of the angulus primi motus
vel primi mobilis. And nota, þat firste Moeuyng is cleped "Moeuyng" of
the firste Moeuable of the 8 spere, whiche Moeuyng is fro est to west, 
& eft agayn into est  also it is clepid "girdel" of the first Moeuyng,
for it departeth the furste Moeuable, þat is to seyn, the spere, in 2
ilike parties, euene distantz fro the poles of this world.

The wydeste of thise 3 principal cerkles is cleped the cercle of
capricorne, bycause þat the heued of capricorne turnyth euermo
consentryk vpon the same cercle  in the heued of this forseide
capricorne is the grettest declinacioun sowthward of the sonne, & ther
for is it cleped the solsticioun of wyntur. this signe of capricorne is
also cleped the tropik of wyntur, for thanne bygynnyth the sonne to come
agayn to vsward.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.




        

 Vpon this forseide plate ben compassed certein cerclis þat hihten
Almicanteras  of which som of hem semen perfit cercles, & somme semen
inperfit. the centre þat standith aMiddes the narwest cercle is cleped
the senyth;  & the netherest cercle, or the furste cercle, is clepid
the orisonte,  þat is to seyn, the cercle


      

þat deuydeth the two Emysperies  þat is, the partie of the heuene a
boue the Erthe & the partie benethe.  thise almykanteras ben
compowned by 2 & 2, al be it so þat on diuers Astrelabies some almy
kanteras ben deuyded by on  & some by two, & somme by .3. aftur the
quantite of the Astrelabie. & this forseide cenyth is ymagened to ben
the verrey point ouer the crowne of thyn heued  & also this senyth is
the verrey pool of the orisonte in euery regioun.  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


        

 From this senyth, as it semeth, ther come a maner krokede strikes like
to the clawes of a loppe, or elles like to the werk of a womanes calle,
in keruyng ouerthwart the Almykanteras.  & thise same strikes or
diuisiouns ben cleped Azymuthz.  & they deuyden the Orisonte of thin
astrelabie in 24 deuisiouns.  & thise Aȝimutz seruen to knowe the
costes of the firmament  & to othre conclusiouns, as for to knowe the
cenyth of the sonne & of euery sterre.  & for  more declaracioun,
lo here thi figure.




        

 Next thise azymutz, vnder the cercle of Cancer, ben ther 12 deuysiouns
embelif, moche like to the shap of the azimutes, þat shewen the spaces
of the howres of planetes  & for mor declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


        

 The riet of thin Astrelabie with thy zokiak, shapen in maner of a net
or of a lopwebbe aftur the olde descripcioun, which thow maist tornen
vp and down as thiself likyth, contienith certein nombre of sterres
fixes, with hir longitudes & latitudes determynat;


      

 ȝif so be þat the makere haue nat erred. the names of the sterres ben
writen in the Margyn of the riet ther as they sitte;  Of whiche sterres
the smale poynt is cleped the Centre  And vnderstond also þot alle
sterres sittinge wythin the zodiak of thin astrolabie ben cleped
sterres of the north,  For thei Arisen by northe the est lyne.  & alle
the remenant fixed, owt of the zodiak, ben cleped sterres of the sowth;
 but y sey nat þat they arisen alle by southe the est lyne ; witnesse
on aldeberan & Algomeysa.  generally vnderstond this rewle, that thilke
sterres þat ben cleped sterres of the north arisen rather than the
degree of hire longitude, & alle  sterres of the sowth arisen aftur
the degree of hire longitude; this is to seyn, sterres fixed in thin
Astralabie. the mesure of this longitude of sterres is taken in the lyne
Eclyptik of heuene, vnder which lyne, whan that the sonne & the Mone ben
lyneriht or elles in the superfice of this lyne  than is the Eclips of
the sonne or of the Mone ; as y shal declare, & ek the cause why. but
 sothly the Ecliptik lyne of thy zodiak is the owttereste
bordure of thy zodiak, ther the degrees ben marked.

 Thy zodiak of thin Astralabie is shapen as a compas wich þat
contienith a large brede, as aftur the quantite of thin astralabie  in
ensample þat the zodiak in heuene is ymagened to ben a superfice
contienyng a latitude of 12 degrees,  wher al the remenant of
cerkles in the heuene ben ymagined verrey lynes withowte eny latitude.
 Amiddes this celestial zodiak ys ymagined a lyne, which þat is cleped
the Ecliptik lyne  vndur which lyne is euermo the wey of the sonne. 
Thus ben ther 6 degrees of the zodiak on þat on side of the lyne, and 6
degrees on that other.  This zodiak is


      

deuided in 12 principa1 deuisiouns, þat departen the 12 signes.  &, for
the streitnes of thin astrelabie, than is euery smal deuysioun in a
signe departid by two degrees & two; I Mene degrees contenyng 60
Minutes.  & this forseide heuenissh zodiak is cleped the cercle of the
signes  or the cercle of the bestes  for zodia in langage of grek
sownyth `bestes' in latyn tonge.  & in the zodiak ben the 12 signes þat
han names of bestes; or elles for whan the sonne entrith in any of the
signes, he taketh the proprete of swich bestes ; or elles for þat the
sterres that ben there fixed ben disposed in signes of bestes,  or
shape like bestes;  or elles whan the planetes ben vnder thilke signes,
þei causen vs by hir influence operaciouns & effectes lik to the
operaciouns of bestes.  & vnderstonde Also, þat whan an hot planete
comyth into an hot signe, than encresseth his hete; & ȝif a planete be
cold, thanne amenuseth his coldnesse, bycause of the hote signe.  & by
this conclusioun maistow take ensample in alle the signes, be they moist
or drie, or moeble or fix; rekenyng the qualite of the planete as I
furst seide.  & euerich of thise 12 Signes hath respecte to a certein
parcelle of the body of a man and hath it in gouernance; as aries hath
thin heued, & taurus thy nekke & thy throte  gemyni thyn armholes &
thin armes,  & so forth; as shal be shewed more pleyn in the 5 partie
of this tretis. this zodiak, which þat is part of the 8 spere, ouer
kerueth the equinoxial; and he ouerkerueth hym again in euene parties 
& þat on half declinith sowthward, & þat other northward, as pleynli
declareth the tretis of the spere.  & for mor declaracioun, lo here thi
figure.

 Thin almury is cleped the denticle of capricorne or elles the
kalkuler.  this same Almury sit fix in the hed of capricorne, & it

 Rekene and knowe which is the day of thi monthe  & ley thi reule vp
that same day, & thanne wol the verray point of thy rewle sitten in the
bordure, vpon the degree of thy sonne.  Ensample as thus ; the yer of
oure lord 1391, the 12 day of March at Midday, I wolde knowe the degree
of the sonne.  I sowhte in the bakhalf of myn astrelabie, and fond the
sercle of the daies,  the which I knowe by the names of the Monthes
writen vndur the same Cercle.  Tho leide I my rewle ouer this forseide
day, & fond the


      

point of my rewle in the bordure vpon the firste degree of aries, A
litel within the degree  & thus knowe I this conclusioun.  Another
day, I wolde knowe the degree of my sonne, & this was at Midday in the
 day of decembre ; I fond the day of the monthe in maner as I seide 
tho leide I my rewle vpon this forseide  day, & found the point of
my rewle in the bordure vpon the first degree of capricorne  a lite
within the degree  & than haddy of this conclusioun the ful
experience  & for the more declaracioun, lo her thi figure.




         To knowe the altitude of the sonne, or of othre celestial bodies.


        

 Put the ring of thin Astrelabie vpon thi riht thowmbe & turne thi
lift side agayn the light of the sonne And remue thi rewle vp and
down til þat the stremes of the sonne shyne thorgh bothe holes of thi
rewle.  loke thanne how Many degrees thi rewle is areised fro the
litel crois vpon thin est line, & tak ther the altitude of thi sonne. 
& in this same wyse maistow knowe by nyhte the altitude of the Mone, or

nedith no more declaracion; but forget it nat.  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here the figure.




         To knowe euery tyme of the day by liht of the sonne, & euery

        by day the degree of any signe þat assendith on the est
        Orisonte, which þat is cleped communly the assendent or elles
        oruscupum.


      


        

 Tak the altitude of the sonne whan the list, as I haue said ;  & set
the degree of the sonne, in kas þat it be byforn the Middel of the day,
among thin almykanteras on the est side of thin astralabie ; & ȝif it
be after the Middel of the day, set the degree of thy sonne vpon the
west side  tak this manere of settyng for a general rewle, ones for
euere.  & whan thow hast set the degree of thy sonne vp as many
Almykanteras of heyhte as was the altitude of the sonne takyn by thi
rewle,  ley ouer thi label, vpon the degree of the sonne;  & thanne
wol the point of thi label siten in the bordure, vpon the verrey tid
of the day. Ensample as thus  the yer of owre lord 1391, the 12 day of
March, I wold knowe the tyd of the day. I tok the altitude of my sonne,
 & fond þat it was 25 degrees and 30 of Minutes of heyhte in the
bordure on the bakside.  tho turnede I Myn astrelabie, & by cause that
it was byforn̄ Midday, I turnede Mi riet and sette the degree of the
sonne, that is to seyn the .1. degree of Aries  on the riht side of myn
Astralabie, vpon þat 25 degrees & 30 of Minutes of heyhte among myn
almykanteras  tho leide I my label vpon the degree of my sonne, &
fond the poynte  of my label in the bordure, vpon a capital
lettre þat is cleped an X; tho rekened I alle the capitalles lettres fro
the lyne of Midnyght vnto this forseide lettre X, & fond þat it was 9
of the clokke of the day. tho loked I don vpon the Est Orisonte, and
fond there the 20 degree of gemynis assending ;


      

which þat I tok for Myn assendent. & in this wyse hadde I the experience
for euermo in wich maner I sholde knowe the tyde of the day  & ek myn
assendent.  Tho wold I wyte the same nyght folwyng the howr of the
nyght  & wrowhte in this wyse  among an hep of sterris fixe, it liked
me for to take the altitude of the feire white sterre þat is cleped
Alhabor  and fond hir sitting on the west side of the line of Midday,
18 degres of heyhte taken by my rewle on the bakside.  tho sette I the
centre of this Alhabor vpon 18 degrees among myn Almykanteras, vpon
the west side ; by cause þat she was fonden on the west side. tho leide
I my label ouer the degree of the sonne þat was descended vnder the
weste Orisonte,  & rikened alle the lettres capitals fro the lyne of
Midday vnto þe point of my label in the bordure;  & fond þat it was
passed 8 of the clokke the space of 2 degrees  tho loked I doun vpon
myn est orisonte,  & fond ther 23 degrees of libra assending, whom I
tok for myn assendent; & thus lerned I to knowe ones for euer in which
Manere I shuld come to the howre of the nyht  and to myn assendent; as
verreyli as may be taken by so smal  instrument  but natheles in
general wold I warne the for euere  ne mak the neuere bold to haue take
a Iust Ascendent by thin Astrilabie, or elles to haue sette Iustly a
clokke, whan any celestial body by which þat thow wenest gouer e thilke
thynges ben ney the sowth lyne  for trust wel, whan þat þe sonne is ney
the Meridional lyne, the degree of the sonne rennyth so longe consentrik
vpon the almykanteras, þat sothly thow shalt erre fro the Iust
assendent  the same conclusioun sey I by þe centre of any sterre fix by

         Special declaracion of the assendent.


        

 The assendent sothly, as wel in alle natiuitez as in questiouns &
elecciouns of tymes, is a thing which þat thise Astrologiens gretly
obseruen  wherfore me semeth conuenient, sin þat I speke of the
assendent, to make of it special declaracioun  The assendent sothly, to
take it at the , is thilke degree þat assendith at any of
thise forseide tymes vn the est Orisonte; & therefor, yif þat any
planet assende at þat same tyme in thilke forseide  his
longitude, Men seyn þat thilke planete is in horoscopo.  but sothly,
the hows of the assendent, þat is to seyn, the firste hous or the est
Angle, is a thing more brod & large.  For after the statutz of
Astrologiens, what celestial body þat is 5 degres aboue thilk degre þat
assendith, or within þat nowmbre, þat is to seyn, nere the degree þat
assendith  yit rikne thei thilke planet in the Assendent.  And what
planete þat is vnder thilke degree þat assendith the space of 
degrees,  yit sein thei that thilke planete is lyk to him þat is 
the hows of the assendent  but sothly, yif he passe the bondes of thise
forseide spaces, aboue or bynethe, they sein þat the planete is
failling fro the assendent;  yit sein thise Astrologens, that the
assendent  & eke the lord of the assendent, may be shapen for to be
fortunat or infortunat  as thus  a fortunat assendent clepen they whan
þat no wykkid planete, as saturne or Mars, or elles the tail of the
dragoun, is in  hows  of the assendent, ne þat no wikked
planete haue non aspecte of enemyte vpon the assendent ; but they wol
caste þat thei haue a fortunat planete in hir assendent & ȝit in his
felicite,  & than sey they þat it is wel.  fortherouer,


      

they seyn þat the infortunyng of an assendent is the contrarie of this
forseide thinges.  the lord of the assendent sey they þat he is
fortunat, whan he is in god place fro the assendent as in angle; or in a
succedent, whereas he is in his dignite & conforted with frendly
aspectys of planetes &  resceiued, & ek that he may sen the
assendent, and þat he be nat retrograd ne combust, ne ioigned with no
shrewe in the same signe  ne that he be nat in his desencioun, ne
ioigned with no planete in his discencioun, ne haue vpon him non
aspecte infortunat; &  sey they þat he is wel.  natheles, theise
ben obseruauncez of iudicial matiere & rytes of paiens, in which my
spirit ne hath no feith, ne no knowyng of hir horoscopum; for they seyn
þat euery signe is departid in 3 euene parties by  degrees, & thilke
porcioun they clepe a face.  & althogh þat a planete haue a latitude
fro the Ecliptik, yit sey  so þat the planete arise in þat
same signe wyth any degree of the forseide face in which is longitude
is rekned, þat yit is the planete in horoscopo  be it in natiuite or in
eleccioun, &c.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


         To knowe the verrey equacioun of the degree of the sonne, yif

 For as moche as the almykanteras in thin astrelabie ben compownet by
two & two,  whereas some Almykanteras in sondri Astrelabies ben
compownet by on and on, or elles by 2 & 2, it is necessarie to thy
lernyng to teche the first to knowe & worke with thin owne Instrument. 
wherefor, whan þat the degreee of thy sonne falleth bytwixe two
Almykanteras  or elles yif thin Almykanteras ben grauen with ouer gret
a point of a compas  for bothe thise thinges may causen errour as wel
in knowyng of the tid of the day as of the verrey Assendent  thow Most

 Set the degree  thy sonne vpon the heyer Almykanteras of bothe 
& waite wel wher as thin Almury towcheth the bordure, & set ther a

Almykanteras on the west side, & ley thy label on þe degre of thy sonne,
& thanne shal the poynt of thi label schewe the spryng of day.  Also
set the nadir of thy sonne vpon 18 degres of heyhte among thin
Almykanteras on the  side, & ley ouer thy label vpon the degree of
the sonne  & with the point of thy label fynd in the bordure the ende
of the euenyng, þat is, verrey nyht. the nadir of the sonne is thilke

fro that tyme forward  al the nyht til the sonne arise  than shal the
verrey degree of the sonne shewe the howr of the planete. Ensample as
thus.  the xiij. day of March fil vpon a saterday per auenture  & at
the arising of the sonne, I fond the secounde degree of aries sitting
vpon myn est Orisonte, al be it þat it was but lite;  than

         To knowe the altitude of the sonne in Middes of the day,
        that is cleped the altitude Meridian.


        

 Set the degree of the sonne vpon the lyne Meridional, & rikene how
many degrees of Almykanteras ben bytwyxe thyn est Orisonte & the degree
of the sonne.  & tak ther thyn altitude Meridian  this  to seyne,
the heiest of the sonne as for that day.  So maistow knowe in the same
lyne, the heiest cours þat any sterre fix clymbith by nyht ;  this is
to seyn, þat wan any sterre fix is passed the lyne Meridional, than
bygynnyth it to descende, & so doth the sonne.  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


         To knowe the degree of the sonne by thy riet, for a maner
        curiosite, &c.


        

 Sek bysily with thi rewle the heiest of the sonne in Midde of the
day ;  turne thanne thyn Astrelabie, & with a prikke of ynk marke the
nombre of þat same Altitude in the lyne Meridiona turne thanne thy
Ryet abowte til thow fynde a degree of thi zodiak acording with the
prikke,  this is to seyn, sittynge on the prikke ;  & in soth, thow
shalt fynde but 2 degrees in a1 the zodiak of that condicioun;  & yit
thilke 2 degrees ben in diuerse signes;  than maistow lyhtly by the
sesoun of the yere knowe the signe in whiche þat is the sonne. 


      




         To know which day is lik to wych day as of lengthe, &c.


        

 Loke whiche degrees ben illik fer fro the heuedes of Cancer &
Capricorn̛ ; & lok, whan the sonne is in any of thilke degrees, than ben
the dayes ilike of lengthe.  this is to seyn, þat as long is þat day in
þat Monthe, as was swych a day in swich a month  ther variet but
lite.  Also yif þow take 2 daies naturaly in the yer ilike fer fro
eyther pointe of  equinoxial in the opposit parties,  than as long
is the day artificial of þat on day  as is the nyht of þat othere, &
the contrarie.  & for  more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


        This chapitre is a Maner declaracioun to conclusiouns þat folwen.


        

 Vnderstond wel þat thy zodiak is departid in 2 halfe cercles, as fro
the heued of capricorne vnto the heued of Cancer  & agaynward fro the
heued of cancer vnto the heued of Capricorne.  the heued of Capricorne
is the lowest point, wher as the sonne goth in wynter;  & the heued of
Cancer is the heiest point, in whiche the sonne goth in somer.  & ther
for vnderstond wel, þat any two degrees þat ben ilike fer fro any of
thise two heuedes  truste wel þat thilke two degrees ben of ilke
declinacioun, be it sowthward or northward ; & the daies of hem ben
ilike of lengthe, & the


      

nyhtes also ; & the shadwes illke, & the Altitudes ilike at Midday for
euere.  & for more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.




         To knowe the verrey degree of any maner sterre straunge or
        vnstraunge after his longitude, thow he be indeterminat in thin
        astralabie; sothly to the trowthe, thus he shal be knowe.


        

 Tak the altitude of this sterre whan he is on the Est side of the lyne
Meridional, as ney as thow maist gesse ;  & tak an assendent anon riht
by som maner sterre fix which þat þow knowest  & forget nat the
altitude of the firste sterre, ne thyn assendent ; 4 & whan þat this is
don  espie diligently whan this same firste sterre passeth anything
the sowth westward, and hath him anon riht in the same nowmbre of
altitude on the west side of this lyne Meridional  as he was kawht on
the est side ; & tak a newe assendent anon riht by som Maner sterre
fixe which þat thow knowest ; & forget nat this secounde assendent. 
and whan þat this is don, rikne thanne how manye degrees ben bytwixe
the firste assendent & the seconde assendent  & rikne wel the Middel
degree bytwyne bothe Assendentes,


      

& set thilke Middel degree vpon thin est Orisonte ;  & waite thanne
what degre þat sit vpon the line Meridional, & tak ther the verrey
degre of the Ecliptik in which the sterre stondeth for the tyme.  For
in the Ecliptik is the longitude of a celestial body rekened, euene fro
the heued of aries vnto  ende of pisces.  & his latitude is
Rikned after the quantite of is declinacion, north or sowth towarde
þe poles of this world  as thus.  yif it be of the sonne or of any fix
sterre  rekene is latitude or his declinacioun fro thu Equinoxial
cercle;  & yif it be of a planete, rekne than the quantite of is
latitude fro the Ecliptik lyne.  Al be it so þat fro  Equinoxial
may the declinacion or the latitude of any body celestial be rikned,
after the site north or south, & after the quantite of is
declinacion.  & riht so may the latitude or the declinacion of any body
celestial, saue only of the sonne, after his site north or south, &
after the quantite of his declinacioun, be rekned fro the Ecliptik
lyne ;  Fro which lyne alle planetes som tyme declinen north or south,
saue only the forseide sonne.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here
thi figure.


      




         To knowe the degrees of the longitudes of fixe sterres after
        þat they ben determinat in thin astralabie, yif so be þat they
        ben trewly set.


        

 Set the centre of the sterre vpon the lyne Meridional, & tak kep of
thi zodiak,  & loke what degree of any signe þat sit on the same lyne
Meridional at þat same tyme, & tak the degree in which the sterre
standith ;  & with that same degree comth þat same sterre vnto that
same lyne fro the Orisonte.  & for more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


         To knowe with which degree of the zodiak any sterre fixe in
        thin Astrelabie arisith vpon the est Orisonte, Althey is
        dwellyng be in another signe.


        

 Set the Sentre of the sterre vpon the est Orisonte,  & loke what
degre of any signe þat sit vp on the same Orisonte at þat same tyme. 
And vnderstond wel, þat with þat same degre arisith þat same sterre ;
and thys  merueyllous arising with a strange degree in
another signe is bycause þat the latitude of the sterre fix is either
north or sowth fro the equinoxial.  but sothly, the latitudes


      

of planetes ben comuly rekned fro the Ecliptik, bicause þat non of
hem declinet but fewe degrees owt fro the brede of the zodiak.  &
tak god kep of this chapitre of arising of the celestial bodies ; for
truste wel, þat neyther mone ne sterre as in owre Embelif orisonte
arisith with þat same degree of his longitude, saue in O cas;  & that
is, whan they haue no latitude fro the Ecliptik lyne. but natheles som
tyme is eueriche of thes planetes vnder the same lyne.  & for more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


        To knowe the declinacioun of any degree in the zodiak fro the
        equinoxial cercle, &c.


         zodiaco 
        circulo equinoctiali.]

 Set the degree of any signe vpon the lyne Meridional, & rikne is
altitude in Almykanteras fro the Est Orizonte vp to the same degree set
in the forseide lyne, & set ther a prikke.  turne vp thanne thy Riet,
and set the heued of aries or libra in the same Meridional lyne, & set
ther another prikke.  & whan þat this is don, considere the  Altitudes of hem bothe ; for sothly the difference of thilke
altitudes is the declinacion of thilke degre fro the equinoxial.  & yif
so be þat thilke degree be northward fro the equinoxial, than is his
declinacion north ;  yif it be sowthward, than is it sowth.  & for the
more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


      


         To knowe for what latitude in any regioun the Almikanteras
        of any table ben compowned.


        

 Rikne how manie degrees of Almikanteras in the Meridional lyne be fro
the cercle equinoxial vnto the senyth ;  Or elles fro the pool artik
vnto the north Orisonte; & for so gret a latitude or for so smal a
latitude is the table compowned.  & for more declaracion, lo here thi
figure.




         To knowe in special the latitude of owre countray, I mene
        after the latitude of Oxenford, & the heyhte of owre pol.


        

Vnderstond wel, þat as fer is the heued of aries or libra in the
equinoxial from owre orisonte as is the cenyth fro the pole artik ;  &
as hey  the pol Artik fro the Orisonte as the Equinoxial is fer fro
the senyth.  I proue it thus by the latitude of Oxenford  vnderstond
wel, þat the heyhte of owre pool Artik fro owre north Orisonte is 51
degrees & 50 Minutes; than is the cenyth from owre pool Artik 38 degrees
& l0 Minutes; than is the equinoxial from owre senyth 51 degrees & 50
Minutes;  than is owre south Orisonte from owre equinoxial 38 degrees &
l0 Minutes.  vnderstond wel


      

this Reknyng.  Also forget nat þat the cenyth is 90 degrees of heyhte
fro the Orisonte, & owre equinoxial is 90 degrees from owre pool Artik.
 Also this shorte rewle is soth, þat the latitude of any place in a
regioun is the distance fro the senyth vnto the Equinoxial.  & for more
declaracioun, lo here þi figure.


         To proue euidently the latitude of any place in a Regioun,
        by the preue of the heyhte of the pol Artik in þat same place.


        

In some wynters nyht, whan the firmament is clere & thikke sterred 
waite a tyme til þat any sterre fix sit lyneriht perpendiculer ouer
 the pol Artik, & clepe þat sterre A.  & wayte another
sterre þat sit lyneriht vnder A, & vnder the pol  & clepe þat sterre
F. And vnderstond wel, þat F is nat consideret but only  declare þat
A sit euene ouere the pool.  tak thanne anon riht the altitude of A
from the Orisonte  & forget it nat.  Lat A & F go farwel til agayns
the dawenyng a gret while  & come thanne agayn & Abid til þat A is
euene vnder the pol & vnder F ;  for sothly, than wole F sit ouer the
pool  & A wol sit vnder the pool.  tak than eftsones the altitude of
A from the Orisonte  & note as wel is secounde altitude as his
furste Altitude  & whan þat this is don,  rikne how manye degrees þat
the firste altitude of A excedith his seconde altitude,  & tak half
thilke porcioun þat is excedit, & adde it to his seconde altitude ;  &
tak ther the eleuacioun of thi pool, & eke the latitude of thy regioun ;
 for thise two ben of a nombre ;  this is to seyn, as many degrees as
thy pool is eleuat  so michel


      

is the latitude of the Regioun.  Ensample as thus: par auenture the
altitude of A in the euenyng is 56 degrees of heyte than wol his seconde
altitude or the dawyng be 48  þat is  lasse than 56, þat was his
furste altitude at euen.  take thanne the of 8  & adde it to 48, þat
was is seconde altitude, and  hastow   now hastow the
heyhte of thy pol and the latitude of the regioun  but vnderstond wel
þat to proue this conclusioun & many another fair conclusioun, thow
most haue a plomet hanging on a lyne heyer than thin heued on a perche 
& thilke lyne mot hange euene perpendiculer bytwixe the pool & thin
eye  & thanne shaltow sen yif A sitte euene ouer the pool & ouer F at
euene  & also yif F sitte euene ouer the pool & ouer A or day.  & for
more declaracion, lo here thi figure.




         Another conclusioun to proue the heyhte of the pool Artik
        fro the orisonte.


        

Tak any sterre fixe þat neuere dissendith vnder the Orisonte in thilke
regioun, & considere his heiest altitude & his lowest Altitude fro the
Orisonte ;  & make a nombre of bothe thise altitudes ; tak thanne &
abate half þat nombre, & tak þer the eleuacioun of the pol Artik in þat
same Regioun  & for more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


      


         Another conclusioun to proue the latitude of the Regioun, &c.


        

 Vnderstond wel þat the latitude of any place in A Regioun is verreyly
the space bytwixe the senythe of hem þat dwellen there & 
equinoxial cerkle, north or sowthe, takyng the mesure in the Meridional
lyne, as shewith in the Almykanteras of thin Astrelabie.  & thilke
space is as moche as the pool artik is hey in the same place fro the
Orisonte.  And than is the depressioun of the pol antartik, þat is to
seyn, than is the pol antartik bynethe the Orisonte the same quantite
of space, neither mor ne lasse. thanne, yif thow desire to knowe this
latitude of the Regioun, tak the altitude of the sonne in the Middel of
the day, whan the sonne is in the heuedes of aries or of libra  for
thanne Moeuyth the sonne in the lyne equinoxial ;  & abate the nombre
of that same sonnes Altitude owt of 90, & thanne is the remenaunt  of the noumbre þat leuyth the latitude of the Regioun, as thus : I
suppose that the sonne is thilke day at noon 38 degrees And l0 minutes
of heyhte. Abate thanne thees degrees And minutes owt of 90 ; so leueth
there 51 degrees and 50 minutes, the latitude.  I sey nat this but for
ensample ; for wel I wot the latitude of Oxenforde is certein minutes
lasse, as y myght proue.  Now yif so be þat the semith to long a
tarienge, to abide til þat  sonne be in the heuedes of aries or of
libra, thanne whaite whan the sonne is in any other degree of the
zodiak, & considere the degree of is declinacion fro the equinoxial
lyne ;  & yif it so be þat the sonnes declinacion be northward fro the
equinoxial, abate thanne fro the sonnes altitude at noon the nombre


      

of his declinacion,  & thanne hastow the heyhte of the heuedes of aries
& libra ; as thus  My sonne is, par Auenture, in þe firste degre of
leoun, 58 degrees and 10 Minutes of heyhte at noon  & his declinacion
is almost 20 degrees northward fro the equinoxial ; abate thanne thilke
20 degrees of declinacion owt of the altitude at noon, than leueth the
38 degrees and odde Minutes ; lo ther the heued of aries or libra, &
thin equinoxial in that Regioun.  Also yif so be þat the sonnes
declinacioun be sowthward fro the Equinoxial,  Adde thanne thilke
declinacion to the altitude of the sonne at noon  and tak ther the
heuedes of aries & libra & thin Equinoxial.  abate thanne the heyhte of
the Equinoxial owt of 90 degrees, & thanne leuyth there þe distans of
the pole, 51 degrees & 50 Minutes, of that regioun fro the Equinoxial. 
Or elles yif the lest, take the haiest altitude fro the equinoxial of
any sterre fix that thow knowest, & tak his nethere elongacioun
lengthing fro the same equinoxial lyne, & wirke in the maner forseid. 
& for more declaracion, lo here thi figure.




         Declaracioun of the assensioun of signes, &c.


        

The excellence of the spere solide, amonges other noble conclusiouns,
shewyth Manifeste the diuerse assenciouns of signes in diuerse places,
as wel in the rihte cercle as in the Embelif cercle.  thise Auctours
writen þat thilke signe is clept of riht Ascensioun, with which more
part of the cercle Equinoxial & lasse part of the zodiak ascendith  &
thilke signe assendith Embelif, with whiche lasse part of the Equinoxial
and more part of the zodiak assendith.


      

  & euere mo the Arch of the day & the arch of
the nyht is ther ylike long, & the sonne twyes euery yer passinge thorow
the cenyth of her heued; & 2 someres & 2 wynteres in a yer han this
forseide poeple.  And the Almykanteras in her Astrolabies ben streyhte
as a lyne  so as shewyth in this figure.  The vtilite to knowe the
Assenciouns in the rihte cercle is this  truste wel þat by mediacioun
of thilke assenciouns thise Astrologiens by hir tables &


      

hir instrumentz knowen verreyly the Assencioun of euery degree & Mynut
in al the zodiak, as shal be shewyd.  And nota, þat this forseid rihte
orisonte, þat is clepid orison rectum  diuideth the equinoxial into
riht Angles ; & the embelif orisonte, wher as the pol is enhawsed vpon
the orisonte, ouerkeruyth the equinoxial in Embelif Angles, as shewith
in the figure.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


        This is the conclusioun to knowe the Assenciouns of signes in
        the riht cercle, þat is, circulus directus, &c.


        



Set the heued of what signe the liste to knowe his Assending in the riht
cercle  vpon  lyne Meridional,  & waite wher thin Almury
towchiet the bordure, & set ther a prikke turne thanne thy riet
westward til þat the ende of the forseide signe sitte vpon the
Meridional lyne  & eftsones waite wher thin almury towchith the
bordure, & set ther Another prikke. Rikne thanne the nombre of degrees
in the bordure bytwyxe bothe prikkes,  & tak the Assencioun of the
signe in the riht cercle. And thus maistow wyrke with euery porcioun of
thy zodiak, &c.  & for the more declaracioun, lo her thi figure.


        To knowe the assencions of signes in the Embelif cercle in
        euery regioun, I Mene, in circulo obliquo.


        

 Set the heued of the signe which as the list to knowe his Ascensioun


      

vpon the est Orisonte,  & waite wher thyn Almury towchith the bordure,
&  ther a prikke.  turne thanne thy riet vpward til þat the ende
of the same signe sitte vpon the Est Orisonte  and waite eftsones
wher as thin almury towcheth the bordure, & set ther another prikke. 
Rikne thanne the nowmbre of degrees in the bordure bytwyxe bothe
prikkes, & tak ther the Assencioun of the signe in the Embelif cercle. 
& vnderstond wel, þat alle signes in thy zodiak fro the heued of aries
vnto the ende of virgo ben cleped signes of the north fro the
Equinoxal,  & the signes arisen bytwyxe the verrey est & the
verrey north in owre Orisonte generaly for euere ; & alle signes fro the
heued of libra vnto þe ende of pisces ben cleped signes of the sowth
fro  the Equinoxial ;  & thise signes arisen euermo bytwyxe
the verrey est & the verrey sowth in owre orisonte.  Also euery signe
bytwixe the heued of capricorne vnto the ende of geminis ariseth on
owre Orisonte in lasse than 2 howres equales;  & thise same signes, fro
the heued of capricorne vnto the ende of geminis, ben cleped tortuos
signes or kroked signes  for they arisen embelif on oure Orisonte;  &
thise crokede signes ben obedient to the signes þat ben of riht
Assencioun.  The signes of riht assencioun ben fro the heued of cancer
to þe  of sagittare;  & thise signes arisen more vpriht, & they
ben called eke souereyn signes ;  & euerich of hem ariseth in mor space
than in to howres.  Of which


      

signes gemini obeieth to Cancer,  & taurus to leo  Aries to virgo 
pisces to libra,  Aquarius to Scorpioun, and Capricorne to Sagittare. 
& thus euermo 2 signes that ben illike fer fro the heued of capricorne 
obeien euerich of hem til other.  & for more declaracioun, lo here the

 Take the altitude of thy sonne whan the list  & note wel the quarter
of the world in which the sonne is for the tyme by the Azymutz.  turne
thanne thin Astrolabie  & set the degree of the sonne in the
Almykanteras of his altitude on thilke side þat the sonne stant  as is
the manere in takyng of howres ;  & ley thy label on the degree of the
sonne, And rikene how many degres of the bordure ben bytwixe the lyne

Rewle ther thow takest thyne Altitudes  vpon as many degrees in his
bordure fro his Meridional as was the point of thy label fro the lyne
Meridional on the wombeside.  tak thanne thyn Astrolabie with bothe

more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


         To knowe the Altitude of planetes fro the wey of the sonne,
        whether so they be north or sowth fro the forseide wey.


        

 Lok whan þat a planete is in the lyne Meridional, yif þat hir altitude
be of the same heyhte þat is the degree of the sonne for þat day, & than
is the planete in the verrey wey of the sonne,  & hath no latitude.  &
yif the altitude of the planete be heyere than the degree of the sonne,
þan is the planete north fro the wey of the sonne swych a quantite of
latitude as  by thyn Almykanteras. & ȝif the altitude of the
planete be lasse than the degree of the sonne  thanne  is the
planete sowth fro the wey of the sonne swich a quantite of latitude as

the sonne wente thilke day  but nat from the wey of the sonne in euery
place of the zodiak.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


         To knowe the senyth of the arysing of the sonne, this is to
        seyn, the partie of the Orisonte in which þat the sonne arisith.


        

 Thow most first considere þat the sonne ariseth nat alwey verrey est,
but some tyme by north the est, and som tyme by sowthe


      

the est  Sothly the sonne ariseth neuermo verrey est in owere
Orisonte,  but he be in the heued of aries or libra. now is thin
Orisonte departed in 24 parties by thi azymutz, in significacion of 24
partiez of the world; al be it so þat shipmen rikne thilke partiez in
32  thanne is ther no more but waite in which azymut þat thi sonne
entreth at is arisyng  & take ther the senyth of the arising of the
sonne.  the manere of the deuisioun of thin Astralabie is this  I Mene
as in this cas.  First is it deuided in 4 plages principalx with the
lyne þat goth from est to west,  & than with another lyne þat goth fro
soth to north.  than is it deuided in smale partiez of Azymutz, as
est, and est by sowthe, whereas is the firste Azimut aboue the est

         To knowe in which partie of the firmament is the coniunccioun.


        

 Considere the tyme of the coniunccon by thy kalender  as thus ;
lok how many howres thilke coniunccion is fro the Midday of


      

the day precedent, as shewith by the canoun of thi kalender;  rikne
thanne thilke nombre of howres in the bordure of thyn Astralabie  as
thow art wont to do in knowyng of the howres of the day or of the nyht;
 & ley thy label ouer the degree of the sonne;  & thanne wol the point
of thy label sitte vpon the hour of the con iunccion.  loke thanne in
which Azymut the degree of thy sonne sittith, & in that partie of the
firmament is the coniunccioun.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here
thy figure.




         To knowe the senyth of the Altitude of the sonne, &c.


        

This is no mor to seyn but any tyme of the day tak the altitude of the
sonne, & by the Azymut in which he stondith,  Maistou sen in which
partie of the firmament he is  &  the same wyse maistou sen, by the
nyht, of any sterre, wheither the sterre sitte est or west or north, or
any partie bytwene, aftur the name of the Azimut in which is the
sterre.  & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


         To knowe sothly the degree of the longitude of the mone, or
        of any planete þat hath no latitude for the tyme fro the
        Ecliptik lyne.


      


        

 Tak the altitude of the mone, & rikne thin altitude vp among thyne
Almykanteras on which side that the Mone stande, & set there a prikke. 
Tak thenne anon riht, vpon the mones side, the Altitude of any sterre
fix which þat thow knowest, & set his Centre vpon his altitude Among
thin Almykanteras ther the sterre is fownde.  Waite thanne which degree
of the zodiak  the prikke of the altitude of the mone, & tak
ther the degree in which the mone standith.  this conclusioun is verrey
soth, yif the sterres in thin Astrolabie stonden aftur  the
trowthe ; of comune, tretis of Astralabie ne make non excepcioun
wheyth the mone haue latitude, or non  ne on wheither side of the
mone the Altitude of the sterre fix be taken.  And nota, þat yif the
Mone  himself by liht of day, than maistow wyrke this same
conclusioun by the sonne, as wel as by the fix sterre.  & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thy figure.


         This is the workinge of the conclusioun, to knowe yif þat
        any planete be directe or retrograde.


        

 Tak the altitude of any sterre þat is cleped a planete,  & note it
wel.  & tak ek anon the altitude of any sterre fix that thow


      

knowest, & note it wel also.  Come thanne agayn the thridde or the
ferthe nyht next folwyng ; for thanne shaltow aperceyue wel the Moeuyng

        To knowe with which degree of the zodiak þat any planete
        Assendith on the Orisonte, wheyther so that his latitude be
        north or sowth.

 Knowe be thin almenak the degree of the Ecliptik of any signe in which
þat the planete is rekned for to be  & that is cleped the degree of his
longitude; & knowe Also the degree of his latitude fro the Ecliptik,
north or sowth.  And by this samples folwynge in special  maistow
wyrke for  in euery signe of the zodiak. the degree of
 par auenture, of venus or of another planete was 6 of
Capricorne, & the latitude of him was northward 2 degrees fro the
Ecliptik lyne. I tok a subtil compas, & cleped þat on poynt of my compas
A, & þat other poynt F.  Than  I the point of A, & set it in 
Ecliptik line euene in my zodiak, in the degree of the longitude of
venus  þat is to seyn, in the 6 degree of Capricorne  & thanne set I
the point of F vpward in the same  signe, bycause þat the
latitude was north, vpon the latitude of venus, that is to seyn, in the
6 degree fro the heued of capricorne; & thus hauy 2 degrees bytwixe my
to prikkes; than leide I down softely my compas,  & sette the degree of
the longitude vpon the Orisonte  tho tok I & wexede my label in Maner
of a peyre tables to resceyue distynctly the prikkes of my compas.  Tho
tok I this forseide label, & leide it fix ouer the degree of my
longitude  tho tok I vp my compas,  & sette the point of A in the wex
on my label, as euene as y kowde gesse ouer the Ecliptik lyne, in the
ende of  longitude  & sette the point of F endlang in my label vp
on the space of the latitude, inwarde & ouer the zodiak, that


      

is to seyn, northward fro the Ecliptik  than leide I down my compas &
lokede wel in the wey vpon the prikke of A & of F; tho turned I my Riet
til þat the prikke of F sat vpon the Orisonte  than saw I wel þat the
body of venus, in hir latitude of  degrees septentrionalis, assendid,
in the ende of the 6 degree, in the heued of capricorne.  And nota, þat
in the same maner maistow wyrke with any latitude septentrional  signes ; but sothly the latitude Meridional of a planete in
Capricorne may not be take, by cause of the litel space bytwixe the
Ecliptik  & the bordure of the Astrelabie; but sothly, in alle other
 it May.



 Also the degree, par auenture, of Iuppiter or of another planete, was
in the furst degree of pisces in longitude  & his latitude was 3
degrees Meridional; tho tok I the point of A  & set it in the firste
degree of pisces on the Ecliptik  & thanne set I the point of F
downward in the same signe, by cause þat the latitude was sowth 3
degrees  þat is to seyn̄, fro the heued of pisces  & thus hauy 3
degrees bytwixe bothe prikkes ; thanne sette I the degree of the
longitude vpon the Orisonte; tho tok I my label  & leide it fix vpon
the degree of the longitude; tho sette I the point of A on my label,
euene ouer the Ecliptik lyne in the ende euene of the degree of the
longitude  & set the point of  in my label the space  3
 of the latitude fro the zodiak, this is to seyn, sowthward fro
the Ecliptik, toward the bordure; and turned my


      

Riet  the prikke of F sat vpon the Orisonte; thanne  I wel
þat the body of Iuppiter, in his latitude of 3 degrees Meridional,
ascendit with 14 degrees of pisces in horoscopo  & in this Maner
maistow wyrke with any latitude Meridional, as I first seide, saue in
Capricorne  And yif thow wolt pleie this craft with the arisyng of the
Mone, loke thow rekne wel her cours howre by howre; for she ne dwellith
