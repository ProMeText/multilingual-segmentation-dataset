LIFE OF ALEXANDER


 How Anectanabus fled Egypt to Macedonia

The most learned Egyptians who know the size of the earth, the waves of
the sea, and the order of the heavens (betokening the way of the stars
and the turning of the skies), have bequeathed these things to the whole
world through the highness and the wisdom of magic knowledge. And they
tell of a king of that land, by name Anectanabus, great in
understanding, and full of love in astrology and mathematics. Now, upon
a day it happened that a messenger came, and said unto him that
Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, was drawing nigh towards him with a
very great force of foes. Yet he did not call out his army, nor get
ready his advance. Instead of this, he hurried into his bedchambers in
his palace, and, taking down a brazen shell, which was full of rainwater, and holding in his hand a brazen rod, sought by magic spells to
summon the devils. By which wizardry he felt, in the shell itself, the
fleets sailing over him amid fearful affray.

Now there were lords of Anectanabus set in sway over his armies to guard
the Persian border.

And one hapless man coming to him, besought him: 'O most mighty King
Anectanabus, there ariseth against thee Artaxerxes, the king of the
Persians, with an untold horde of foes and strange races. For they are
Parthians, Medes, Persians, Syrians, Mesopotamians, Brapes, Phares,
Argiri, Chaldaeans, Bachiri, Confires, Hircanians, and Agiophii, and
many other folks coming from Eastern lands.' On hearing this,
Anectanabus said, sighing: 'The trust that I gave to thee, heed thou
right well; yet thy prowess hath not been the prowess of a doughty man,
but the doings of a cowardly fellow. For worth showeth itself, not in
the greatness of the folk, but in the steadfastness of their souls. Dost
thou not know one lion putteth many




 

does to flight?' And having said these words, he went into his chamber
alone, and made brazen shells, and filled them with rainwater, and held
in his hand a palm rod, and gazing into this, began, as hard as he
could, to utter spells, and beheld how the Egyptians were being smitten
down at the onslaught of the Barbarians' ships.

Forthwith he changed his dress, and shaved his head and beard, and took
gold as much as he might bear, and which might be needful to him to busy
himself with wizardry. And thus he fled from Egypt, near by Pelusium.
And at length, coming into Ethiopia, he put on linen apparel, in
the guise of an Egyptian seer went into Macedonia. And there he sate
himself, and before all the Greeks, and in their sight was soothsaying.
But the Egyptians, when they saw how Anectanabus was not at Court, went
to Serapis, who was their greatest god, and besought him that he might
give them answer as to Anectanabus their king. And Serapis replied:
'Anectanabus, your king, is gone from Egypt because of Artaxerxes, the
king of the Persians, who will subdue you unto his lordship.
Nevertheless, when a short time hath flown by, he will come back to
shake off his thraldom, and will be avenged on your foes, and yoke them
under you.' And as soon as they had got this answer, they made a kingly
statue out of a black stone, in honour of Anectanabus. And they wrote on
it, at his feet, this saying, that it might be handed down for their
offspring to think of. But Anectanabus remained in Macedonia, nor was he
known.




 How Anectanabus went up to the Palace to Olympia the Queen.

In the meantime, Philip, king of Macedonia, went out to battle. But
Anectanabus went forward to the palace, that he might behold Olympia the
queen, and see how fair she was. And when he saw her, his heart was
smitten with love of her, and stretching forth his hand, he greeted her,
saying, 'Hail, Queen of Macedonia,' disdaining to call her 'lady'. And
she, Olympia, answered him, speaking thus: 'Hail, master, come thou and
sit near.' And when he sate thus, Olympia




 

asked many things of him. 'Art thou not an Egyptian?' And Anectanabus
answered: 'The word thou saidst was kingly, when thou didst name the
Egyptians. For the Egyptians are wise, and read dreams, understand the
birds of the air in their flight, open up the hidden places, and tell
the fate of those newborn, babes. Of all these things, as a seer, I,
too, have knowledge.' And Olympia saw how he gazed upon her, and spoke,
'Master, of what dost thou bethink thee, who thus lookest on me?' And
Anectanabus answered, 'I call to my mind many answers of the gods. One
answer had been that I was to look upon a queen.' And saying this, he
drew forth from his breast a cleansing tablet of bronze and ivory,
inwrought with gold and silver, and on its face were three whirls. The
first contained in itself the Twelve Minds, and in the third, sun and
moon were fashioned. Next to them, was seen a chain of ivory, and from
it he pulled forth sever wonderbright stars, that told the hours and
birthdooms of men, and seven carven stones, and two stones for the
saving men whole.

And Olympia beheld these things, and said: 'Master, if thou wouldst I
should believe thee, tell me the year, the day and hour of the king's
birth.' And upon this, he said to the queen, 'Wishest thou to hear
nothing else from me?' Quoth the queen, 'Tell me what shall fall out
betwixt Philip and me, for men say that, when Philip shall come from the
war, he will thrust me forth, and take another mate.' And Anectanabus
answered: 'They prate of many things untruly; but ere a long time pass,
it shall be as they say.' And the queen answered: 'I beg thee, master,
unveil me all the truth.' Thereupon Anectanabus:ï¿½'One of the mightiest
gods shall share thy bed and uphold thee through all thy thrivings and
downfalls, even if they be overstrong.' Olympia replied: 'I beseech
thee, say what shape this god shall put on?' Anectanabus replied:
'Neither young, nor old; his beard besprinkled with white hairs.
Wherefore, if this please thee, be ready for him, for at night shalt
thou see him, and in thy sleep shall he lie by thee.' The queen said:
'If I behold this, neither as a seer, nor as godly, but, as the god
himself, will I worship' . And at once Anectanabus said, 'Fare
thee well, O queen.' After this Anectanabus, leaving the palace, and
walking straight forth




 

to the city's camp in a desert spot, tore up herbs, and ground them, and
took their juice, and wrought spells and other like things of the fiend,
that in that same night Olympia might behold the god Hamon lying beside
her, and saying to her thereafter, 'Woman, thou hast conceived him who
shall beshield thee.' And, on the morrow, Olympia awoke from her
slumbers, and called Anectanabus to her, and told him of the dream she
had beheld. Then Anectanabus said: 'If thou wilt give me room in the
palace, thou shalt see the god himself, face to face. For that god shall
come to thee in the shape of a great snake, and soon after, taking on a
manlike body, he shall seem to be in my likeness.' And to this Olympia
said: 'As thou hast spoken, master, do. Take to thyself a bed in the
palace, and canst thou make good the truth thereof, I will deem thee to
be the father of the boy.' And, about the first watch of the night,
Anectanabus took on him, through spells and wizardry to be changed into
the shape of a great snake, and whistling on to the bedchamber of
Olympia, to fly through. And he entered her room, and rose on to her
bed, and with great love began to kiss her, and the kisses betokened to
her who he was. And when he rose up from the bed, he smote her on the
womb, and spake: 'This begetting be thy avenging, and in no wise may it
be upbraided of men.'

On such a fashion was Olympia cheated, who had lain with a man as though
he had been a god. And in the morning, Anectanabus went down from the
palace, and the queen was with child.

And when she began to be big, she called unto her Anectanabus, saying:
'Master, tell me, what doom will Philip wreak on me, when he shall come
back?' And Anectanabus said to her, 'Be not afraid: god Hamon will
champion thee.' And with these words he left the palace, and went
outside the town, to a barren spot. And, uprooting grasses, rubbed them,
and grated them, and took their sap. And he caught a seabird, and began
to sing over the herbs, and anoint the herbs with the sap. This he did
in fellowship with the fiends, that he might betray King Philip through
a dream. And this was brought about. That same night the god Hamon
appeared to Philip, in a dream, lying with his wife Olympia, and, the
night ended, he




 

saw him touch her womb, and seal it with a golden ring. And on the ring
there was a stone, and graven on this a lion's head, and the chariot of
the sun, and a very sharp sword. And he said to her: 'Woman, thou hast
conceived thy saviour.' And Philip awoke from his sleep, and calling
Arideus, made known to him the dream, and what he had seen. And Arideus
said: 'Philip, not from man, but from a god, hath thy wife conceived. In
truth, the lion's head and the chariot of the sun and the sharp sword,
foretoken that he, who shall be born of her, shall journey to the East
whence riseth the sun! And with the sharp sword shall he underyoke to
himself the nations of the whole world.'




 How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Mighty Dragon went to the fore
 in front of Philip and overcame his Enemies in the Fray.

In the meanwhile, King Philip fought and won. For there appeared in the
battle a dragon, who went before him and laid low his foes. And when he
came back to Macedonia, he met and kissed Olympia. And King Philip gazed
upon her, and said, 'To whom, O Olympia, hast thou given thyself up. For
sinned thou hast, yet not sinned, for as much as thou hast brooked
frowardness from a god. But I have seen all that has been done by a god
on thee, in a dream: therefore be blameless in my eyes, and the eyes of
all men!' 


 How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Dragon came before Philip at a
 Festival and kissed Olympia.

On a certain day Philip was feasting with his lords and chieftains of
Macedonia and with Olympia his wife. And Anectanabus through wizardry
took on himself the shape of a dragon, and, passing through the midst of
the couch whereon they lay apart, whistled so loudly that all the
revellers were stricken with fear, and the greatest dread, and coming
near Olympia, he put his head on her breast and kissed her. Philip,
seeing this, spoke to Olympia, 'Woman, thee and all I tell; beheld this
dragon, what time I laid my enemies low.' 


 


 How a Bird laid an Egg in Philip's Bosom at whose breaking there
 came forth a Serpent, which forthwith died.

And a few days after this Philip the king was sitting in his palace, and
there appeared unto him a little and most gentle bird, which flew into
his bosom and laid an egg. And the egg, falling to the ground, was
broken. And at once there crept forth from it a very little snake. And
it turned around, wishful to go into the egg, but, before it might put
in its head, it was quenched. And Philip, seeing this, was heavily
distressed, and called to him Arideus, and showed him the monstrous
thing he had seen. And Arideus said to him, 'King Philip, a son shall be
born to thee, who shall reign after thy death, and shall fare forth over
the whole world and sway all peoples, and ere he come back to the land
of his birth, shall die by a most swift death.'

And as the time of childbirth was drawing nigh, Olympia began to feel
pain, and her womb was tormented, and she bade Arideus be called to her,
and spoke with him: 'Master, my womb is wrenched with very heavy
labours.' Anectanabus then spake:
'Raise thyself awhile from thy throne, for in this hour the elements are
troubled by the sun.' This was done, and the pain went from her. And
soon after, Anectanabus said to her, 'Sit down, O Queen!' and she sate
herself and bore a child. And as soon as the boy was fallen on to the
earth, a mighty thunderclap and thunderbolts, with tokens and lightnings
came about throughout the whole world. Then night was spread forth and
lasted, it reaching unto the last hour of day. Then parts of the clouds
fell down in Italy. And seeing these signs, Philip the king was
afrighted, and went in to Olympia, and said: 'I deemed that this little
babe should in no wise be fostered. For he is not conceived of me, but
of some god, for at his birth I beheld the heavens changed. Yet let him
be fostered in my memory, as though he were my son, and follow in the
stead of a son I begot through another wife.' And when he said this, she
handled the babe with great care. And the boy's face had the likeness
neither of father nor mother. The hair on his head




 

was shaggy as a lion's. His eyes glistened like the stars, but each
beamed with its own hue, one black, the other yellow. And his teeth were
sharp, and his eager rush as a lion's. His shape foreshadowed his energy
and forethought. By his parents he was called Alexander. In the schools,
and wheresoever he sate, he strove with them in letters and
disputations, and by his keen swiftness won the mastership. And when he
was twelve years old, he was beweaponed for battle, and excelled in
arms. And Philip, seeing how quick he was, praised him, and said: 'Son
Alexander, I love thy speed, and wit of mind for its work. But I am sore
and feel foolish that thy form is no unlike mine.' And Olympia heard
this, and was greatly afraid. And she called hither Anectanabus, and
said: 'Master, learn from me what Philip misdeemeth. For he said to
Alexander, "Son, I love thy speed and wit of mind. But, that thy shape
is unlike mine, I am saddened."' And Anectanabus began to think, and
said: 'His thought is nowise harmful.' And gazing aloft as he was wont,
he looked on a certain star, and riddled out his wish. And when
Alexander heard this, he spake: 'The star thou seest is seen in the
heavens?' And Anectanabus replied: 'My son, it is.' Alexander said:
'Canst thou show it unto me?' Anectanabus answered: 'Follow me in the
hour of night, and I will show it unto thee.' Alexander said: 'Thy fate
is not known to thee, or uncertain?' Anectanabus replied: 'Enough of
this.' Alexander said: 'I would fain know it.' Anectanabus answered: 'In
truth know that from my son shall come my death.' This said, as he went
down from the palace, Alexander followed him in the hour of the evening
without the city. And when they arrived up on to the ditch of the city,
Anectanabus spake: 'Son Alexander, gaze thou on the stars; look how the
star of Hercules is perplexed, and how Mercury's star is blithe. If I
see Jove sparkling, my doom telleth me of my coming death at the hands
of my son.' At this sight Alexander came up nigh to him, and made an
onslaught on him, making him fall

 downÌ in to Ã¾e dyke, and
thare he feÆÆe, & was aÆÆ tofruschedÌ; and Ã¾anÌ Alexander saidÌ vnto hym
one this wyse. 'Fals


 

wreche,' quoÃ¾ he, 'that presumeÈ to teÆÆ thyngeÈ Ã¾at ere to comÌ, reÈte
als Ã¾ou were a prophete, and knewe Ã¾e preuateÈ of heuenÌ. Now may Ã¾ou see
that Ã¾ou lyeÈ, And Ã¾arefore Ã¾ou arte worthy to hafe swilke a dede.' And
thanÌ Anectanabus ansuerdÌ, & saidÌ: 'I wyste wele ynoghe,' quoÃ¾ he, 'Ã¾at I
scholde die swylke a dede. Talde I noÈte lange are to Ã¾e, that mynÌ awennÌ
sonÌ schulde slae me ?' 'Whi, ame I thi sonÌ ?' Ã¾anÌ quoÃ¾ Alexandire: 'Èaa,
for sothe,' quoÃ¾ Anectanabus, ' I gat the.' And wit Ã¾at wordÌ, he Èalde
Ã¾e gaste. And thanÌ Alexander hert tendirdÌ onÌ his Fader, And he tuke hym
vp on his bakke, and bare hym to Ã¾e palace. And whenÌ his moder Olympias
saw hym, Scho saidÌ vntiÆÆ hym. 'SonÌ,' quoÃ¾ scho, 'what es that?' 'Als
thi foly hase made it,' quoÃ¾ he, 'so it es.' And thanÌ he gert berye hym
wirchipfully.

In the mene tyme, a prynce of Macedoyne broghte Ã¾e kyng a horse vntemedÌ, a grete and a faire; & he was tyedÌ onÌ ilke side wit chynes of
IrenÌ, for he walde wery menÌ and ete Ã¾amÌ. This ilke horse was calledÌ
Buktiphalas, bicause of his vgly lukynge, For he hade a heuedÌ lyke a
buÆÆe, & knottiÆÆs in his frount, as Ã¾ay had hene Ã¾e bygynnyng of
hournes. And whenÌ Ã¾e kyng saw Ã¾e bewtee of this horse, he said tiÆÆ his
seruandis, 'TakeÈ this horse and putteÈ hym in a stable, and makes
barreÈ of yrenÌ before hym, that thefeÈ and oÃ¾er mysdoers, Ã¾at saÆÆ be
done to dede, may be putt intiÆÆ hym, to be slaenÌ of hym. And Ã¾ay diddÌ
soo. In Ã¾e mene tyme Ã¾e kynge Philippe hadÌ ane answere of his goddes,
that hee schulde regne nexte after hym, the whilke myghte ryde that
wylde horse witowttenÌ harme. So it feÆÆe Ã¾at Alexander Ã¾e whilke was
Ã¾anÌ twelue Èere alde, wexe strange & reÈte hardy, & was wysse and
discrete; for he was wele leredÌ & connandÌ in aÆÆ Ã¾e seuenÌ sciences, Ã¾e
whilke twa philosophirs had techedÌ hym : Ã¾at es to say, Arestotle &
Calistene. And one a day, as Alexander passedÌ forby Ã¾e place Ã¾are als
Ã¾e foresaide stode, he luked in betwene Ã¾e barreÈ of yrnne and saw,
bifore Ã¾e horse, mens hendÌ and fete, & oÃ¾er of Ã¾aire membris, liggandÌ

nekke, als ferre als he myghte, and likkedÌ Alexander handÌ; and he knelidÌ
dounÌ onÌ his kneesse, and bihelde Alexander in Ã¾e vesage langly. And
Alexander vnderstode wele Ã¾e wiÆÆ of Ã¾e horse, and opyndÌ the barreÈ, and
went into Ã¾e horse, and strakedÌ him softely on Ã¾e bakke wit his riÈte
handÌ; And belyfe Ã¾e horse wexe wonderly meke tiÆÆ Alexander; and riÈte
as a honde wiÆÆ couche whenÌ his maister biddes hym, so dide he tiÆÆ
Alexander; and Alexander lukede besides hym, & sawe a sadiÆÆ & a brydeÆÆ
hyng thare; and he tuke & dydÌÃ¾amÌ onÌ hymÌ, & leppe one his bakke & rade
furthe onÌ hym. And whenÌ the kynge Philippe sawe hym do so, he saidÌ vntiÆÆ hym 'Mi sonÌ Alexander' quoÃ¾ he: 'AÆÆ Ã¾e ansuers of our goddeÈ are
fulfillede in the! For whenÌ I ame dede, Ã¾ou monÌ regne after me' And
Alexander ansuerd; & saidÌ 'I pray the, Fader,' quoÃ¾ he, 'ordeyne me
horse & menÌ, for I gaa seke dedeÈ of armeÈ.' 'For sothe' quoÃ¾ Ã¾e kynge
wit a glade chere, 'Take Ã¾e a hundreth horse, and xl thosandeÈ pounde of
golde; and take wit the of Ã¾e worthieste knyghteÈ Ã¾at langeÈ to me, and

And he tuke wit hym also a philosopâre Ã¾at highte Eufestius, whilke he
traystedÌ mekiÆÆ in, And twelue childre Ã¾at he chese to be his playfers,
and went hym furthe, and come intiÆÆ a contreth Ã¾at es called Polipone.
And whenÌ the kynge of Ã¾e landÌ herdÌ teÆÆ, Ã¾at swilke menÌ ware entredÌ into his rewme in swilke araye, he raysedÌ a gret Oste, and come agaynes

'I am Alexander' quoÃ¾ he 'Ã¾e sonÌ of Philippe, Ã¾e kynge of Macedoyne.'
'And what hopeÈ Ã¾ou Ã¾at I be ?' quoÃ¾ Ã¾e kynge tiÆÆ hym. And Alexander

spitte at Alexander, & saidÌ: 'Take Ã¾e Ã¾are, Ã¾ou biche whelpe, Ã¾at Ã¾e

And agaynes Ã¾e day of BateÆÆe, Alexander, bi ascent & ordynance of kynge
Philippe, gadird a grete Oste, & went to the place Ã¾are Ã¾e BateÆÆe was
assigned, and fand aÆÆ redy Ã¾are, kyng NicoÆÆ and his oste. And Ã¾ay

And sythenÌ he went hame tiÆÆ his fader, kyng Philippe, and fandÌ hym
sittandÌ at the mete at a bridale: For he had put awaye fra hym his wyfe
Olympias, Alexander moder, and takenÌ hym anoÃ¾er Ã¾at highte Cleopatra;
And Alexander went into Ã¾e hauÆÆe, and said vnto Ã¾e kynge PhilippÌ:
'Fader,' quoÃ¾ he, 'I pray Èow, Ã¾at for a rewarde of my firste iournee
Ã¾at I hafe now made, Èee graunte me to take my Moder Olympias agayne vnto Èow, & do to hir as awe to be done to a qwenne, rathere Ã¾anÌ I gyffe

littiÆÆ afterwardeÈ, Alexander went tiÆÆ hym for to vesett hym &
comforthe hym, and saidÌ vntiÆÆ hym 'Philippe,' quoÃ¾ he, 'if aÆÆ it be

Alexander went tiÆÆ his Moder Olympyas, and saidÌ vntiÆÆ hir: 'Be noÈte

whenÌ be hade sayde thus, he leddÌ hir furthe to Ã¾e kyng Philippe. And he
tuk & kyssid hir, and thus was scho reconnselde vntiÆÆ hym agayne.

After Ã¾is, Ã¾are come messengers Fra Darius, Ã¾e emperour of Perse, to
kyng Philippe, and askedÌ hym tribute And Alexander answerdÌ to thir
messengers, & saide, 'Saise to Darius, Èour lorde,' quoÃ¾ he, 'Ã¾at senÌ Ã¾e

An in Ã¾e mene tyme, whils he was Ã¾are, a lorde of Macedoyne Ã¾e whilke

And alsone the worde come to Pansamy Ã¾at Alexander was comenÌ, and he

When kyng Philippe was entered, Alexander went and sett hym in his

And whenÌ Ã¾e lordes and knyghtis Ã¾at ware of grete age, herdÌ thir wordes

alowedÌ his hie witte and hally Ã¾ay assentede to hym for to do his lyste.

Sone after Alexander assemblede a grete Oste, & went bi Schippe towardeÈ Ytaly, and als he come by Calcedoyne, he assaylledÌ it reÈte
strangly, and Ã¾e folke of Calcedoyne went to Ã¾e walles of Ã¾e

fra thethynÌ he Schippede intiÆÆ Italy. And alsone als Ã¾e Romaynes herdÌ

Fra thethyn he Schippede intiÆÆ Affrice, in thee whilke he fande bot

sodeynly he conqueridÌ it & broghte it vnder his subieccionÌ. And fra
Affric he went by Schippe tiÆÆ ane Ile, Ã¾at es calledÌ Frontides, for to

temple, & made sacrafyce of Ã¾is hert vnto goddÌ Amon, and bysoughte hym
Ã¾at he schulde gyffe hym ansuares. WhenÌ Alexander hade made his prayers
Ã¾are to goddÌ AmonÌ, he went wit his Oste intiÆÆ a place Ã¾at highte
Taphoresey, In Ã¾e whilke were feftene gude townues, & Ã¾ay bade twelne

prophycye hym what kyns dede he scholde die. Serapis ansuerd and said,
'It es noghte spedfuÆÆ tiÆÆ a man to knawe his paynefuÆÆ endynge. For if

Cite of AskalonÌ and bad Ã¾aimÌ habide hym thare, and hym selfe & a certane

Alexander after his awennÌ name.

In the mene tyme , Egipcyens herdÌ of Ã¾e comynges of Alexander, & Ã¾ay
went agaynes hym & submytt Ã¾amÌ vntiÆÆhym & resayffedÌ hym wirchipfully.
And whenÌ Alexander come intiÆÆ Egipte, he fand ane ymage of a kyng made

Anectanabus that was kynge of Egipte noÈte lange sythenÌ gane, Ã¾e wyseste

'Auectanabus was my Fader.' And Ã¾an he knelid dounÌ with grete reuerence
& kyssedÌ Ã¾e ymage. Fra thethynÌ he went wit his Oste to Surry. But Ã¾e
Surriens agaynestude hym and faghte wit hymÌ and slewe many of his

Damaske, & EnseggedÌ it & wanne it, and fra thethynÌ he went to Sydon &
wan it. And Ã¾anÌ he went vnto Ã¾e Citee of Tyre and layde Ensegge abowte
it, and Ã¾is Ensegge he laye many a day. And thare


 

his Oste suffredÌ many dysesseÈ. For Ã¾at Cite was so strange in itselfe
bycause of Ã¾e groundÌ, Ã¾at it was sett aponÌ, and bycause of grete
towres & many Ã¾at ware abowte it, and also bicause it was so enclosedÌ
wit the see Ã¾at it myghte noghte lightly be wonnenÌ by nane
assawte. Alexander Ã¾anÌ vmbithoghte hym, one what wyse he myghte best comÌ

and sett it aponÌ schippes in Ã¾e see euenÌ forgaynes Ã¾e cete, so Ã¾at Ã¾are
myghte no shippeÈ come nere the hauenÌ for to vetaille Ã¾e Citee or

Oste hade grete defawte of vetayÆÆs, and Ã¾anÌ he sent lettres vnto Iadus,
Ã¾at at that tyme was bischoppe & gouernoure of Ã¾e Iewes, and prayede hym

Ã¾at he scholde also sendÌ hym the tribute Ã¾at he scholde gyffe Darius Ã¾e
emperour of Perse. For hym ware better, he saidÌ, hafe his frenchippe Ã¾anÌ
Ã¾e frenchipe of Darius. The Bischope Ã¾anÌ of Ã¾e Iewes ansuerdÌ Ã¾e
messangers Ã¾at broghte hym Ã¾e lettres & saidÌ 'I hafe,' quoÃ¾ he, ' made
athe to Darius, Ã¾at, whils he leffeÈ, I schaÆÆ neuer bere armes agaynes

went till Alexander & talde hym Ã¾e bischopes ansuere, and he was greuedÌ
& saidÌ 'I make mynÌ avowe,' quÃ¾ he, 'vntiÆÆ oure goddes, Ã¾at I schaÆÆ
take swilke vengeance on Ã¾e Iewes Ã¾at I saÆÆ make Ã¾amÌ to knawe, whethir

And ane Ã¾at highte Caulus went baldly to Theosellas, & smate of his

Bertyne,


 

lorde of Ã¾e citee, seandÌ this, was gretely stirrede and ischewede owte

Ã¾e Macedoyns saw that grete multytude of folke comÌ apponÌ Ã¾amÌ, Ã¾ay were

Ã¾e grete multitude of Ã¾aire enemys ware dreuenÌ abakke, and lyke for to

and went wit his Oste to Ã¾e vale of Iosaphat, and fandÌ his menÌ riÈte
harde bystadde wit Ã¾aire enemys. And he and his Oste vmbylappedÌ alle
Ã¾aire enemys, and daunge Ã¾amÌ dounÌ & slewe Ã¾amÌ ilke a moder sonÌ. And whenÌ
he had so done he turnedÌ agayne vnto Tyre, and fande the Bastelle, Ã¾at
he hade made in Ã¾e See, dongenÌ doune to Ã¾e grounde. For alsonÌ als
Alexandere was gane fra Tire to Ã¾e vale of Iosaphat, BalanÌ Ã¾at was lorde
of Tyre ischewidÌ oute of Ã¾e citee wit thee folke Ã¾areof, & assailledÌ
the basteÆÆ manfully, and tuk it & dange it doune. And whenÌ Alexander
sawe that, he was gretly angerde, and his hert wonder heuy, and so ware
aÆÆe Ã¾e Macedoynes and the Grekes. In so mekiÆÆ thay ware nerehandÌ in
dispeire for to wynÌ Ã¾e citee, and ware in poynte to hafe riffen up Ã¾e

And thanÌ he garte make anoÃ¾er basteÆÆe in Ã¾e see, grettere, &

Alexander gert armede hynÌ suerely & wele, & wente by hym ane vp aponÌ

Fra Ã¾e segge of Tyre Alexander & his menÌ went to Ã¾e citee of GaÈa and
assailedÌit, & wit schorte while Ã¾ay wanÌ it. And Fra thethynÌ hyedÌ hym

QwhenÌ Ã¾e Bischoppe of Ã¾e Iewes herde teÆÆe Ã¾at Alexander was commaund

'I see wele Ã¾at aÆÆ thynÌ ansuers ere false.' Fra thethyn Alexander went

'SendeÈ me furthe,' quoÃ¾ he, 'foure hundreth knyghtis, wele armedÌ for to

Alexander fra Ã¾e citee of Thebe, went to Corynthe, and Ã¾are come tiÆÆ

And he grauntedÌ Ã¾amÌ. And to Ã¾is Ilke wrestillynge Ã¾are come folke

Alexander bad hym ga to. And Clitomarus went into Ã¾e place, and Ã¾e

Ã¾at he ment of Ã¾e citee of Thebe. And Ã¾an he garte his sergeanteÈ make a crye that haddÌ giffen Clitomarus leue for to repairelle
Ã¾e citee of Thebes. Fra Corinthe, Alexander and his oste remowedÌ tiÆÆ a

Scrassageras went to Ã¾e same temple, and alsone als Ã¾e preste sawe hym,

And whenÌ he herde Ã¾is he was righte wrathe wit hir, & saide, 'Ã¾ou arte

Scrassageras went to Ã¾e cite of AtheneÈ, and sare wepande he complenede

 ' Alexander, Ã¾e son of Philippe and of qwene Olympias, vn to the

The Athenyenes reddÌ Ã¾is lettre and Ã¾an Ã¾ay bigan to crye one highte. And

WhenÌ Ã¾e Athenyenes herdÌ Ã¾is lettre reddÌ, Ã¾ay ware riÈte gladdÌ, and Ã¾anÌ

The Lacedounes reddÌ Ã¾is lettre, and whenÌ it was reddÌ, Ã¾ay ware wonder

In this mene tymÌ, Alexander sembledÌ a gret multitude of folke to Ã¾e

kyng Alexander calledÌ tiÆÆ hym his Phicisiene Ã¾af highte Philippe & baddÌ

This prynce hade grete envy to Ã¾is phicsiene, bicause Ã¾at Alexander

In Ã¾e mane tyme, Ã¾is Phisician come tiÆÆ Alexander wit Ã¾e forsaid

'Now for sothe, my lorde,' quoÃ¾ he, 'I take oure goddes to witnesse Ã¾at
I ne am noÈte gilty of this tresonÌ, Ã¾at here es wretynÌ.' Alexander Ã¾anÌ
was aÆÆ hale als euer he was, & calledÌ vntiÆÆ Philyppe his phisician &

Fra Ã¾eine kyng Alexander remowedÌ his Oste tiÆÆ hermony Ã¾e mare & onane

perceyuedÌ Ã¾at murmoure of his folke, he said vnto Ã¾amÌ. 'What es Ã¾at,'
quoÃ¾ he, 'Ã¾at Èe say amangeÈ Èow, "If it faÆÆe Ã¾at we flee owte of Ã¾e

In Ã¾is mene tyme, kyng Darius gadirde a grete multitude of menÌ agaynes
Alexander, and ordeynedÌ ouer Ã¾amÌ fyvehundreth chyftaynes of
grete lordes and luged hym wit his menÌ aponÌ Ã¾e reuere of Tygre. And one

remenante saw Ã¾at, Ã¾ay tuk Ã¾amÌ to Ã¾e flighte. In Darius oste was a manÌ

swerde on heghte, & lete flye at hymÌ wit aÆÆ Ã¾e myghte Ã¾at he hade, and
hitt hym on Ã¾e heuedÌ so fercely, Ã¾at he perched his bacenett, and drewe
Ã¾e blode of hym. WhenÌ Alexander knyghtis saw that: Ã¾ay tuke hym anone, &
broghte hym bifore Alexander, and Alexander, supposyng Ã¾at he hadde bene
a macedoyne, saide vntill hym. 'WirchipfuÆÆ man,' quoÃ¾ he, '& doghety &

And Percyene ansuerdÌ, & saidÌ, 'Wiete Ã¾ou wele wirchipfuÆÆ

this dede I diddÌ. For kyng Darius made me a promysse of his doghetir to

& said: 'Sirs,' quoÃ¾ he, 'what wrange or what defawte canÌ Èe fynde in

if Èe myÈte be getynÌ.' And Ã¾an he commandedÌ Ã¾at he schulde
wende hame to his felawes witowttenÌ any harme. When Darius herde Ã¾at
his lordes ware slayne in grete nowmer, he gaderedÌ a grete multitude of
knyghtis and of fotemenÌ, and went vp on a hiÆÆ Ã¾at es calledÌ Taurisius,
and thare he made his mustre of his menÌ, supposynge Ã¾at he schuld

Ã¾aire bathere osteÈ, and biganÌ for to fighte, Darius menÌ fleddÌ and

and Ã¾are he luged hym, and offerde Sacrafice tiÆÆ his goddeÈ. And on Ã¾e
morne he garte assaile Ã¾e

And in Ã¾e mene tyme, whils Alexander lay at Batran: Ã¾are come a prynce
of Darius oste vntiÆÆ Alexander, & said vntiÆÆ hymÌ, 'WirchipfuÆÆ

 WhenÌ Darius had redde Ã¾is lettre, on ane he gert writte a lettir to

Ãis lettre gaffe Alexander to Ã¾e messangers of Darius and many grete

WhenÌ Darius redde Ã¾is lettre, he was gretly troubbledÌ and wepedÌ

In the mene tyme kyng Alexander remowedÌ his oste, and drew nere Ã¾e cite

On Ã¾e morne whenÌ Alexander rase fra slepe, he was gretly comforthedÌ of

frosenÌ ouer, and Alexander onane chaunged he wede, & lefte Ã¾e foresaidÌ
prynce wit twa horse at Ã¾e watersyde and hym selfe, wit Ã¾e horse Ã¾at he
satt aponÌ, went ouer Ã¾e water aponÌ Ã¾e YsÈ, towarde Ã¾e citee of Susis.
And his prynce besoghte hym Ã¾at he walde suffre hym wende wit hym, ne
perauenture any disesse feÆÆe hym by Ã¾e waye. And Alexander ansuerdÌ &
sayde, 'Habyde me here,' quoÃ¾ he, 'For he saÆÆ be my helpere, whamÌ in
dremeÈ I sawe appere vnto me.' This ilke water I spake of bifore, aÆÆ
Ã¾e wynter seson ilke a nyghte was frosenÌ aÆÆ ouer; bot tymely in Ã¾e
mornynge als sone als Ã¾e warme sonÌ smate aponÌ it, Ã¾anÌ it dissoluede
agayne, & ranÌ wonder swiftely; Ã¾e brede of Ã¾at water es Ã¾e space of a
furlange. When Alexander come to Ã¾e Èate of Ã¾e citee the Perciens, when
Ã¾ay saw hym, haddÌ grete wonder of his figure, and wendÌ he haddÌ bene a
goddÌ, and onane Ã¾ay askedÌ hym what he was ? And he ansuerdÌ and saidÌ he
was a messangere sent fra kyng Alexander to Ã¾aire lorde Darius, and belyfe Ã¾ay broghte hym til hym. Darius, when Alexander come bi fore hym,
said vntil hym. 'WhethynÌ ert Ã¾ou,' quoÃ¾ he ? 'I ame,' quoÃ¾ Alexander,
'sent vnto Ã¾e fra kyng Alexander to wiete where to Ã¾ou taries to come
tiÆÆ hymu to gyffe hym bateÆÆe. Owthir come & feghte manfully wit thyne
enemys or eÆÆs submitte Ã¾e tiÆÆ hymÌ & pay hym tribute.'

And Darius heard him and said, ' Art thou then the Alexander who with
such madness shaped thy speech, for I see thou holdest thyself not from
words as a messenger doth, but art bold as a king. Yet know that by thy
words I am not frightened at all. Come dine with me this day.' And with
these words, he reached out his hand to him and took him by his right,
and led him into the palace. And Alexander, musing, began to say: 'A
right good token hath this barbarian wrought me when he clasped my right
hand and drew me into 


 

the palace, because, as the gods say sooth, ere long the palace shall be
mine.' And going in, Darius and Alexander lay by a table, and the
daintiest feast was laid out. And Darius' marshall gazed hard at
Alexander face to face. And the table was wreathed in cleanest gold. But
the Persians, seeing Alexander's shape, yet knew nothing of what wisdom,
doughtiness, and strength lurked in this small body. The dishes and
tables and seats were wrought of the finest gold. The cupbearers bore
cups in golden vessels and rarest jewels. And when a cup was handed to
Alexander, he hid it in his breast. And another cup was brought to him
and he did the same, and thus too with a third. And those who bore the
cups, seeing this, gave the news to the Emperor Darius. And he, hearing
of it, rose up; saying: 'Friend, what is this that thou doest, hiding
the cups in thy breast?' And Alexander: 'In our king's feasts the guests
are wont, whenever they will, to take their drinkingvessels. But, as
this seemeth to you unworthy, I will give them back forthwith.' And with
these words he gave them back to the cupbearers. But the Persians who
sate at the feast said each to each, 'a good custom, indeed, and one to
be praised.' And some lords, too, praised this way and exalted it. But
one of the Princes of Darius, called Anapolus, sitting at the feast,
gazed hard at Alexander and his face. For he had seen him when, at
Darius' bidding, he went into Macedonia to take tribute of Philip. He,
knowing his voice and looking on his face, began to think to himself and
say: 'Is this not Alexander?' And rising at once he drew near to Darius,
saying: 'This messenger whom thou beholdest is Alexander, the son of
Philip of Macedon.' And Alexander, seeing them with each other in talk,
knew they were speaking of him and he was known. And at this he rose up
from his place and leapt away from the board. And taking a blazing torch
from a Persian's hand, himself mounted his palfrey, which he found ready
outside Darius's palace, and fled in the swiftest flight. And the
Persian seeing this, taking weapons, mounted their steeds with a mighty
stir, and quickly followed after Alexander. And in the darkness of the
nightfall, they began to stray, some scratched their faces by the treeboughs, some falling into ditches. But Alexander, bearing his blazing
torch in hand, fared straight 


 

forward. Now, Darius sate on his throne and thought of Alexander and how
great his daring was. He saw a statue of gold of Xerxes the Persian
king, who sate below the highseat in the hall. And at once the statue
broke and was all scattered asunder. And Darius seeing this was smitten
with heaviness of heart and began to weep sorely and long. And he said:
'This foretokeneth the wasting of my life, and the utter downfall of the
Persian kingdom.' Alexander, however, coming to the river Grancus, found
it swollen, and leapt athwart it. But ere he was over the stream burst
its banks, and swept his horse away; with great hardship Alexander
escaped and met Eumulus, his lord. And thus he went back to his army and
told them of Darius, how he had dealt with him, and the torch with which
he had fled away. 


 HOW ALEXANDER PUT HEART INTO HIS HOST ANEW.

And on the following day, he gathered his army, which told two hundred
and twenty thousand of weaponed men. And he went up 

 on a hye place & comforthed his menÌ and saidÌ vnto Ã¾amÌ: 'Ãe
multitude of Ã¾e percienes,' quoÃ¾ he, 'may noÈte be euend to Ã¾e multitude
of Ã¾e greckes. For sewrly we are ma Ã¾an Ã¾ay. And if Ã¾ay were ane
hundreth sythes maa thenÌ wee, late noÈte Èour hertis faile Èow Ã¾arefore.
For I telle Èow a grete multitude of flyes may do na harme till a fewee
waspes.' And whenÌ Ã¾e Oste had herde thire wordes Ã¾ay commendide hym
halelely wit a voyce.

ThanÌ Ã¾e emperour Darius remowedÌ his oste, and come to Ã¾e reuere of
Graunt on Ã¾e nyghte, and went ouer on Ã¾e ysÈ, and Ã¾ar he lugedÌ hym. The
Oste of Darius was wonder grete and strange. For Ã¾ay haddÌ in Ã¾aire oste
X^m cartes ordayndÌ For Ã¾e werre, and grete multitude of OlyfanteÈ, wit
towres of tree onÌ Ã¾amÌ, stuffedÌ wit feghtyng menÌ. And sone after apponÌ a
day thir twa kynges wit Ã¾aire osteÈ mett samenÌ on a faire felde, Darius
wit his menÌ, and Alexander wit his men.


 

Than Alexender lept aponÌ his horse, Ã¾at highte Buctiphalas, and rade
furthe bifore aÆÆ his oste, and houed in Ã¾e myddes waye bitwene Ã¾e twa
ostes. And whenÌ Ã¾e Percyenes saw hym, Ã¾a had grete wonder of hym, and
ware riÈte ferde for hym, by cause he was so vggly. NeuereÃ¾elesse Ã¾ay
trompedÌ vp & went towarde Alexander. And sone Ã¾e bateÆÆ ioyned, &
faghte togedir fersely, and many menÌ dyedÌ on ayther party; Ã¾are was so
thikke schott of arowes, Ã¾at Ã¾e ayer was couerde, as it had bene wit a

to Ã¾e sonÌsettyng. Bot Ã¾are dyedÌ many ma of Ã¾e percyenes Ã¾an Ã¾are dide

And whenÌ Darius sawe his menÌ faÆÆe so thikke in Ã¾e felde, he lefte Ã¾e
felde, and fledd, and Ã¾e percyenes seyng that, Ã¾ay fleddÌ also. Bot Ã¾anÌ

and Ã¾ay ne myÈte noÈte see for tiÆÆ eschewe Ã¾amÌ. WhenÌ Darius come to the foresaidÌ watere he fande it frosenÌ, and ouer he went. And
whenÌ he was ouer, Ã¾e oÃ¾er lordes of perse went apponÌ Ã¾e ysÈ, so grete a

this bateÆÆe Ã¾are was slaen of Ã¾e percyenes CCC^m witowtenÌ thase Ã¾at

Kyng Darius fleddÌ to Ã¾e citee of Susis, & went in tiÆÆ his palace, &
feÆÆe downe to Ã¾e grounde, & sigheand & wepande wit a sare hert, he saidÌ
theis wordes: 'Allas, fuÆÆ wa es me, vnhappye wriche, Ã¾at euer I was

he hade saide thir wordes, he rase vp, & satt & wrate a lettre vntill
Alexander, sayande on this wyese.

 kingsbip of the Medes and Persians, that thus ye may have and keep
 what victory Jove the allmighty hath granted you.'


 


 HOW THE MESSENGERS OF DARIUS GAVE ALEXANDER THE LETTER, AND HIS
 ANSWER.

The messengers of Darius coming then to Alexander gave him the letter,
which Alexander read soon before them all. Then one of his chieftains,
called Parmerion, said to Alexander: 'Most mighty emperor, take all the
wealth which Darius covenants unto thee, and give back to him his wife
and sons.' And, hearing this, Alexander called to him the messengers of
Darius, and before all spoke thus, saying: 'Tell ye to your emperor we
wonder first that he misdeemed his mother, wife, and sons to be betrayed
by our hands. If he be overcome, bid him not promise us a reward. If he
bow himself to our yoke, all his honours and the majesty of God shall be
laid bare to our sway. If he be not overcome, let him do us battle once
again.' This said, he gave them rich gifts and sent them forth away.
Then he bade the soldiers take up and gather the bodies of the dead and
bury them in graves: and he bade them heal those that were wounded.



 HOW ALEXANDER ENCAMPED BY THE STREAM GRANCUS.

Then he encamped with his host by the stream of Grancus, and wintered
there some days. And there he offered up victims to the gods. And about
the river there were palaces, and they were the fairest, raised up with
greatest skill, and Xerxes the King of the Persians had built them.
Alexander, seeing them, bade them be burned. And soon after this,
stirred by ruth, he gave word none should dare touch them. And there too
was a most fair and very wide field in which the Kings and Deemsters of
Persia were of old buried. And digging into this field the Macedonians
found in the graves gemmed vases. And there they found the grave of
Ninus the King of Assyria and Persia, which was hollowed out of a single
amethyst, and engraven on the outside with palmleaves and sundry kinds
of birds. And so bright was the amethyst that even from the outside the
man's body appeared whole. And in this place was a narrow and evil tower
on which stood many men, some with cut legs, some with broken thighs,
some with torn hands, and some blinded. They hearing 


 

the noise of the armed men cried out to Alexander, who bearing their
cries, bade them be taken thence. And seeing them was struck with ruth
and wept, and bade each one be given ten thousand drachmas, and be
restored every one to his own. For Darius kept them in prison, since
they were of noble birth, and awarded all their possessions to his
thralls. In the meantime the messengers from Alexander to Darius told
all that Alexander had said. And Darius hearing this began to get ready
for the fight. And he wrote another letter to Porus King of India, which
runneth as follows: 

THE LETTER SENT BY DARIUS TO PORUS KING OF INDIA.

'Darius King of the Persians to Porus King of Our Indians joy. We asked
but lately of you, and again we ask you to come and help against those
who strive to overthrow our palace. We know well also that the like harm
will light on you. For this Alexander, who fighteth thus, hath an
unquenchable and wild soul, which like a lion ceaseth not, and is like
the sea when stirred by mighty winds. Furthermore, unwillingly though it
be, we have gathered numberless races, and we have taken our counsel to

In the men tyme, certane menÌ of Darius went fra hym & come tiÆÆ
Alexander, & talde hym, Ã¾at Darius purposede hym for to feghte wit hym
eftesones, and had sent tiÆÆ Porus, kyng of Inde, for to come in grete
haste, for to helpe hym. WhenÌ Alexander herd Ã¾is, belyfe he remowedÌ his
Oste to wardÌ Darius, thynkand in his herte Ã¾at he wolde on na wyse take
aponÌ hym Ã¾e name of Emperour before he haddÌ wonnÌ Darius and his rewme
one werre. And when Darius herde of Ã¾e commyng of Alexander, he dreddÌ
hym gretly & Ã¾e percyenes also. Bot Ã¾are was two prynceÈ of Darius, of
Ã¾e whilke Ã¾e tane highte Bisso & Ã¾e toÃ¾er Ariobarsantes, thir twa whenÌ
Ã¾air herdÌ of Ã¾e comyng of Alexander, conspyredÌ togedir for to slaa Ã¾aire
lordÌ Darius, supposyng for tiÆÆ hafe a grete thanke of Alexander, and a
gret rewardÌ for Ã¾aire dede. And ayther of Ã¾amÌ ware sworne tiÆÆ oÃ¾er. And
thanÌ thay went to Ã¾e kynges palace, and come intiÆÆ his chamber wit
drawenÌ swerdes in Ã¾aire handeÈ, and fand Darius bi hym ane. And whenÌ
Darius saw that, he trowedÌ wele Ã¾at Ã¾ay wolde sla hymÌ, And said vnto
Ã¾amÌ: 'Dere frendeÈ, hedir to wardeÈ hafe I called Èow my seruaundeÈ, bot
now I call Èow my lordes. What ayles Èow at me Ã¾at Èe wiÆÆ sla me ? Haes

mercy, thurgâ his wordeÈ, Bot went tiÆÆ âym and wit grete cruelnesse
smate hym, & alto magle hym, and went faste Ã¾aire waye, & lefte hym for

And whenÌ Alexander herdÌ teÆÆ Ã¾at Darius was slayne he


 

went ouer Ã¾e water of Graunt, and aÆÆ his Oste wit hym, and come to Ã¾e
cetee of Susis. And alsone als Ã¾e percyenes saw hym, Thay Opened Ã¾e
Èates of Ã¾e citee, & rescheyuedÌ hymÌ wit grete wirchipe. And whenÌ Ã¾e

Ã¾ay went & helde Ã¾amÌ in hidils ay tiÆÆ Ã¾ay myÈte gete knaweynge of

Ã¾anÌ went into Ã¾e kynges Palace, and as he went Ã¾arein he merueyled hym
gretly of Ã¾e biggyng Ã¾areoff. For Cirus Ã¾e kyng of Perse gert bigg it
ryally. And the pament Ã¾areoffe was made of stanes of dyuerse colours, &
Ã¾e walles aÆÆ enueround wit fyne golde & precyous stanes & sternes lyke
to Ã¾e firmament, and pelers of golde Ã¾at bare vp Ã¾e werke. WhenÌ
Alexander saw aÆÆ this curious werke, he meruailedÌ hym gretly. And thanÌ
he went to Ã¾e chambre Ã¾are Darius laye halfe dede. And alsone als he saw
hymÌ he haddÌgrete rewthe & compassionÌ of hym, and he tuke off his awennÌ
mantiÆÆ & couerdÌ Ã¾arewit, & went and grapedÌ his wondes and wepidÌ

swelt in Alexander armes. Kyng Alexander, Ã¾anÌ, after Ã¾e customÌ was for
to bery emperours, gert araye Darius body als ryally as he couthe. And
wit aÆÆ Ã¾e solempnyte and wirchipe Ã¾at myghte be done, he helped hym
selfe for to bere Ã¾e bere, sare wepande, and gert Ã¾e Macedoynes & Ã¾e
Percyenes gaa bifore Ã¾e bere. The persyenes also wepedÌ wonder faste,
noÈte allanly for Ã¾e dede of Darius, bot for petee of Ã¾aire hertis, Ã¾at
Ã¾ay saw Alexander wepe so enterely. And whenÌ Darius was beriedÌ Alexander
went agayne to Ã¾e palace.

And one Ã¾e morne Alexander went and sett hym in a trone aÆÆ of golde &
precyous stanes, the whilke Cyrus sumtyme gert make Ã¾at was
kynge of Perse. And the Macedoynes and Ã¾e Persyenes sett aponÌ his hede a

precyous stanes, Ã¾at were sett Ã¾arein. And Ã¾e trone was aÆÆ of golde, &
of precious stanes, & ofÃ¾e sege Ã¾areoffe was vii seuenÌ cubeteÈ heghe
fra Ã¾e grounde, and a grece of seuenÌ greeÈ was made


 

Ã¾areto, whareby kynges ascended Ã¾areto. And thir greeÈ were mede
wonder craftyly & curyously. The firste gree was of ane amatist. The
seconde gree was of a SmaragdÌ. The threddÌ gree was of a TopaÈ. The
ferthe gree was of a granat. The fifte was of ane adamandÌ. The sext was
of fynÌ golde. And the seuennt was of clay. And thay ware noÈt wttenÌ grete causeÈ ordeynedÌ one Ã¾is wyse.

For Ã¾e first gree wne amatist, for amange aÆÆ oÃ¾er stanes it hase
this vertu, that it represses & haldeÈ donne Ã¾e fumositee of wyne & Ã¾e
myghte Ã¾areoffe, & suffers noÈte a manÌ Ã¾at bere it onÌ hym be troubbledÌ

solde ilke a kyng be of perfite witt & mynde, & thurgâ nane occasionÌ do

clere sighte of his hert, wysely for to see & discerne that Ã¾at es
spedfull & profitable bathe for hym selfe & for Ã¾e comonÌ profit. The
thirddÌ gree was of a TopaÈ, Ã¾e whilke es so clere, Ã¾at & a manÌ bihalde

kyng suld be schamfuÆÆ for tiÆÆ consent tiÆÆ any thynge Ã¾at es vnlefuÆÆ.
The fifte was of ane Adamande. Ãe Adamande es so harde Ã¾at it may noÈte

wit gayte blode. On Ã¾e same wyse a kyng suld be of so grete constance &
sadnesse Ã¾at, for na prayere, ne for na worldely gude, he solde noÈte

riÈte so a kyng awe to be preferredÌ before oÃ¾er menÌ & gouernours of Ã¾amÌ.
 Ãe seuent was of Clay, tiÆÆ Ã¾at entent Ã¾at a manÌ Ã¾at es

 'Alexander the sonÌ of goddÌ AmonÌ & qwene Olympias kyng of kynges &

Ãan gert Alexander aÆÆ menÌ be stiÆÆ, and said one this wyse: 'Whilke of

come bifore Alexander, and sayde vntiÆÆ hym: 'WirchipfuÆÆ emperour,'
quoÃ¾ Ã¾ay, 'we ere thase Ã¾at slew Darius thyne enemy wit oure AwennÌ

'swore Ã¾ou noÈte tiÆÆ vs, bi oure goddeÈ Ã¾at ere AlmyÈty, & bi Ã¾e hele

'So aughte me wele for to swere, for to gette knawyng of Ã¾e slaers of

Ã¾ay byganÌ to prayse Alexander & to commende hym and blysse hym as he
had bene a goddÌ. ÃanÌ kyng Alexander gert hede tha twa homycydes. And aÆÆ

And one Ã¾e morne Alexander sett hym in his trone, wit his corounÌ on his

RosanÌ, Darius doghter, wit a corounÌ onÌ hir hede, sett fuÆÆ of precious

hallely wit a voyce, 'Ã¾ou thi selfe es a goddÌ, For that Ã¾at es plesande

he, 'I pray Èow Ã¾at Èe wirchipe me noÈte as a goddÌ, for sothely I am as

Ãan gert Alexander write a lettre tiÆÆ Olympias his moder & tiÆÆ

Affter this kyng Alexander sembledÌ a grete Oste, bathe of macedoyns & of

In Ã¾e mene tyme it was talde Alexander, Ã¾at Porus, Ã¾e kyng of Inde, was

And Alexander & his menÌ persuedÌ Ã¾amÌ and slewe of Ã¾amÌ vic xxx iiij. And
Ã¾ay slew of Alexander knyghtes xxvij. In Ã¾at felde Alexander & his oste

Fra Ã¾eine pay remowedÌ and come tiÆÆ a grete ryuer, & lugedÌ Ã¾am Ã¾are. And

And whenÌ Ã¾ay come to Ã¾e

Fra Ã¾eine Ã¾ay went tiÆÆ Ã¾ey come to Ã¾e ferreste of Ã¾at waye ; and

And on Ã¾e morne Alexander OfferdÌ sacrafice tiÆÆ his goddes, And Ã¾anÌ he

And Ã¾anÌ Ã¾e alde manÌ saide tiÆÆ Alexander: 'Luke vp,' quoÃ¾ he, 'to Èone

Ã¾areby saÆÆ Ã¾ou witt Ã¾at it es a gude spiritt, Ã¾at knawes thi thoghte.'
Thir twa treeÈ were wonder hye. And Ã¾e tree of Ã¾e SonÌ hadÌ leues lyk fyne

And Ã¾an Alexander spirredÌ Ã¾e alde manÌ, in what langage Ã¾e treeÈ sulde

And as Ã¾ay stode Ã¾us spekande, Sudaynly Ã¾are come a bryghte beme fra Ã¾e

ÃanÌ biganÌ Alexander to thynke in his hert onÌ Ã¾is wyse,

 'Tell me now, haly tree,Wha he es Ã¾at sall slaa mee.'

And Ã¾anÌ Ã¾e tree of Ã¾e sonÌ ansuerdÌ by Ã¾ir twa verseÈ: 'Si tibi pandatur
vir qui tua facta resoluet,Illum confrynges & sic mea carmina fallent.'
Ãat es at say: 'And I schew the Ã¾e manes name, Ã¾at saÆÆ vndo thi dedis,

and Alexander and his twa prynceÈ went dounÌ by Ã¾e forsaide greeÈ & come

Apon Ã¾e morne Alexander & his Oste remowedÌ Ã¾eine & went agaynewardÌ

And Ã¾are at Ã¾e entree of Ã¾a twa forsaidÌ ways, Alexander gart rayse vp

Afftir Ã¾is Alexander gart make in Babyloyne a wonder curious trone of

After Ã¾is Alexander gert make a coronÌ of golde sett fuÆÆ of aÆÆ maner of

'Ortus & occasus, Aquilo michi seruit & Auster.' Ãat es at saye: 'Est &

Alexander was in babyloyne, a womanÌ was delyuer of a knaue childe Ã¾e

And fra Ã¾e nauyÆÆ downwardeÈ it had lyknesse of dyuerse besteÈ and was

And whenÌ Ã¾e philosopher saw it, he syghede, & saye wepandÌ sayde vnto

Ã¾ou saÆÆ passe oute of this werlde.' 'Telle me,' quoÃ¾ Alexander,
'whareby Ã¾ou knawes Ã¾at.' And Ã¾e philosophre ansuerde & sayde: 'My

Alexander herde Ã¾is he was wonder heuy, and sare wepandÌ he sayde on Ã¾is

In this mene tyme Ã¾are was in Macedoyne a lorde Ã¾at highte


 

Antipater, Ã¾e whilke of langetyme before haddÌ casten for Ã¾e dedde of

Ã¾erwith. For Olympias, Alexander moder, wrate vntiÆÆ hym oftesythes
and warnedÌ hym Ã¾at he scholde be warre wit Antipater & his childre, and
herefore was Antypater wonder sary. So aponÌ a tyme he vmbythoghte hym
Ã¾at he myghte neuer come aboute wit his purpose for to slaa Alexander,
bot if it ware thurgâ enpuysonynge. And so aponÌ a daye he went

quoÃ¾ he, gyffe it to kyng Alexander in his drynke, whenÌ he seeÈ his

and gretly byluffede & cheriste of hym. Bot so it befeÆÆe aponÌ a tyme
Ã¾at Alexander smate Iobas on Ã¾e heuedÌ wit a warderere for na trespasse.
Wharefore Iobas was gretly angredÌ and greuedÌ at Alexander and consentedÌ

And aponÌ a daye Alexander gart ordeyne a grete reueÆÆe in Babyloyne and

NeuerÃ¾elesse he feynedÌ & forbare a while & suffredÌ a grete penance,
and whenÌ he myÈte na langere habyde, he rase vp fra Ã¾e burde and saide

'I pray Èow sitt Èe stiÆÆ & eteÈ & drynkeÈ & beeÈ mery.' Bot Ã¾ay ware

broghte it tiÆÆ Alexander; and he tuk it & putt it in his throtte, and
belyfe Ã¾e puysonÌ vexedÌ hym ay mare & mare. And Ã¾anÌ
Alexander bade ane gange & openÌ Ã¾e palace Èates Ã¾at ware on Eufrates
