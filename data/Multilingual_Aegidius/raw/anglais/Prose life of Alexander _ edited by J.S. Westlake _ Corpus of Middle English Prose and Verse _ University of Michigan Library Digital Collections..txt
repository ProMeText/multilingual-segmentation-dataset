LIFE OF ALEXANDER


 How Anectanabus fled Egypt to Macedonia

The most learned Egyptians who know the size of the earth, the waves of
the sea, and the order of the heavens (betokening the way of the stars
and the turning of the skies), have bequeathed these things to the whole
world through the highness and the wisdom of magic knowledge. And they
tell of a king of that land, by name Anectanabus, great in
understanding, and full of love in astrology and mathematics. Now, upon
a day it happened that a messenger came, and said unto him that
Artaxerxes, king of the Persians, was drawing nigh towards him with a
very great force of foes. Yet he did not call out his army, nor get
ready his advance. Instead of this, he hurried into his bedchambers in
his palace, and, taking down a brazen shell, which was full of rainwater, and holding in his hand a brazen rod, sought by magic spells to
summon the devils. By which wizardry he felt, in the shell itself, the
fleets sailing over him amid fearful affray.

Now there were lords of Anectanabus set in sway over his armies to guard
the Persian border.

And one hapless man coming to him, besought him: 'O most mighty King
Anectanabus, there ariseth against thee Artaxerxes, the king of the
Persians, with an untold horde of foes and strange races. For they are
Parthians, Medes, Persians, Syrians, Mesopotamians, Brapes, Phares,
Argiri, Chaldaeans, Bachiri, Confires, Hircanians, and Agiophii, and
many other folks coming from Eastern lands.' On hearing this,
Anectanabus said, sighing: 'The trust that I gave to thee, heed thou
right well; yet thy prowess hath not been the prowess of a doughty man,
but the doings of a cowardly fellow. For worth showeth itself, not in
the greatness of the folk, but in the steadfastness of their souls. Dost
thou not know one lion putteth many




 

does to flight?' And having said these words, he went into his chamber
alone, and made brazen shells, and filled them with rainwater, and held
in his hand a palm rod, and gazing into this, began, as hard as he
could, to utter spells, and beheld how the Egyptians were being smitten
down at the onslaught of the Barbarians' ships.

Forthwith he changed his dress, and shaved his head and beard, and took
gold as much as he might bear, and which might be needful to him to busy
himself with wizardry. And thus he fled from Egypt, near by Pelusium.
And at length, coming into Ethiopia, he put on linen apparel, in
the guise of an Egyptian seer went into Macedonia. And there he sate
himself, and before all the Greeks, and in their sight was soothsaying.
But the Egyptians, when they saw how Anectanabus was not at Court, went
to Serapis, who was their greatest god, and besought him that he might
give them answer as to Anectanabus their king. And Serapis replied:
'Anectanabus, your king, is gone from Egypt because of Artaxerxes, the
king of the Persians, who will subdue you unto his lordship.
Nevertheless, when a short time hath flown by, he will come back to
shake off his thraldom, and will be avenged on your foes, and yoke them
under you.' And as soon as they had got this answer, they made a kingly
statue out of a black stone, in honour of Anectanabus. And they wrote on
it, at his feet, this saying, that it might be handed down for their
offspring to think of. But Anectanabus remained in Macedonia, nor was he
known.




 How Anectanabus went up to the Palace to Olympia the Queen.

In the meantime, Philip, king of Macedonia, went out to battle. But
Anectanabus went forward to the palace, that he might behold Olympia the
queen, and see how fair she was. And when he saw her, his heart was
smitten with love of her, and stretching forth his hand, he greeted her,
saying, 'Hail, Queen of Macedonia,' disdaining to call her 'lady'. And
she, Olympia, answered him, speaking thus: 'Hail, master, come thou and
sit near.' And when he sate thus, Olympia




 

asked many things of him. 'Art thou not an Egyptian?' And Anectanabus
answered: 'The word thou saidst was kingly, when thou didst name the
Egyptians. For the Egyptians are wise, and read dreams, understand the
birds of the air in their flight, open up the hidden places, and tell
the fate of those newborn, babes. Of all these things, as a seer, I,
too, have knowledge.' And Olympia saw how he gazed upon her, and spoke,
'Master, of what dost thou bethink thee, who thus lookest on me?' And
Anectanabus answered, 'I call to my mind many answers of the gods. One
answer had been that I was to look upon a queen.' And saying this, he
drew forth from his breast a cleansing tablet of bronze and ivory,
inwrought with gold and silver, and on its face were three whirls. The
first contained in itself the Twelve Minds, and in the third, sun and
moon were fashioned. Next to them, was seen a chain of ivory, and from
it he pulled forth sever wonderbright stars, that told the hours and
birthdooms of men, and seven carven stones, and two stones for the
saving men whole.

And Olympia beheld these things, and said: 'Master, if thou wouldst I
should believe thee, tell me the year, the day and hour of the king's
birth.' And upon this, he said to the queen, 'Wishest thou to hear
nothing else from me?' Quoth the queen, 'Tell me what shall fall out
betwixt Philip and me, for men say that, when Philip shall come from the
war, he will thrust me forth, and take another mate.' And Anectanabus
answered: 'They prate of many things untruly; but ere a long time pass,
it shall be as they say.' And the queen answered: 'I beg thee, master,
unveil me all the truth.' Thereupon Anectanabus:�'One of the mightiest
gods shall share thy bed and uphold thee through all thy thrivings and
downfalls, even if they be overstrong.' Olympia replied: 'I beseech
thee, say what shape this god shall put on?' Anectanabus replied:
'Neither young, nor old; his beard besprinkled with white hairs.
Wherefore, if this please thee, be ready for him, for at night shalt
thou see him, and in thy sleep shall he lie by thee.' The queen said:
'If I behold this, neither as a seer, nor as godly, but, as the god
himself, will I worship' . And at once Anectanabus said, 'Fare
thee well, O queen.' After this Anectanabus, leaving the palace, and
walking straight forth




 

to the city's camp in a desert spot, tore up herbs, and ground them, and
took their juice, and wrought spells and other like things of the fiend,
that in that same night Olympia might behold the god Hamon lying beside
her, and saying to her thereafter, 'Woman, thou hast conceived him who
shall beshield thee.' And, on the morrow, Olympia awoke from her
slumbers, and called Anectanabus to her, and told him of the dream she
had beheld. Then Anectanabus said: 'If thou wilt give me room in the
palace, thou shalt see the god himself, face to face. For that god shall
come to thee in the shape of a great snake, and soon after, taking on a
manlike body, he shall seem to be in my likeness.' And to this Olympia
said: 'As thou hast spoken, master, do. Take to thyself a bed in the
palace, and canst thou make good the truth thereof, I will deem thee to
be the father of the boy.' And, about the first watch of the night,
Anectanabus took on him, through spells and wizardry to be changed into
the shape of a great snake, and whistling on to the bedchamber of
Olympia, to fly through. And he entered her room, and rose on to her
bed, and with great love began to kiss her, and the kisses betokened to
her who he was. And when he rose up from the bed, he smote her on the
womb, and spake: 'This begetting be thy avenging, and in no wise may it
be upbraided of men.'

On such a fashion was Olympia cheated, who had lain with a man as though
he had been a god. And in the morning, Anectanabus went down from the
palace, and the queen was with child.

And when she began to be big, she called unto her Anectanabus, saying:
'Master, tell me, what doom will Philip wreak on me, when he shall come
back?' And Anectanabus said to her, 'Be not afraid: god Hamon will
champion thee.' And with these words he left the palace, and went
outside the town, to a barren spot. And, uprooting grasses, rubbed them,
and grated them, and took their sap. And he caught a seabird, and began
to sing over the herbs, and anoint the herbs with the sap. This he did
in fellowship with the fiends, that he might betray King Philip through
a dream. And this was brought about. That same night the god Hamon
appeared to Philip, in a dream, lying with his wife Olympia, and, the
night ended, he




 

saw him touch her womb, and seal it with a golden ring. And on the ring
there was a stone, and graven on this a lion's head, and the chariot of
the sun, and a very sharp sword. And he said to her: 'Woman, thou hast
conceived thy saviour.' And Philip awoke from his sleep, and calling
Arideus, made known to him the dream, and what he had seen. And Arideus
said: 'Philip, not from man, but from a god, hath thy wife conceived. In
truth, the lion's head and the chariot of the sun and the sharp sword,
foretoken that he, who shall be born of her, shall journey to the East
whence riseth the sun! And with the sharp sword shall he underyoke to
himself the nations of the whole world.'




 How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Mighty Dragon went to the fore
 in front of Philip and overcame his Enemies in the Fray.

In the meanwhile, King Philip fought and won. For there appeared in the
battle a dragon, who went before him and laid low his foes. And when he
came back to Macedonia, he met and kissed Olympia. And King Philip gazed
upon her, and said, 'To whom, O Olympia, hast thou given thyself up. For
sinned thou hast, yet not sinned, for as much as thou hast brooked
frowardness from a god. But I have seen all that has been done by a god
on thee, in a dream: therefore be blameless in my eyes, and the eyes of
all men!' 


 How Anectanabus in the Shape of a Dragon came before Philip at a
 Festival and kissed Olympia.

On a certain day Philip was feasting with his lords and chieftains of
Macedonia and with Olympia his wife. And Anectanabus through wizardry
took on himself the shape of a dragon, and, passing through the midst of
the couch whereon they lay apart, whistled so loudly that all the
revellers were stricken with fear, and the greatest dread, and coming
near Olympia, he put his head on her breast and kissed her. Philip,
seeing this, spoke to Olympia, 'Woman, thee and all I tell; beheld this
dragon, what time I laid my enemies low.' 


 


 How a Bird laid an Egg in Philip's Bosom at whose breaking there
 came forth a Serpent, which forthwith died.

And a few days after this Philip the king was sitting in his palace, and
there appeared unto him a little and most gentle bird, which flew into
his bosom and laid an egg. And the egg, falling to the ground, was
broken. And at once there crept forth from it a very little snake. And
it turned around, wishful to go into the egg, but, before it might put
in its head, it was quenched. And Philip, seeing this, was heavily
distressed, and called to him Arideus, and showed him the monstrous
thing he had seen. And Arideus said to him, 'King Philip, a son shall be
born to thee, who shall reign after thy death, and shall fare forth over
the whole world and sway all peoples, and ere he come back to the land
of his birth, shall die by a most swift death.'

And as the time of childbirth was drawing nigh, Olympia began to feel
pain, and her womb was tormented, and she bade Arideus be called to her,
and spoke with him: 'Master, my womb is wrenched with very heavy
labours.' Anectanabus then spake:
'Raise thyself awhile from thy throne, for in this hour the elements are
troubled by the sun.' This was done, and the pain went from her. And
soon after, Anectanabus said to her, 'Sit down, O Queen!' and she sate
herself and bore a child. And as soon as the boy was fallen on to the
earth, a mighty thunderclap and thunderbolts, with tokens and lightnings
came about throughout the whole world. Then night was spread forth and
lasted, it reaching unto the last hour of day. Then parts of the clouds
fell down in Italy. And seeing these signs, Philip the king was
afrighted, and went in to Olympia, and said: 'I deemed that this little
babe should in no wise be fostered. For he is not conceived of me, but
of some god, for at his birth I beheld the heavens changed. Yet let him
be fostered in my memory, as though he were my son, and follow in the
stead of a son I begot through another wife.' And when he said this, she
handled the babe with great care. And the boy's face had the likeness
neither of father nor mother. The hair on his head




 

was shaggy as a lion's. His eyes glistened like the stars, but each
beamed with its own hue, one black, the other yellow. And his teeth were
sharp, and his eager rush as a lion's. His shape foreshadowed his energy
and forethought. By his parents he was called Alexander. In the schools,
and wheresoever he sate, he strove with them in letters and
disputations, and by his keen swiftness won the mastership. And when he
was twelve years old, he was beweaponed for battle, and excelled in
arms. And Philip, seeing how quick he was, praised him, and said: 'Son
Alexander, I love thy speed, and wit of mind for its work. But I am sore
and feel foolish that thy form is no unlike mine.' And Olympia heard
this, and was greatly afraid. And she called hither Anectanabus, and
said: 'Master, learn from me what Philip misdeemeth. For he said to
Alexander, "Son, I love thy speed and wit of mind. But, that thy shape
is unlike mine, I am saddened."' And Anectanabus began to think, and
said: 'His thought is nowise harmful.' And gazing aloft as he was wont,
he looked on a certain star, and riddled out his wish. And when
Alexander heard this, he spake: 'The star thou seest is seen in the
heavens?' And Anectanabus replied: 'My son, it is.' Alexander said:
'Canst thou show it unto me?' Anectanabus answered: 'Follow me in the
hour of night, and I will show it unto thee.' Alexander said: 'Thy fate
is not known to thee, or uncertain?' Anectanabus replied: 'Enough of
this.' Alexander said: 'I would fain know it.' Anectanabus answered: 'In
truth know that from my son shall come my death.' This said, as he went
down from the palace, Alexander followed him in the hour of the evening
without the city. And when they arrived up on to the ditch of the city,
Anectanabus spake: 'Son Alexander, gaze thou on the stars; look how the
star of Hercules is perplexed, and how Mercury's star is blithe. If I
see Jove sparkling, my doom telleth me of my coming death at the hands
of my son.' At this sight Alexander came up nigh to him, and made an
onslaught on him, making him fall

 down̛ in to þe dyke, and
thare he feƚƚe, & was aƚƚ tofrusched̛; and þan̛ Alexander said̛ vnto hym
one this wyse. 'Fals


 

wreche,' quoþ he, 'that presumeȝ to teƚƚ thyngeȝ þat ere to com̛, reȝte
als þou were a prophete, and knewe þe preuateȝ of heuen̛. Now may þou see
that þou lyeȝ, And þarefore þou arte worthy to hafe swilke a dede.' And
than̛ Anectanabus ansuerd̛, & said̛: 'I wyste wele ynoghe,' quoþ he, 'þat I
scholde die swylke a dede. Talde I noȝte lange are to þe, that myn̛ awenn̛
son̛ schulde slae me ?' 'Whi, ame I thi son̛ ?' þan̛ quoþ Alexandire: 'ȝaa,
for sothe,' quoþ Anectanabus, ' I gat the.' And wit þat word̛, he ȝalde
þe gaste. And than̛ Alexander hert tendird̛ on̛ his Fader, And he tuke hym
vp on his bakke, and bare hym to þe palace. And when̛ his moder Olympias
saw hym, Scho said̛ vntiƚƚ hym. 'Son̛,' quoþ scho, 'what es that?' 'Als
thi foly hase made it,' quoþ he, 'so it es.' And than̛ he gert berye hym
wirchipfully.

In the mene tyme, a prynce of Macedoyne broghte þe kyng a horse vntemed̛, a grete and a faire; & he was tyed̛ on̛ ilke side wit chynes of
Iren̛, for he walde wery men̛ and ete þam̛. This ilke horse was called̛
Buktiphalas, bicause of his vgly lukynge, For he hade a heued̛ lyke a
buƚƚe, & knottiƚƚs in his frount, as þay had hene þe bygynnyng of
hournes. And when̛ þe kyng saw þe bewtee of this horse, he said tiƚƚ his
seruandis, 'Takeȝ this horse and putteȝ hym in a stable, and makes
barreȝ of yren̛ before hym, that thefeȝ and oþer mysdoers, þat saƚƚ be
done to dede, may be putt intiƚƚ hym, to be slaen̛ of hym. And þay didd̛
soo. In þe mene tyme þe kynge Philippe had̛ ane answere of his goddes,
that hee schulde regne nexte after hym, the whilke myghte ryde that
wylde horse witowtten̛ harme. So it feƚƚe þat Alexander þe whilke was
þan̛ twelue ȝere alde, wexe strange & reȝte hardy, & was wysse and
discrete; for he was wele lered̛ & connand̛ in aƚƚ þe seuen̛ sciences, þe
whilke twa philosophirs had teched̛ hym : þat es to say, Arestotle &
Calistene. And one a day, as Alexander passed̛ forby þe place þare als
þe foresaide stode, he luked in betwene þe barreȝ of yrnne and saw,
bifore þe horse, mens hend̛ and fete, & oþer of þaire membris, liggand̛
scatered̛ here & thare, and he had̛ grete wonder þareoff. And he putt in his


 

hande bitwene þe barreȝ, And þe horse strekede oute his
nekke, als ferre als he myghte, and likked̛ Alexander hand̛; and he knelid̛
doun̛ on̛ his kneesse, and bihelde Alexander in þe vesage langly. And
Alexander vnderstode wele þe wiƚƚ of þe horse, and opynd̛ the barreȝ, and
went into þe horse, and straked̛ him softely on þe bakke wit his riȝte
hand̛; And belyfe þe horse wexe wonderly meke tiƚƚ Alexander; and riȝte
as a honde wiƚƚ couche when̛ his maister biddes hym, so dide he tiƚƚ
Alexander; and Alexander lukede besides hym, & sawe a sadiƚƚ & a brydeƚƚ
hyng thare; and he tuke & dyd̛þam̛ on̛ hym̛, & leppe one his bakke & rade
furthe on̛ hym. And when̛ the kynge Philippe sawe hym do so, he said̛ vntiƚƚ hym 'Mi son̛ Alexander' quoþ he: 'Aƚƚ þe ansuers of our goddeȝ are
fulfillede in the! For when̛ I ame dede, þou mon̛ regne after me' And
Alexander ansuerd; & said̛ 'I pray the, Fader,' quoþ he, 'ordeyne me
horse & men̛, for I gaa seke dedeȝ of armeȝ.' 'For sothe' quoþ þe kynge
wit a glade chere, 'Take þe a hundreth horse, and xl thosandeȝ pounde of
golde; and take wit the of þe worthieste knyghteȝ þat langeȝ to me, and
wendis furthe.' And he didd̛so.

And he tuke wit hym also a philosopℏre þat highte Eufestius, whilke he
traysted̛ mekiƚƚ in, And twelue childre þat he chese to be his playfers,
and went hym furthe, and come intiƚƚ a contreth þat es called Polipone.
And when̛ the kynge of þe land̛ herd̛ teƚƚ, þat swilke men̛ ware entred̛ into his rewme in swilke araye, he raysed̛ a gret Oste, and come agaynes
Alexander for to feghte wit hym̛. And when̛ he come nerehand̛ hym, he said̛
vntiƚƚ hym. 'Teƚƚ me' quoþ he 'whatt þou ert ?' And Alexander ansuerd̛
'I am Alexander' quoþ he 'þe son̛ of Philippe, þe kynge of Macedoyne.'
'And what hopeȝ þou þat I be ?' quoþ þe kynge tiƚƚ hym. And Alexander
ansuerd̛. 'Þou ert kynge of Arridouns' quoþ he. 'Neuerþelesse, if aƚƚ I
do þe þat wirchippe þat I calle þe kynge, empride þe nathynge þareof.
For men̛ seeȝ ofte tymes men̛ þat ere in heghe astate com̛ to lawe degree,
& men̛ þat ere in lawe degree, come tiƚƚ heghe astate.' 'Þou sais riȝte
wele' quoþ þe kynge. 'Take hede to thyn̛ awen̛ selfe!' And Alexander
ansuerd̛ & said 'Ga hethen̛ away fra me' quoþ he 'for þou can̛ say noghte
to mee, ne I hafe noghte at do wit þe.' And þan̛ þe kyng was worder
wrathe, And said tiƚƚAlexander


 

'Luke on me' quoþ he 'þat spekes to the: Fore I swere the be my
Fader hele, & I anes spitte in thi face, þou schale dye.' And wit þat he
spitte at Alexander, & said̛: 'Take þe þare, þou biche whelpe, þat þe
semeȝ tiƚƚ hafe.' And Alexander stepped̛ furthe, & said̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛. 'For
þou' quoþ he 'hase dispised me, bycause I ame littiƚƚ; I swere þe, bi
þe pete of my Fader, & by my moders wambe, in þe whilke I was consayued

swerd̛, & brynge it vnder my subieccionn̛, or þou schaƚƚ make me subiecte
vnto þe.' And þare þay assignede day of Bateƚƚe; and ayther of þam̛ went
hame fra oþer.

And agaynes þe day of Bateƚƚe, Alexander, bi ascent & ordynance of kynge
Philippe, gadird a grete Oste, & went to the place þare þe Bateƚƚe was
assigned, and fand aƚƚ redy þare, kyng Nicoƚƚ and his oste. And þay
trumpped̛ vp appon̛ bathe þe parties, and bigan̛ to feghte, & many men̛ ware
slaen̛ on̛ bathe þe sydeȝ. Bot at þe laste, Alexander hade þe felde, &
tuke kyng Nichoƚƚ, & gart smytte of his heued̛, & went intiƚƚ his land,
and conquered it; and his knyghtes went and coround̛ hym kynge þareoff.
And sythen̛ he went hame tiƚƚ his fader, kyng Philippe, and fand̛ hym
sittand̛ at the mete at a bridale: For he had put awaye fra hym his wyfe
Olympias, Alexander moder, and taken̛ hym anoþer þat highte Cleopatra;
And Alexander went into þe hauƚƚe, and said vnto þe kynge Philipp̛:
'Fader,' quoþ he, 'I pray ȝow, þat for a rewarde of my firste iournee
þat I hafe now made, ȝee graunte me to take my Moder Olympias agayne vnto ȝow, & do to hir as awe to be done to a qwenne, rathere þan̛ I gyffe

ansuerd̛ & said̛ to þe kyng: 'lord̛' quoþ he 'þou schall hafe a son̛ of
Cleopatra, and he schaƚƚ regne after þe !' Alexander, than̛, was gretly
greuede at his wordes, and wit a wardrere þat he hade in his hande, he went


 

tiƚƚ hym and kellede hym. When̛ kyng Pℏilippe sawe this, he was gretly
stirred̛, and rase vp, & gatt a swerde & ranne towardeȝ
Alexander, for to hafe smytten̛ hym̛. Bot onane he feƚƚe down̛; and ay þe
nerre Alexander þat he drewe, þe mare he feƚƚe to the erthe riȝte as he

es it soo, that þou, þat hase wonn̛ wit dynt of swerde aƚƚe Grece, ne
hase now na strenghe to stande on thi fete.' And þan̛ aƚƚ þe hauƚƚe was
troubbled, and the brydale letted. And Alexander went abowte þe hauƚƚe,
and keste doun̛ þe bourdeȝ wit þe mete, & þe drynke þat ware appon̛ þam̛,
and tuke Cleopatra, and schotte hir oute at þe hauƚƚe dore. And the
kynge Philippe, for sorowe þat he tuke tiƚƚ, feƚƚe grefe seke. And a
littiƚƚ afterwardeȝ, Alexander went tiƚƚ hym for to vesett hym &
comforthe hym, and said̛ vntiƚƚ hym 'Philippe,' quoþ he, 'if aƚƚ it be
noȝte semely, þat I calle þe be þi propre name; neuereþelesse, noȝte
as þi son̛, bot as þi gud̛ frend̛, I saƚƚ teƚƚe the myn̛ avice. It es fully
my consaile þat þou reconnselle agayne vnto the my lady, my Moder
Olympias, and at þou grefe þe nathynge at þe dede of Lesias, ne take na

vngudely, þat þou drewe þi swerde for to smytte me þarewit.' And when̛
Philippe herd̛ þir wordes, his hert tendird̛, & he bigane to wepe. And þan̛
Alexander went tiƚƚ his Moder Olympyas, and said̛ vntiƚƚ hir: 'Be noȝte
ferde' quoþ he 'ne be noȝte heuy to my fader, for if aƚƚe thi trespas be
preuee, & noȝte knawen̛, neuerþelesse þou erte in party to blame.' And
when̛ be hade sayde thus, he ledd̛ hir furthe to þe kyng Philippe. And he
tuk & kyssid hir, and thus was scho reconnselde vntiƚƚ hym agayne.

After þis, þare come messengers Fra Darius, þe emperour of Perse, to
kyng Philippe, and asked̛ hym tribute And Alexander answerd̛ to thir
messengers, & saide, 'Saise to Darius, ȝour lorde,' quoþ he, 'þat sen̛ þe
tyme þat Philippe son̛ was waxen̛ of age þe hen þat ay es waxen̛ barayne &
consumed̛


 

awaye, and so es Darius pryuede of his trybute.' And thir
messengers herd̛ thir wordes; þay hade grete wounder of þam & of þe witt
& þe wisedome of Alexander.

In þe mene tyme tythyngeȝ come to kyng Philippe, þat Ermonye, þe whilke
bifore was suget vntiƚƚ hym, was rebeƚƚe & raysse agaynes hym. And he
garte semble a grete Oste, and sent Alexander thedir þare wit to
feghte wit þam̛, and to putt þam̛ agayne vnder his subieccionn̛. Alexander
than̛went wit this Oste tiƚƚ Ermony & broghte it agayne in subieccion̛, as
it was bifore.

An in þe mene tyme, whils he was þare, a lorde of Macedoyne þe whilke
highte Pansamy, a strange man̛ & a balde, suget vnto Philippe, and bade
of lange tyme couette for to hafe þe quene Olympias, conspirede agaynes
þe kynge, and come with a grete multytude of folke appon̛ þe kynge, to
fordo hym. And when̛ tythyngeȝ here of come to kyng Philippe, he went to
mete hym in þe felde wit a fewe menȝee. And when̛ he sawe þe grete
multitude þat Pansamy hade wit hym, he turned̛& fledd̛, and Pansamy
persued̛ after hym̛, and ouerhied̛ hym, and strake hym thurghe wit a spere,
and ȝitt ife aƚƚ he were greuosely wonded̛, he dyed̛ noȝte alsone, bot he
laye halfe dede in the waye. And than þe Macedoynes, þat wenede he bade
bane dade, made mekiƚƚ sorowe. And when þis iournee was done Pansamy was
gretly empridede þare offe, & went in to þe kynges palace for to take þe
qwene Olympias oute of it and hafe hir with hym. And euen̛ þe same tyme,
Alexander come fra Hermony, & sawe swylke trouble & styrrynge in the
rewme, and hyed̛ hym faste towarde þe kynges palace, and when Olympias
herd̛ teƚƚe þat Alexander hir son̛ had þe victorye of his enemys, & was
comande nere, Scho went furthe of þe palace at a preuee posterne to mete
hir son̛, and to welcome hym hame. And alsone als scho come nere hym,
scho criede appon̛ hym̛ & said̛.

'A A, my son Alexander, whare es þe grace & þe fortune þat oure goddes
highte the, þat es to say, þat þou scholde alwaye ouercome thynn̛ enemys
& noȝte be ouercomen̛, þat Pansamy hase one þis wyse slaen thi Fader.'
And alsone the worde come to Pansamy þat Alexander was comen̛, and he
went furthe of palace for to mete hym̛. And also faste als Alexander sawe
hym, he oute wit a swerd̛ and clafe his heued̛


 

in to þe tethe, & slewe hym. And ane of þe Oste said̛ tiƚƚ Alexander:
'Philippe þi fader' quoþ he, 'lyas dade in þe felde.' And þan Alexander
went thedir thare he laye, and saw hym euen̛ at þe dyinge. And þan̛ he
began̛ faste for to wepe. And Philippe luked apon̛ hym̛, & said̛ 'A A, my
dere son Alexander,' quoþ he, 'wit a glade hert may now dye, for þat
þou so soune hase venged̛ my dede,' & euen̛ wit þat worde he
ȝalde þe gaste. And Alexander wirchipfully gert hym be entered̛.

When kyng Philippe was entered, Alexander went and sett hym in his
trone, and gerte calle byfore hym alle þe folke þat was gaderd̛ thedir,
lordes & oþer, and said̛ vnto þam̛ on þis wyse. 'Men̛,' quoþ he, 'of
Macedoyne of Tracy, and of Grece byhaldeȝ þe fegure of Alexander and
putteȝ oute of ȝour hertes drede of aƚƚe ȝour enemys. For sekerly, and

And when̛ þe lordes and knyghtis þat ware of grete age, herd̛ thir wordes
þay ansuerd̛ Alexander, & said̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛: 'lorde,' quoþ thaye, 'we hafe
seruede ȝoure fader a longe tyme & traueld̛ wit hym in his werres, &
þarefore we ere now so bryssed̛ in armes þat þare no myghte lefte

'chese þe sadnesse of an alde wyse man̛ than̛ þe vnavesy lightenesse of

alowed̛ his hie witte and hally þay assentede to hym for to do his lyste.

Sone after Alexander assemblede a grete Oste, & went bi Schippe towardeȝ Ytaly, and als he come by Calcedoyne, he assaylled̛ it reȝte
strangly, and þe folke of Calcedoyne went to þe walles of þe
Citee and defendid̛ manly. Bot at the laste Alexander wan̛ the Citee, and
fra thethyn̛ he Schippede intiƚƚ Italy. And alsone als þe Romaynes herd̛
of his comynge þay were wonder ferde for hym̛, and the grete lordes of þe
lande tuke fourty thowsandeȝ of besandeȝ and I^c corounes of golde, and
went vntiƚƚ hym̛, and presant hym wit þam̛ & bysoughte hym þat he scholde
noȝte werrey appon̛ þam̛, ne do þam̛ na harme. And than Alexander tuke
trybute of þe Romaynes, and of aƚƚe the folkes þat duelt bitwixe that &
þe weste Occeane, þe whilke regione es callede Europe, & lefte þam̛ in
gude pesse.

Fra thethyn he Schippede intiƚƚ Affrice, in thee whilke he fande bot
fewe þat rebelled̛ agaynes hym and þarefore als swa saye, eneil
sodeynly he conquerid̛ it & broghte it vnder his subieccion̛. And fra
Affric he went by Schippe tiƚƚ ane Ile, þat es called̛ Frontides, for to
consaile wit a godd̛ þat þay called̛ Amon̛. And as Alexander & his men̛ went
towardeȝ þe temple of þis forsaid̛ godd̛, þay mett in þe waye a grete
hert þe whilke Alexander bad his men̛ sla wit arowes. And þay schott at
hym; bet nane of þam̛ myghte hitt hym. And þan̛ Alexander tuke a bowe &
schotte at hym & hitt hym & slewe hym. And þan̛ Alexander went into þe
temple, & made sacrafyce of þis hert vnto godd̛ Amon, and bysoughte hym
þat he schulde gyffe hym ansuares. When̛ Alexander hade made his prayers
þare to godd̛ Amon̛, he went wit his Oste intiƚƚ a place þat highte
Taphoresey, In þe whilke were feftene gude townues, & þay bade twelne
grete reuers þat rane into þe see, and at þe entree of þam̛ into þe see
þare was drawen̛ ouer grete chynes of yryne, and thare Alexandir made
Sacrafice tiƚƚ his goddeȝ. And on þe same nyghte, a godd̛ þat 
Serapis apperid vntiƚƚ hym in his slepe, cledd̛ in riche clothynge in
ane horrible forme & a dredefuƚƚ, and said̛ vntiƚƚ


 

hym. 'Alexander,' quoþ he, 'may þou take þis montayne on þi schulder &
bere it away?' Quoþ Alexander, 'how myghte any man̛ do pat?' And Serapis
ansuerd̛ & said̛, 'righte as þis montayne saƚƚ neuer witowten

prophycye hym what kyns dede he scholde die. Serapis ansuerd and said,
'It es noghte spedfuƚƚ tiƚƚ a man to knawe his paynefuƚƚ endynge. For if

Cite of Askalon̛ and bad þaim̛ habide hym thare, and hym selfe & a certane
of menȝe wit hym habade & thare he garte make a Citee & called̛ it
Alexander after his awenn̛ name.

In the mene tyme , Egipcyens herd̛ of þe comynges of Alexander, & þay
went agaynes hym & submytt þam̛ vntiƚƚhym & resayffed̛ hym wirchipfully.
And when̛ Alexander come intiƚƚ Egipte, he fand ane ymage of a kyng made
of blake stane curiousely coruen̛, and he askede þe Egipciens whase ymage
it was, and þay ansuerd̛ & said, 'It es þe ymage,' quop þay, 'of
Anectanabus that was kynge of Egipte noȝte lange sythen̛ gane, þe wyseste
& þe worthiest þat euer was þarein̛.' For sothe quoþ Alexander,
'Auectanabus was my Fader.' And þan he knelid doun̛ with grete reuerence
& kyssed̛ þe ymage. Fra thethyn̛ he went wit his Oste to Surry. But þe
Surriens agaynestude hym and faghte wit hym̛ and slewe many of his
knyghtes. Neuer þe lesse Alexander had þe victorye. And þan̛ he went to
Damaske, & Ensegged̛ it & wanne it, and fra thethyn̛ he went to Sydon &
wan it. And þan̛ he went vnto þe Citee of Tyre and layde Ensegge abowte
it, and þis Ensegge he laye many a day. And thare


 

his Oste suffred̛ many dysesseȝ. For þat Cite was so strange in itselfe
bycause of þe ground̛, þat it was sett apon̛, and bycause of grete
towres & many þat ware abowte it, and also bicause it was so enclosed̛
wit the see þat it myghte noghte lightly be wonnen̛ by nane
assawte. Alexander þan̛ vmbithoghte hym, one what wyse he myghte best com̛
to for to destruy þis citee, and he gerte make a grete basteƚƚ of tree,
and sett it apon̛ schippes in þe see euen̛ forgaynes þe cete, so þat þare
myghte no shippeȝ come nere the hauen̛ for to vetaille þe Citee or
suppoeƚƚ it wit men̛ bycause of þe basteƚƚe. In þe mene tyme Alexander
Oste hade grete defawte of vetayƚƚs, and þan̛ he sent lettres vnto Iadus,
þat at that tyme was bischoppe & gouernoure of þe Iewes, and prayede hym
for to suppoeƚƚ hym wit som̛ men̛, and also þat he walde send̛ sum̛ vetails
for hym & his Oste, and he scholde pay for þam̛ wit a glade chere, and
þat he scholde also send̛ hym the tribute þat he scholde gyffe Darius þe
emperour of Perse. For hym ware better, he said̛, hafe his frenchippe þan̛
þe frenchipe of Darius. The Bischope þan̛ of þe Iewes ansuerd̛ þe
messangers þat broghte hym þe lettres & said̛ 'I hafe,' quoþ he, ' made
athe to Darius, þat, whils he leffeȝ, I schaƚƚ neuer bere armes agaynes

went till Alexander & talde hym þe bischopes ansuere, and he was greued̛
& said̛ 'I make myn̛ avowe,' quþ he, 'vntiƚƚ oure goddes, þat I schaƚƚ
take swilke vengeance on þe Iewes þat I saƚƚ make þam̛ to knawe, whethir
it es better to þam̛ to be obeisant vnto commandement, or vnto
þe kynges of Perse.' And he callede a duke, þat highte Melagere, and wit
vc men̛ of armes, and badd̛ þam̛ gaa in to þe vale of Iosaphat, þe whilke
was fuƚƚ of besteȝ & brynge of thase besteȝ to þe Oste for to vetaiƚƚe

went in to þe vale, and gadird̛ to gedir catell witowte nombir & began̛

slewe many of þam̛. Bot Melagere & his felaws at þat tym̛ had þe better.
And ane þat highte Caulus went baldly to Theosellas, & smate of his

Bertyne,


 

lorde of þe citee, seand̛ this, was gretely stirrede and ischewede owte
of þe citee & wit xxx feghtyng men̛ and sett vp a schowte apon̛ the
Macedoynes aƚƚe at anes, that aƚƚe þe erthe trembled̛ witaƚƚe. And̛ when̛
þe Macedoyns saw that grete multytude of folke com̛ appon̛ þam̛, þay were
reȝte ferde. And þan Melagere walde hafe sent a Messangere to þaire
lorde Alexander, for to come & socoure þam̛, bot he mygte fynd̛ na man̛ þat
walde vndertake þe Message. Than thir twa batalles met Samen̛ & faughte
togedir, and thare was Sampson slaen, and Bertyne. And þe Macedoyns wit
þe grete multitude of þaire enemys ware dreuen̛ abakke, and lyke for to
be dreuen̛ abakke & discomfites. And ane of þe grekkes, þat highte
Arttes, seynge þe meschefe þay stode In, wann̛ hym owte of the Bataile &
went in alle þe haste, þat he myghte, tiƚƚ Alexander & talde hym þat þe
Grekkes & þe Macedoynes ware in poynte to be mescheuede, bot if he
suppoellde þam̛ þe tittere. And than Alexander lefte þe segge of Tyre,
and went wit his Oste to þe vale of Iosaphat, and fand̛ his men̛ riȝte
harde bystadde wit þaire enemys. And he and his Oste vmbylapped̛ alle
þaire enemys, and daunge þam̛ doun̛ & slewe þam̛ ilke a moder son̛. And when̛
he had so done he turned̛ agayne vnto Tyre, and fande the Bastelle, þat
he hade made in þe See, dongen̛ doune to þe grounde. For alson̛ als
Alexandere was gane fra Tire to þe vale of Iosaphat, Balan̛ þat was lorde
of Tyre ischewid̛ oute of þe citee wit thee folke þareof, & assailled̛
the basteƚƚ manfully, and tuk it & dange it doune. And when̛ Alexander
sawe that, he was gretly angerde, and his hert wonder heuy, and so ware
aƚƚe þe Macedoynes and the Grekes. In so mekiƚƚ thay ware nerehand̛ in
dispeire for to wyn̛ þe citee, and ware in poynte to hafe riffen up þe
segge. And one þe nyghte nexte suande, Alexander, als he laye & slept,
dremyd̛ þat he hadd̛ in his hand̛ a grape, þe whilke hym thoghte he keste
downe vnder his fete, and trade þareone, & alsone þare ran̛ oute of it a
grete dele of wyne. And when̛ Alexander wakned̛, he called̛ tiƚƚ hym̛ a
Philosophre & talde hym his dreme. And þe Philosophre ansuerde, 'be
balde,' quoþ he, '& lefe noȝte to ensegge Tyre, for þe grape þat þou


 

helde in thi hand̛, and keste vnder thi fete, and trade þareone, es þe
Citee of Tyre, þe whilk þou saƚƚ wynn̛ thurgℏ strentℏ and trede it with
thi fote, and þarefore be nathynge abaiste.' When Alexander herd̛ thire
wordes, he was gretly comforthed̛, and vmbithoghte hym̛ one whate wyse he
myghte gette this Citee.

And than̛ he garte make anoþer basteƚƚe in þe see, grettere, &
hyere, and strangere þan þe toþer was. For it was hiere þan̛ þe hegheste
towre of þe citee. And þis basteƚe was tyede wit a hundrethe ankers. Þan̛
Alexander gert armede hyn̛ suerely & wele, & wente by hym ane vp apon̛
this basteƚƚe, and badd̛ aƚƚ his men̛ þat þay schulde make þam̛ redy for to
feghte & to giffe assawte to þe citee. And alsone als þay sawe hym
entire in to þe citee, þay scholde aƚƚ at anes presse to þe walles, and
scale þam̛, and clymbe ouer þe walles baldely & wyn̛ þe citee. And when̛
aƚƚ men̛ weren̛ redy, hee gerte smyte soundere þe cabiƚƚs þat þe basteƚƚe
was tyed̛ wit, & þe wawes of þe see bare it to þe walles of þe Citee. And
Alexander delyuerlye stert apon̛ walles, whare Balan̛ stode, and ran̛
apon̛ hym & slew hym and keste hym ouer þe walles into þe dyke of þe
citee. And when̛ þe Macedoyns & þe Grekes sawe Alexander entir into þe
citee, þay schouffed̛ to þe walles aƚƚ at anes, and clambe ouer, sum̛ wit
leddirs sum̛ on oþer wyse witowtten̛ any resistence. For þe Tyreyenes was
so ferde bycause of þe dedde of Balan̛ þaire duc þat þay ne durste noghte
turne agayne no defende þe walleȝ. And on̛ this wyse was þe citee taken̛
and doungen̛ doune to þe erthe.

Fra þe segge of Tyre Alexander & his men̛ went to þe citee of Gaȝa and
assailed̛it, & wit schorte while þay wan̛ it. And Fra thethyn̛ hyed̛ hym
towardeȝ Ierusalem for to ensegge it.

Qwhen̛ þe Bischoppe of þe Iewes herde teƚƚe þat Alexander was commaund

commandid̛ þam̛ þat þay schuld̛ com̛ to þe temple, and be þare in praynge
Fastyngeȝ and wakynge & in sacrafice makyng vnto godd̛, bisekand hym of
helpe & socoure. And þay did̛ soo. And on þe nyghte nexte


 

after, when þe Bischoppe hadd̛ made his sacrafice, and was lyand̛ in
prayers, he feƚƚ on slomeryng and ane Angeƚƚe appered̛ vntiƚƚ hym, and
sayd̛, 'Be noȝte ferd̛,' quoþ he, 'bot swythe gere araye honestly aƚƚ þe

And þis es þe cause I wirchipped hym.' And when̛ he hadd̛ said̛ thies

Alexander than̛ went fra Ierusalem, & lefte thare Andromac his Messagere,
and hym selfe & his Oste went to þe oþer citeȝ þat ware in þe lande of

Darius spirred̛ thaym̛ of his stature & of his schappe, and þay schewed̛

and belyfe he gerte


 

write a lettre and sent it till Alexander. And þarewit he sent hym a

lettre þat he sent tiƚƚ hym.

 'Darius, kyng of kynges, and lord̛ of aƚƚ erthely lordes euen̛ like

 'Bot noȝte witstandynge þis; þou as a littiƚƚ bisne & a dwerghe, a

When̛ þe messangers þat were sent fra Darius come to king Alexander, þay
gaffe hym the lettres, and þe baƚƚe & oþer certane Iapes, þat þe
emperour sent hym in scorne. And Alexander tuke þe lettres, and gert

Alexander sawe þam̛ so heuy by cause of þe lettre, he saide vnto þam: 'a

When Alexander had̛ saide thir wordeȝ he bade his knyghtis take the
messangers of Darius and bynd̛ þaire handeȝ bihynde þam̛, & lede þam̛

Þan̛ kyng Alexander badd̛ his knyghtis lowse þam̛, and bryng þam̛ intiƚƚ

And as þay satt at the mete, þir messangers saide vn tiƚƚ Alexander,

When̛ þis lettre was wreten̛, Alexander called̛ till þe messangers of þe

 'Darius kyng of kynges and lorde of lordes vntiƚƚ oure trewe legeȝ

When̛ Darius hadde redde þis lettre, þare come anoþer messanger till hym

When̛ þe Messangers of Darius come tiƚƚ Alexander, þay tuk hym þe lettre

 'Alexander þe son̛ of Philippe & of qwene Olympias vnto Darius kynge

This lettre bekende Alexander to þe knyghtis of Darius, þe peper also,

Thare was þe same tyme a wonder wyse man̛ of werre þe whilke highte

thethyn̛, he come to a reuere, þat es called̛ Stamandra, and þare he said̛
tiƚƚ his men. 'Blyste mote ȝe be', quoþ he, 'þat hase getyn̛

'Me ware leuer,' quoþ he, 'be a wyse manes disciple þan for to hafe þe

suggournede þare wit her a while. And than̛ he ordeyned hym̛ for to wende

þay sperede þe ȝates of þe Citee, and wachede þe citee one ilke a syde.
And when̛ Alexander saw þat, he went & assaillede þe Citee. And þe burgeȝ

þe Citaȝenes opened̛ þe ȝates. Fra thethen̛ þay went to Comnoliche. And

whar þay fande vetails ynoghe, and mete ynoghe for þaire horse. Fra
thethyn̛ þay remoued̛ & come tiƚƚ a place þat hatt Trigagantes, and þare

Alexander ansuered̛, & said̛, 'Now þat þou calleȝ me Hercules,' quoþ he:
'I see wele þat aƚƚ thyn̛ ansuers ere false.' Fra thethyn Alexander went

'Sendeȝ me furthe,' quoþ he, 'foure hundreth knyghtis, wele armed̛ for to

Alexander fra þe citee of Thebe, went to Corynthe, and þare come tiƚƚ

And he graunted̛ þam̛. And to þis Ilke wrestillynge þare come folke

Alexander bad hym ga to. And Clitomarus went into þe place, and þe

And when̛ he herde þis he was righte wrathe wit hir, & saide, 'þou arte

When̛ þe Athenyenes herd̛ þis lettre redd̛, þay ware riȝte gladd̛, and þan̛

Whan he hadd̛ saide on this wise, he gaffe þam̛ leue to gaa whare

When̛ Darius hadd̛ said thir wordeȝ, his broder Coriather

Quod̛ Darius, 'wheþer awe me to take sa ensample at Alexander, or

Tharefore, if it be plesyng vnto ȝow, I conseƚƚ þat ȝe sende tiƚƚ aƚƚ

In this mene tym̛, Alexander sembled̛ a gret multitude of folke to þe

quod þay, 'wete þat oure lorde Alexander be þus seke, he saƚƚ come &

This prynce hade grete envy to þis phicsiene, bicause þat Alexander

In þe mane tyme, þis Phisician come tiƚƚ Alexander wit þe forsaid

'Now for sothe, my lorde,' quoþ he, 'I take oure goddes to witnesse þat

Fra þeine kyng Alexander remowed̛ his Oste tiƚƚ hermony þe mare & onane

In þis mene tyme, kyng Darius gadirde a grete multitude of men̛ agaynes

And Percyene ansuerd̛, & said̛, 'Wiete þou wele wirchipfuƚƚ

And in þe mene tyme, whils Alexander lay at Batran: þare come a prynce

 When̛ Darius had redde þis lettre, on ane he gert writte a lettir to

 Perse we write. Pride & vayne glorie hase oure goddeȝ aƚƚ way hated̛;
 and takeȝ vengeance of dedly men̛ þat takes apon̛ þam̛ þe name of

Þis lettre gaffe Alexander to þe messangers of Darius and many grete
gifteȝ þare wit. Seyme, he sent anoþer lettre, tiƚƚ his prynceȝ & his
lordeȝ, of þis tenour.

 ' Alexander, þe son̛ of Philippe & of þe quene Olympias vnto þe

 Alexsander gerre cary þam̛ to þe water of Eufrates.'

In þis mene tyme a prynce of Darius, Nostande by name, wrate to Darius
on þis wise.

 'To Darius þe wirchipfull grete godd̛ his seruande Nostand̛ law
 seruyce. Me aughte noȝte to sende swylk tythynge to ȝour ryalle

And when̛ Darius had redd̛ þis lettre, he sent in haste tiƚƚ Nostand, and
commanded̛ hym for tiƚƚ ordeyne a grete Oste; and manfully agaynestande
þe folke of Macedoyne. He sent also a lettre to Porus kyng of Ynde,
prayng hym to helpe hym agaynes Alexander, and Porus wrate agayne in þis
manere.

 ' Porus, kyng of Ynde, vnto Darius, kyng of Perse, gretyng. For þou

Bot when̛ Rodogorius, Darius moder, herd̛ teƚƚe þat Darius hir son̛
ordayned̛ hym for to feghte agayne wit kyng Alexander scho was riȝte sory
and wrote a lettre vntiƚƚ hym þat contened̛ this sentence.

 'To kyng Darius, hir moste biloued̛ son, Rodogorius, his modir sendeȝ
 gretyng & ioy. I hafe vnderstanden̛ þat ȝe hafe assemblede ȝour men̛,

 haffe in pesse þan þat at ȝe may halde, þan for too couett aƚƚ and
 be excluded̛ & forga aƚƚ.'

When̛ Darius redde þis lettre, he was gretly troubbled̛ and weped̛
bitterly, command̛ vntiƚƚ his mynde, his moder, his wyf, & his childer.

In the mene tyme kyng Alexander remowed̛ his oste, and drew nere þe cite
of Susis, in þe whilke Darius was lengand̛ the same tyme, so þat he myȝte
see aƚƚ þe heghe hilleȝ þat ware abownn̛ þe citee. Þan Alexander
commanded̛ aƚƚ his men̛, þat ilkan̛ of þam̛ suld cutte down̛e a brawnche of a
tree, and bere þam̛ furth wit þam̛ & dryfe bifore þam̛ aƚƚe manere of
besteȝ þat þay myȝte fynde in þe way. And when the Percyenes saw þam̛ fra
þe heghe hilleȝ þay wondred̛ þam gretly. And Alexander come wit his oste
to þe citee of Susis and luged hym nere besyde þe citee. And than̛ he
called̛ bis prynnceȝ & his oþer lordeȝ and said vnto þam̛, 'Late vs,'
quoþ he, ' send a messangere to kyng Darius & bidd̛ hym̛ owþer & com̛
feghte wit vs or eƚƚs submyt hym vntiƚƚ vs.' The nexte
nyghte after, Godd̛ Amon̛ apperede vntiƚƚ Alexander in his slepe bryngand̛
hym þe figurre of Mercuri & a mantiƚƚ, and anoþer manere of garment of
Macedoyne, and saide vntiƚƚ hym. 'Alexander, son̛,' quoþ hee, 'euer mare
when̛ þou hase nede, saƚƚ I helpe the. And þarefore luke þou sende noghte
to Darius þat messangere þat þou spake off. For I wiƚƚ þat þou thi selfe
clethe thee wit my figure & wende thedir þi selfe; if aƚƚe it be
perilous for to do, Dred þe na thynge, for I saƚƚ be thi helpe, so þat
þou saƚƚ hafe na maner of disesse.

On þe morne when̛ Alexander rase fra slepe, he was gretly comforthed̛ of
his dreme & called tiƚƚ hym his prynceȝ and talde þam̛ alle his dreme,
and þay assentede aƚƚe, þat he schulde wende to Darius in his propir
person. And onane he called̛ vntiƚƚ hym ane of þe princeȝ, þe whilke
highte Emulus. This


 

prynce was a wyghte man̛, & an hardy & wonder trewe tiƚƚ Alexander. And
þan̛ Alexander bad hym lepe one a horse, and brynge wit hym a noþer horse
& folow hym. And he didd̛ so. And when̛ þay come to gedir to þe water of
Graunte, þat in þe langage of Perse es called̛ Struma, þay fande it
frosen̛ ouer, and Alexander onane chaunged he wede, & lefte þe foresaid̛
prynce wit twa horse at þe watersyde and hym selfe, wit þe horse þat he
satt apon̛, went ouer þe water apon̛ þe Ysȝ, towarde þe citee of Susis.
And his prynce besoghte hym þat he walde suffre hym wende wit hym, ne
perauenture any disesse feƚƚe hym by þe waye. And Alexander ansuerd̛ &
sayde, 'Habyde me here,' quoþ he, 'For he saƚƚ be my helpere, wham̛ in
dremeȝ I sawe appere vnto me.' This ilke water I spake of bifore, aƚƚ
þe wynter seson ilke a nyghte was frosen̛ aƚƚ ouer; bot tymely in þe
mornynge als sone als þe warme son̛ smate apon̛ it, þan̛ it dissoluede
agayne, & ran̛ wonder swiftely; þe brede of þat water es þe space of a
furlange. When Alexander come to þe ȝate of þe citee the Perciens, when
þay saw hym, hadd̛ grete wonder of his figure, and wend̛ he hadd̛ bene a
godd̛, and onane þay asked̛ hym what he was ? And he ansuerd̛ and said̛ he
was a messangere sent fra kyng Alexander to þaire lorde Darius, and belyfe þay broghte hym til hym. Darius, when Alexander come bi fore hym,
said vntil hym. 'Whethyn̛ ert þou,' quoþ he ? 'I ame,' quoþ Alexander,
'sent vnto þe fra kyng Alexander to wiete where to þou taries to come
tiƚƚ hymu to gyffe hym bateƚƚe. Owthir come & feghte manfully wit thyne
enemys or eƚƚs submitte þe tiƚƚ hym̛ & pay hym tribute.'

And Darius heard him and said, ' Art thou then the Alexander who with
such madness shaped thy speech, for I see thou holdest thyself not from
words as a messenger doth, but art bold as a king. Yet know that by thy
words I am not frightened at all. Come dine with me this day.' And with
these words, he reached out his hand to him and took him by his right,
and led him into the palace. And Alexander, musing, began to say: 'A
right good token hath this barbarian wrought me when he clasped my right
hand and drew me into 


 

the palace, because, as the gods say sooth, ere long the palace shall be
mine.' And going in, Darius and Alexander lay by a table, and the
daintiest feast was laid out. And Darius' marshall gazed hard at
Alexander face to face. And the table was wreathed in cleanest gold. But
the Persians, seeing Alexander's shape, yet knew nothing of what wisdom,
doughtiness, and strength lurked in this small body. The dishes and
tables and seats were wrought of the finest gold. The cupbearers bore
cups in golden vessels and rarest jewels. And when a cup was handed to
Alexander, he hid it in his breast. And another cup was brought to him
and he did the same, and thus too with a third. And those who bore the
cups, seeing this, gave the news to the Emperor Darius. And he, hearing
of it, rose up; saying: 'Friend, what is this that thou doest, hiding
the cups in thy breast?' And Alexander: 'In our king's feasts the guests
are wont, whenever they will, to take their drinkingvessels. But, as
this seemeth to you unworthy, I will give them back forthwith.' And with
these words he gave them back to the cupbearers. But the Persians who
sate at the feast said each to each, 'a good custom, indeed, and one to
be praised.' And some lords, too, praised this way and exalted it. But
one of the Princes of Darius, called Anapolus, sitting at the feast,
gazed hard at Alexander and his face. For he had seen him when, at
Darius' bidding, he went into Macedonia to take tribute of Philip. He,
knowing his voice and looking on his face, began to think to himself and
say: 'Is this not Alexander?' And rising at once he drew near to Darius,
saying: 'This messenger whom thou beholdest is Alexander, the son of
Philip of Macedon.' And Alexander, seeing them with each other in talk,
knew they were speaking of him and he was known. And at this he rose up
from his place and leapt away from the board. And taking a blazing torch
from a Persian's hand, himself mounted his palfrey, which he found ready
outside Darius's palace, and fled in the swiftest flight. And the
Persian seeing this, taking weapons, mounted their steeds with a mighty
stir, and quickly followed after Alexander. And in the darkness of the
nightfall, they began to stray, some scratched their faces by the treeboughs, some falling into ditches. But Alexander, bearing his blazing
torch in hand, fared straight 


 

forward. Now, Darius sate on his throne and thought of Alexander and how
great his daring was. He saw a statue of gold of Xerxes the Persian
king, who sate below the highseat in the hall. And at once the statue
broke and was all scattered asunder. And Darius seeing this was smitten
with heaviness of heart and began to weep sorely and long. And he said:
'This foretokeneth the wasting of my life, and the utter downfall of the
Persian kingdom.' Alexander, however, coming to the river Grancus, found
it swollen, and leapt athwart it. But ere he was over the stream burst
its banks, and swept his horse away; with great hardship Alexander
escaped and met Eumulus, his lord. And thus he went back to his army and
told them of Darius, how he had dealt with him, and the torch with which
he had fled away. 


 HOW ALEXANDER PUT HEART INTO HIS HOST ANEW.

And on the following day, he gathered his army, which told two hundred
and twenty thousand of weaponed men. And he went up 

 on a hye place & comforthed his men̛ and said̛ vnto þam̛: 'Þe
multitude of þe percienes,' quoþ he, 'may noȝte be euend to þe multitude
of þe greckes. For sewrly we are ma þan þay. And if þay were ane
hundreth sythes maa then̛ wee, late noȝte ȝour hertis faile ȝow þarefore.
For I telle ȝow a grete multitude of flyes may do na harme till a fewee
waspes.' And when̛ þe Oste had herde thire wordes þay commendide hym
halelely wit a voyce.

Than̛ þe emperour Darius remowed̛ his oste, and come to þe reuere of
Graunt on þe nyghte, and went ouer on þe ysȝ, and þar he luged̛ hym. The
Oste of Darius was wonder grete and strange. For þay hadd̛ in þaire oste
X^m cartes ordaynd̛ For þe werre, and grete multitude of Olyfanteȝ, wit
towres of tree on̛ þam̛, stuffed̛ wit feghtyng men̛. And sone after appon̛ a
day thir twa kynges wit þaire osteȝ mett samen̛ on a faire felde, Darius
wit his men̛, and Alexander wit his men.


 

Than Alexender lept apon̛ his horse, þat highte Buctiphalas, and rade
furthe bifore aƚƚ his oste, and houed in þe myddes waye bitwene þe twa
ostes. And when̛ þe Percyenes saw hym, þa had grete wonder of hym, and
ware riȝte ferde for hym, by cause he was so vggly. Neuereþelesse þay
tromped̛ vp & went towarde Alexander. And sone þe bateƚƚ ioyned, &
faghte togedir fersely, and many men̛ dyed̛ on ayther party; þare was so
thikke schott of arowes, þat þe ayer was couerde, as it had bene wit a
clowde. Some faghte wit swerdeȝ, sum wit speres, sum wit axes, & sum̛ wit
arowes. Þe felde lay fuƚƚ of folke, sum̛ dede, sum̛ halfedede, & sum̛
greuously wonded̛. Thay began̛ for to feghte at þe son̛rysynge, and faghte
to þe son̛settyng. Bot þare dyed̛ many ma of þe percyenes þan þare dide
of Macedoyns.

And when̛ Darius sawe his men̛ faƚƚe so thikke in þe felde, he lefte þe
felde, and fledd, and þe percyenes seyng that, þay fledd̛ also. Bot þan̛
þaire cartes of werre rane amange þe percyens & slewe of þam̛ folke witowte nouwmer & namely of fotemen̛. For by þat tyme it was myrke nyghte,
and þay ne myȝte noȝte see for tiƚƚ eschewe þam̛. When̛ Darius come to the foresaid̛ watere he fande it frosen̛, and ouer he went. And
when̛ he was ouer, þe oþer lordes of perse went appon̛ þe ysȝ, so grete a
multitude þat þay couerde þe ysȝ fra þe taa banke to þe toþer, & þat a
grete brede, & þan̛ onane þe ysȝ brake als sone als Darius was paste
ouer, & aƚƚ þat ware on þe ysȝ ware perischte, ilk a moder son̛, &
drownede in þe water. Þe remanaunt, when̛ þay come to the water, þay
myȝte noȝte wyn̛ ouer. And þan̛ þe Macedoynes come, & dange þam̛ downe. In
this bateƚƚe þare was slaen of þe percyenes CCC^m witowten̛ thase þat
were drownned.

Kyng Darius fledd̛ to þe citee of Susis, & went in tiƚƚ his palace, &
feƚƚe downe to þe grounde, & sigheand & wepande wit a sare hert, he said̛
theis wordes: 'Allas, fuƚƚ wa es me, vnhappye wriche, þat euer I was
borne, for þe ire & þe indignacionn̛ of heuen̛ es fallen̛ one mee. For I
Darius þat lifte my seluen̛ vp to þe sternes, Now am I broghte lawe to þe

subiecte & tributaries vntiƚƚ hym, fayne for to flee fra his enemys and
submytte hym vnto þam̛. And it ware


 

knawen̛ vnto þe wreched man̛, what schulde falle tiƚƚ hym afterwardeȝ,
he schulde hafe littiƚƚ thoghte of þe tyme presentt, bot one þe tyme to
come solde his thoȝte be. In a poynte of a daye it falles, þat þe meke
es raysede vp to þe clowddeȝ, and þe prowde es putt to noȝte.' And when̛
he hade saide thir wordes, he rase vp, & satt & wrate a lettre vntill
Alexander, sayande on this wyese.

 'Tiƚƚ his lorde Alexander, kyng of Macedoyne, Darius, kyng of Perse,
 gretyng & Joy. We hafe wele vndirstanden by þat that we hafe herde

 treasures we have in Aydem and Susa and Batram, the which our
 fathers hoarded and hid in earthen cellars. And we will give you the
 kingsbip of the Medes and Persians, that thus ye may have and keep
 what victory Jove the allmighty hath granted you.'


 


 HOW THE MESSENGERS OF DARIUS GAVE ALEXANDER THE LETTER, AND HIS
 ANSWER.

The messengers of Darius coming then to Alexander gave him the letter,
which Alexander read soon before them all. Then one of his chieftains,
called Parmerion, said to Alexander: 'Most mighty emperor, take all the
wealth which Darius covenants unto thee, and give back to him his wife
and sons.' And, hearing this, Alexander called to him the messengers of
Darius, and before all spoke thus, saying: 'Tell ye to your emperor we
wonder first that he misdeemed his mother, wife, and sons to be betrayed
by our hands. If he be overcome, bid him not promise us a reward. If he
bow himself to our yoke, all his honours and the majesty of God shall be
laid bare to our sway. If he be not overcome, let him do us battle once
again.' This said, he gave them rich gifts and sent them forth away.
Then he bade the soldiers take up and gather the bodies of the dead and
bury them in graves: and he bade them heal those that were wounded.



 HOW ALEXANDER ENCAMPED BY THE STREAM GRANCUS.

Then he encamped with his host by the stream of Grancus, and wintered
there some days. And there he offered up victims to the gods. And about
the river there were palaces, and they were the fairest, raised up with
greatest skill, and Xerxes the King of the Persians had built them.
Alexander, seeing them, bade them be burned. And soon after this,
stirred by ruth, he gave word none should dare touch them. And there too
was a most fair and very wide field in which the Kings and Deemsters of
Persia were of old buried. And digging into this field the Macedonians
found in the graves gemmed vases. And there they found the grave of
Ninus the King of Assyria and Persia, which was hollowed out of a single
amethyst, and engraven on the outside with palmleaves and sundry kinds
of birds. And so bright was the amethyst that even from the outside the
man's body appeared whole. And in this place was a narrow and evil tower
on which stood many men, some with cut legs, some with broken thighs,
some with torn hands, and some blinded. They hearing 


 

the noise of the armed men cried out to Alexander, who bearing their
cries, bade them be taken thence. And seeing them was struck with ruth
and wept, and bade each one be given ten thousand drachmas, and be
restored every one to his own. For Darius kept them in prison, since
they were of noble birth, and awarded all their possessions to his
thralls. In the meantime the messengers from Alexander to Darius told
all that Alexander had said. And Darius hearing this began to get ready
for the fight. And he wrote another letter to Porus King of India, which
runneth as follows: 

THE LETTER SENT BY DARIUS TO PORUS KING OF INDIA.

'Darius King of the Persians to Porus King of Our Indians joy. We asked
but lately of you, and again we ask you to come and help against those
who strive to overthrow our palace. We know well also that the like harm
will light on you. For this Alexander, who fighteth thus, hath an
unquenchable and wild soul, which like a lion ceaseth not, and is like
the sea when stirred by mighty winds. Furthermore, unwillingly though it
be, we have gathered numberless races, and we have taken our counsel to
fight with him to the very death. better vs es for

in tyme commynge for to do to ȝowe.'

In the men tyme, certane men̛ of Darius went fra hym & come tiƚƚ
Alexander, & talde hym, þat Darius purposede hym for to feghte wit hym
eftesones, and had sent tiƚƚ Porus, kyng of Inde, for to come in grete
haste, for to helpe hym. When̛ Alexander herd þis, belyfe he remowed̛ his
Oste to ward̛ Darius, thynkand in his herte þat he wolde on na wyse take
apon̛ hym þe name of Emperour before he hadd̛ wonn̛ Darius and his rewme
one werre. And when Darius herde of þe commyng of Alexander, he dredd̛
hym gretly & þe percyenes also. Bot þare was two prynceȝ of Darius, of
þe whilke þe tane highte Bisso & þe toþer Ariobarsantes, thir twa when̛
þair herd̛ of þe comyng of Alexander, conspyred̛ togedir for to slaa þaire
lord̛ Darius, supposyng for tiƚƚ hafe a grete thanke of Alexander, and a
gret reward̛ for þaire dede. And ayther of þam̛ ware sworne tiƚƚ oþer. And
than̛ thay went to þe kynges palace, and come intiƚƚ his chamber wit
drawen̛ swerdes in þaire handeȝ, and fand Darius bi hym ane. And when̛
Darius saw that, he trowed̛ wele þat þay wolde sla hym̛, And said vnto
þam̛: 'Dere frendeȝ, hedir to wardeȝ hafe I called ȝow my seruaundeȝ, bot
now I call ȝow my lordes. What ayles ȝow at me þat ȝe wiƚƚ sla me ? Haes
Alexander cheriste þe macedoynes mare þan̛ I hafe done ȝow? Hafe I noȝte

mercy, thurgℏ his wordeȝ, Bot went tiƚƚ ℏym and wit grete cruelnesse
smate hym, & alto magle hym, and went faste þaire waye, & lefte hym for

And when̛ Alexander herd̛ teƚƚ þat Darius was slayne he


 

went ouer þe water of Graunt, and aƚƚ his Oste wit hym, and come to þe
cetee of Susis. And alsone als þe percyenes saw hym, Thay Opened þe
ȝates of þe citee, & rescheyued̛ hym̛ wit grete wirchipe. And when̛ þe
prynceȝ þat slewe Darius wiste þat Alexander was comen̛ in̛to þe citee
þay went & helde þam̛ in hidils ay tiƚƚ þay myȝte gete knaweynge of
Alexander wiƚƚ, as towchand̛ þat that þay hadd̛ done to Darius. Alexander
þan̛ went into þe kynges Palace, and as he went þarein he merueyled hym
gretly of þe biggyng þareoff. For Cirus þe kyng of Perse gert bigg it
ryally. And the pament þareoffe was made of stanes of dyuerse colours, &
þe walles aƚƚ enueround wit fyne golde & precyous stanes & sternes lyke
to þe firmament, and pelers of golde þat bare vp þe werke. When̛
Alexander saw aƚƚ this curious werke, he meruailed̛ hym gretly. And than̛
he went to þe chambre þare Darius laye halfe dede. And alsone als he saw

and layde his arme abowte Alexander nekke, and kyssed his breste, his

swelt in Alexander armes. Kyng Alexander, þan̛, after þe custom̛ was for

wit aƚƚ þe solempnyte and wirchipe þat myghte be done, he helped hym

noȝte allanly for þe dede of Darius, bot for petee of þaire hertis, þat
þay saw Alexander wepe so enterely. And when̛ Darius was beried̛ Alexander
went agayne to þe palace.

And one þe morne Alexander went and sett hym in a trone aƚƚ of golde &

of precious stanes, & ofþe sege þareoffe was vii seuen̛ cubeteȝ heghe
fra þe grounde, and a grece of seuen̛ greeȝ was made


 

þareto, whareby kynges ascended þareto. And thir greeȝ were mede
wonder craftyly & curyously. The firste gree was of ane amatist. The
seconde gree was of a Smaragd̛. The thredd̛ gree was of a Topaȝ. The
ferthe gree was of a granat. The fifte was of ane adamand̛. The sext was
of fyn̛ golde. And the seuennt was of clay. And thay ware noȝt wtten̛ grete causeȝ ordeyned̛ one þis wyse.

For þe first gree wne amatist, for amange aƚƚ oþer stanes it hase
this vertu, that it represses & haldeȝ donne þe fumositee of wyne & þe
myghte þareoffe, & suffers noȝte a man̛ þat bere it on̛ hym be troubbled̛

solde ilke a kyng be of perfite witt & mynde, & thurgℏ nane occasion̛ do

þe sighte of hym þat beres apon̛ hym, and so schulde a kynge hafe
clere sighte of his hert, wysely for to see & discerne that þat es
spedfull & profitable bathe for hym selfe & for þe comon̛ profit. The
thirdd̛ gree was of a Topaȝ, þe whilke es so clere, þat & a man̛ bihalde
hym selfe þarein, it saƚƚ seme tiƚƚ hym, as his hede ware tournede
downwardeȝ, and his fete vpwardeȝ; And it betakenes þat a kyng schulde

whilk passeȝ aƚƚ manere of precious stanes in reedness: & betakens þat a

The fifte was of ane Adamande. Þe Adamande es so harde þat it may noȝte
be broken̛ nowþer with yren̛ ne wit stane, bot if it firste be enoynted̛
wit gayte blode. On þe same wyse a kyng suld be of so grete constance &

riȝte as gold̛ passeȝ all maner of metaƚƚe in bewtee, & in precioustee;
riȝte so a kyng awe to be preferred̛ before oþer men̛ & gouernours of þam̛.
 Þe seuent was of Clay, tiƚƚ þat entent þat a man̛ þat es
raysed vp to þe dingnyte of a kyng sulde alway vmbythynk hym þat he was
made of erthe, & at þe laste


 

to þe erthe he saƚƚ agayne. When̛ Alexander was sett apon̛ this trone,
coronnde wit his diademe, & þe Macedoynes & þe persenes standyng abowte
hym: before þam̛ aƚƚe he gert write a lettre tiƚƚ aƚƚ cuntreeȝ, þat was
of this tenour.

 'Alexander the son̛ of godd̛ Amon̛ & qwene Olympias kyng of kynges &
 lorde of lordes, tiƚƚ aƚƚe Dukes, Prynceȝ, Erles, Baronns, maisters,
 & tiƚƚ aƚƚ þe folkeȝ of Perse: ioy & grace. Sen̛ it es plesynge to
 godd, þat I sitt one þe trone of Darius, & be lorde of þe persyenes,
 grete cause I hafe for to be reioyist gretely þareoffe, ne were it
 for þe gret multitude of folke þat ere slayne. Bot sen̛ it so es þat
 godd̛ hase ordeynede me to be ȝour lorde, and ȝour gouernour, þare fore we commande ȝow þat in ilke a citee, thurghowte þe lordchipe of
 Perse, ȝe ordeyne prynceȝ and gouernours as þare was in Darius tyme,
 to þe whilke we commande ȝow þat ȝe be obeyande as ȝe beforetymes
 hafe bene, and that þay do riȝte tiƚƚ ilke a man̛ at þaire powere.
 Also it es oure wiƚƚ and oure commandement, þat ilke a man̛ welde &
 reioyse paysabily his landes and his possessiouns. We commande
 alsoo, þat fra this lande of perse vntiƚƚ Ellada, & fra thethyn̛ to
 Macedoyne, be redy way & open̛ so þat ilke a man̛ þat wiƚƚ may passe
 bathe in and owte, wit merchandyse or any oþer erandes þat þay hafe
 at do, and Joy & pese be vnto ȝowe.'

Þan gert Alexander aƚƚ men̛ be stiƚƚ, and said one this wyse: 'Whilke of
ȝow so slew myn̛ enemy Darius; comeȝ forthe befor me, and I shaƚƚ giffe
ȝow worthy mede, & conable wirchipe do þam̛, I swere bi oure goddeȝ þat
ere Almyȝty, & bi my moste biloved̛ moder Olympias, þat I saƚƚ gyffe þam̛
worthy mede.' When̛ Alexander had saide thir wordes þe persyenes wepede
wonderly sare. And than̛ þe twa man̛morthireres Bisso and Aryobarȝantes
come bifore Alexander, and sayde vntiƚƚ hym: 'Wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,'
quoþ þay, 'we ere thase þat slew Darius thyne enemy wit oure Awenn̛
hende.' And when̛ Alexander saw þam̛, he bade his knyghtes belyfe ga &
take þam̛, & bynde þam, & lede þam̛ to Darius grafe, & þare smyte
of þaire heuedes, And than̛ þay ansuerd̛, & saide vntiƚƚ Alexander: 'A,
A, wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,' quoþ þay,


 

'swore þou noȝte tiƚƚ vs, bi oure goddeȝ þat ere Almyȝty, & bi þe hele
of thi moder Olympias, þat þou solde gerre do vs na harme, bot þat þou
solde giff vs a worthi reward̛.' And Alexander saide agayne vnto þam̛:
'So aughte me wele for to swere, for to gette knawyng of þe slaers of
Darius. For I solde neuer hafe getyn̛ knawyng þareoffe had I noȝte
sworne so. And ȝitt I saƚƚ safe myn̛ athe wele ynoghe. For it was alway
myn̛ entent, þat if I myȝte wete what þay ware, þay solde hafe swilke a
rewarde. For þay þat slaes þaire awenn̛ lorde it es a taken̛ þat þay wiƚƚ
hafe na conscience to sla anoþer man̛.' And when þe perseyenes herde this
þay bygan̛ to prayse Alexander & to commende hym and blysse hym as he
had bene a godd̛. Þan̛ kyng Alexander gert hede tha twa homycydes. And aƚƚ
þe rewme he sett in gouernance of certayne lordes. Amanges oþer þare was
ane alde lorde was eme to Darius, þe whilke highte Climitus, þat was
gretly luffede wit þe persyenes; And Alexander at þe request of aƚƚ the
persyenes ordeyned hym for to be chefe goueruour vnder hym of aƚƚ perse.
And one þe morne Alexander sett hym in his trone, wit his coroun̛ on his
hede, and efter þe biddynng of Darius he commande to brynge bifore hym
Rosan̛, Darius doghter, wit a coroun̛ on̛ hir hede, sett fuƚƚ of precious
stanes. And þare, as þe maner was of þe persyenes, he tuke hir to his
wyfe, and made hir to sitt wit hym in his trone & command aƚƚ men̛ to
wirchipe hir als quene. And þan̛ þe persyenes were wonderly glade, &
onane þay broȝte þaire goddeȝ bifore Alexander, and bigan̛ to wirchipe
hym, & loue hym riȝte als he hade bene a godd̛, and said̛ vntill hym,
hallely wit a voyce, 'þou thi selfe es a godd̛, For that þat es plesande
tiƚƚ oure goddes alway þou dose.' And when̛ Alexander saw this, he was
gretly troubled & riȝte ferde & said̛ vnto þam 'Wirchipfuƚƚ sirs,' quoþ
he, 'I pray ȝow þat ȝe wirchipe me noȝte as a godd̛, for sothely I am as
ȝe are, a corupteble & a dedly man̛, and in me þare es na parceƚƚ of the
godhede. And þarefore, I beseke ȝow, cesseȝ of this wirchipe þat ȝe do me'

Þan gert Alexander write a lettre tiƚƚ Olympias his moder & tiƚƚ
Arestotle his maister, makand mencyon̛ of aƚƚ þe batayƚƚs & þe disesseȝ
þat he hadd̛ suffred in Perse, and of þe grete reches


 

þat he fande þare, of þe whilke he & aƚƚ his men̛ ware made riche. And
also he wrate vnto þam̛, þat þay scholde make grete
solempnytee lastyng aghte dayes because of þe weddynge of Alexander &
Rosan̛ Darius doghter. And so did̛ Alexander, in Perse, wit þe maceydoynes
& þe persyenes, many a daye.

Affter this kyng Alexander sembled̛ a grete Oste, bathe of macedoyns & of
persyenes, and went towarde Inde for to werre apon̛ Porus, kyng of Inde,
þe whilke ordeynede hym for to come & helpe kyng Darius. And, when
Alexander was entered intiƚƚ Inde, he went thurgℏ wildernes & waste
cuntree, whare in ware grete reuers and many grete caues & cauernes. And
þan̛ Alexander & his men̛ wex wery, & irkede riȝte sare. And þe prynces Of
macedoyne & of grece murmourede amangeȝ þam̛ gretly, & saide ilkan̛ tiƚƚ
oþer: 'It myȝte hafe sufficed̛ tiƚƚ vs, þat we hafe ouersett kyng
Darius, & conqerred̛ þe kyngdom̛ of Perse. Wherebe seke we forthire intiƚƚ Inde, þe whilke es fuƚƚ of wilde besteȝ, and leues oure awenn̛

For werre & debate unrescheȝ his body so fer furth þat, and he ristede
any lange tyme witowten̛ werre, riȝte als it were for defaute of mete he
schulde faile & dye. Leue we hym þarefore, and turne we agayne vntiƚƚ
oure awenn̛ cuntree, and late hym wende furthe wit the persyenes, if he

went and stodde in ane heghe place amangeȝ þam̛, & sayde one this wise:
'Departis ȝow in twaa, so þat þe persyenes be by þam̛selfe and þe
Macedoynes and þe grekes bi þam̛selfe.' And when̛ þay hadd̛ so done,
Alexander saide to þe Macedoynes and þe grekes: 'A A, myne owenn̛ dere
knyghtis,' quoþ he, 'wele knawe þat thir persyenes, vnto þis day,
hase bene contrary & rebeƚƚes vnto ȝow & to me, and ȝe wiƚƚ now lefe me

when ȝour hertes were troubblede, & fered, for þe wordes þat ware

And I by myn̛ ane was þe firste man̛ þat entrede þe batayƚe. And ȝitt
moreouer, as ȝe wele wate, I tuke apon̛ me for to be ȝoure allere
messangere vnto kynge Darius. And þare, for ȝow, I putt my selfe in
many grete periƚƚs. And þarefore, witteȝ wele for certayne,

þarefore I say ȝow forsothe, þat, aƚƚ if ȝe will tourne agayne to grece

When̛ Alexander had said̛ þus, aƚƚ þe prynceȝ of Macedoyne and of þe
grekes schamede gretely, and askede mercy & forgifnesse, sayande one
this wyse: 'Moste wirchipfuƚƚ emperour, oure lyfe lyes hallely in ȝour

cuntree of Inde þat es called̛ Phisiacen̛, in þe laste ende of July. And
þare mette hym þe embassatours of Porus kyng of Inde, and broghte hym

 ' Porus kyng of Inde: vnto þe theeffe Alexander, þat thurgℏ thifte

When̛ þis lettre was comen̛ tiƚƚ Alexander, he gerte rede it before aƚƚ

When̛ Porus hadd̛ this lettre, he was wondere wrathe & assemblede a grete

Þe hauƚƚ, also, of þis Palace, was sett fuƚƚ of ymages of golde, & bitwix þam̛ stode perlatanes of golde, in þe branches of whilke þare were

Fra thethyn̛, Alexander remowede his Oste & come to þe ȝates of Caspee,
and þare he luged̛ hym̛. It was a noble lande & a gude. Bot þare ware
þareIn many maners of nedders and of wilde besteȝ. Fra þeine
Alexander sent a lettre tiƚƚ Talifride quene of Amaȝon̛, of þis tenour.

 ' Kyng of kynges, and lorde of lordes, Alexander, þe son̛ of godd̛

And vnto this lettre Talifride made ansuere by lettre one this wyse.

When̛ Alexander hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, he began̛ to lawghe. And onane he
garte writte anoþer lettre, and sent it to Talyfride, whareoffe þe

 'Alexander kyng of kynges and of lordeȝ, the son̛ of godd̛ Amon̛ & þe

And when̛ þe Amaȝons hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, þay went to conseƚƚ, and
thoghte it was beste for to ascent vntiƚƚ hym. And þan̛ þay sent hym x

selfe and oþer ladys wit hir went untiƚƚ hym̛, and accorded̛ wit hym, and
went hame agayne, wonder glade and blythe.

In þe mene tyme it was talde Alexander, þat Porus, þe kyng of Inde, was
in Bactricen̛, and assembled̛ a grete Oste for to feghte eftsonns wit hym.
And when̛ Alexander herde this, he remowede his Oste, and chese owte c.l
of duyercs þat knewe þe cuntree, for to hafe þe gouernance of his Oste,
and to lede þam̛ seurly thurgh þat strange cuntree. In þe Monethe of
Auguste, when̛ þe son̛ es maste hate, þay bigan̛ for to take þaire iournee.
And thay went thurgℏ a dry cuntree, sandye, & witowtten̛ water. And
nedlyngeȝ þam̛ byhoued̛ wende armede, þare was so grete plentee of

fauorable to Porus, þan̛ tiƚƚ Alexander & his Oste, and þarefore þay
ledd̛ þam̛ thurgh swilke barrayne and perilous cuntreeȝ. And when̛
Alexander saw it schope thus, and that his conseƚƚ byfore had sayd þe

conseld̛ hym þat he suld noȝte hye hym ouerfaste, ne triste to mekiƚƚ to

did̛. And þan̛ aƚƚ þe Oste schane riȝte as it had̛ bene sternes, for sum of
þaire armours ware of golde, sum̛ of siluer, and sum̛ of precious stanes.
And when̛ Alexander saw þe araye of his Oste, and þaire baners bifore
þam̛ Schynande so faire, he was riȝte gladde. Neuerþeles grete disese
he hadd̛, þat nowþer he, ne his men̛, myȝte fynde na water.


 

So it feƚƚe þat a knyghte of Macedoyne þat hyȝte ȝephilus fand̛ water
standynge in an holle stane, þat was gadird̛ þare of þe dewe of þe heuen̛,
the whilke þis forsaide knyghte putt in his Bacenett, & broȝthe it till
Alexander for to drynke. And Alexander saide untiƚƚ hym, 'I suppose,'
quoþ he, 'þat I drynke þis water, saƚƚ þe Macedoynes & þe persyenes be
any thynge refreschede þareby, or I saƚƚ hafe aƚƚ þe refreschyng be my

comforthed þareby.' Quoþ Alexander þan̛, 'And̛ if ȝe saƚƚ aƚƚ
perische trowes þou þat it solde be lykand̛ to mee, for to lyfe in sorowe
& disese seynge þe dedd̛ of þe Macedoynes & þe persyenes ?' And belyue
he garte heƚƚe downn̛ þe water on þe erthe before aƚƚ his men̛. And when̛
his knyghtis saw that, þay were hugely comforthede þareby riȝte als
Ilkan̛ of þam̛ hadd̛ dronken̛ a grete draughte of water, and þan̛ went furthe
þaire waye. And on̛ þe morne, þay come tiƚƚ a reuere whase bankes was
growand̛ fuƚƚ of grete redys & þay ware als hye as pynetreese; ȝa, for
þe maste partie of xƚ fote lange. Than badd̛ that þay drawe of þe
water and brynge to þe Oste. Bot aƚƚ þat dranke þareoffe it keste þam̛
intiƚƚ a flux, and slewe a grete hepe of þam. For þat water was wonder
scharpe, and als bittire als any mekiƚƚ gyrse. Bot þan̛ was Alexander
gretly disessedd̛ & aƚƚ his Oste noȝte allanly of þam̛selfe, bot also for
þaire horseȝ & þaire besteȝ þat þay ledd̛ wit þam̛ þe whilke bigan̛ for to

He hadd̛ also in his Oste ccc^m horse men̛ and muyles & camelles witowten̛

þe Oste; also oxen̛ and kye, schepe and swyne, witowten̛ nowmer, þe
whilke perischt for defaute of drynke. Sum̛ of Alexander knyghtes lykked̛

grete nuy to þam & an̛ heghe disese. Þan̛ was Alexander wonder sorye &
namely for þe disese þat his Oste suffrede.


 

And̛ as þay went endlande þis reuere, abowte þe viii houre of þe day, þay
come tiƚƚ a casteƚƚ þat stode in a littiƚƚ Ile in þis forsaid̛ ryuere;
Aud this casteƚƚ was made of þe forsaid̛ redeȝ. Þe brede of this ryuer
was foure furlange lentℏ. And in þat casteƚƚ þay sawe a few men̛. And þan̛
Alexander bad his men̛ spirre þam̛ þat ware in þe casteƚƚ in þe langage of
Inde whare þay myghte fynde any swete watir able for to drynke. And also
son̛ als þay spake to þam̛ þay withdrewe þam̛ & hidd̛. And Alexander gerte
schotte arowes into þe casteƚƚ and þan̛ þay hidd̛ þam̛ wele þe mare. And
when Alexander saw that þay walde one na wyse speke wit hym, he
hadd̛ a certane of his knyghtes nakne þam & swyme ouer þe water to þe
casteƚƚ. And þan̛ xxxvii balde knyghtis & hardy of Macedoyne nakned̛ þam̛,
and tuke ilkan̛ of þam̛ a swerde in his hande & went into þe water &
swame it to þay were passede þe fertbe parte þareoffe. And sodeynly
thare rase oute of þe water a grete multitude of besteȝ, þat ere called̛
ypotaynes, grettere of body than̛ an̛ olypℏant, and deuored̛ thir knyghtis
euerilkanne. And þan̛ was Alexander riȝte sare greuede, and belyfe
garte take þe forsaid̛ guydeȝ cl & caste þam̛ into þe water. And onane þe
ypotaynes deuored̛ þem.

And Alexander thoghte it was noȝte spedfuƚƚ langare to stryffe wit thase
monstres, and garte tromppe vp and remowed̛ his Oste fra þeine, and went
so aƚƚ þat day wondere wery for thriste. And also þay hadd̛ grete disese
& nuye of wilde Beste þat come apon̛ þam̛, þat es to say, of lyones,
beres, vnycornes, tygres, and pardeȝ, wit þe whilke þay faughte & grete
traueƚƚ hade.

And as þay went on̛ þis wyse wit grete angere & disese aboute þe elleued̛
houre þay saw a littiƚƚ bate in þe riuere made of rede and men̛ rowande
þarein. And Alexander gert spirre þam̛ in þe langage of Inde, whare þay
myȝte fynde any fresche water. And þay talde whare & schewed̛ þam̛ a place
a littiƚƚ þeine wharein þay saide þay scholde fynde a grete staunke of
swete water and gude. And þan̛ Alexander & hys Oste went aƚƚ aboute þat

Alexander comanded̛ þat þay sulde feƚƚe


 

a wodd̛ þat growed̛ faste þareby three myle on lenthe, & aƚƚs mekiƚƚ on

stanke was a myle on̛ lentℏ. Þan̛ Alexander comanded̛ þat þay sulde make
many fires in þe Oste, and gerte trompe to þe mete. Ald alson̛ þe mone
began̛ to schynne þare come a grete multitude of scorpyons towarde þe
stanke for to take þam̛ a drynke. And þan̛ þare come oþer manere of
nedders, and dragones wonder grete of dyuerse colours. And aƚƚ þat
cuntree resounned̛ of þe noyse & þe hissȝingeȝ þat þay made. Þir dragones
come dounne fra þe hye mountaynes for to drynke of þe stanke, and þay
hadd̛ crestis one þaire heddeȝ & þaire bresteȝ ware bryghte lyk golde, &
þaire mowthes open̛. Þaire aande slewe any qwikk thynge þat it smate

Alexander & his Oste saw þam̛ þay ware riȝt fered̛ for þam̛.
For þay wende þay schulde hafe weried̛ þam̛ ilkan̛. And þan̛ Alexander
comforthed̛ þam̛ and saide vnto þam̛: 'Mi wirchipfuƚƚ knyghtes,' quoþ he,
'bees noȝte agaste of þam̛, bot does ilkane as ȝe see me do.' And þan̛ he
tuk a nett & sett it bitwixe hym & þam̛ and tuke his schelde & his spere

gretly comforthed̛ & belyfe tuke þaire wapynneȝ & didd̛ als þay sawe
Alexander doo, and slewe of þam̛ a grete multitude, whatt thurgℏ dyuerse

nettis & slewe many of þam̛. And on þis wyse Alexander & his Oste was
gretly disesed. Þan̛ comanded̛ Alexander þat þay schuld̛ make many fyres
witowtten̛ þe Oste abonte þe stanke. After this þare come apon̛ þam̛ a
wondere grete beste, grettere & strangere þan̛ an̛ Olyphaunt, and he hadde
in his frunte three lange hornes. And he was schapen̛ lyke a horse & he
was aƚƚ blakke. And þis beste was called̛ in þe langage of Inde
'Anddontrucion̛'. And or he went to þe water at drynke, he assailled̛ þe
Oste. Bot Alexander went here & þare amangeȝ þe oste & comforthed̛ þam̛.
This ilke beste slewe of his knyghtes xxviij and bare donne lij and at
þe laste it feƚƚe in þe nettis and was slayne. After þis þare come oute

Of sum̛ þay bate offe þe nese; of sum þe eres. In þe mornenynge arely
þare come many fewlis als grete as wlturs, reed̛ of colour, and þaire

went to þe stankesyde & drewe fisches & eleȝ oute of þe water, & ete þam̛.

Þhan̛ lefte Alexander þir perilous placeȝ, and come wit his Oste, into
þe cuntree of Bactricen̛, þe whilke was fuƚƚ of golde & oþer reches. And
þe men̛ of þe cuntree resayfed̛ hym benyngly & wirchipfully and gaffe hym
and his Oste grete giftes. And þare he habade xx^ti dayes. In þat
cuntree þay sawe trees þat, instedde of leues, bare woƚƚe; þe whilke
folkeȝ of þe cuntree gaderd̛ & made clathe þareoffe. Þe knyghtes of
Alexander wex wonder balde & strange of hert because of þe victoryes þay

Fra thethyn, Alexander remowed̛ his Oste and come to þe place whare Porus
lay wit þe folke þat he hadd̛ assembled̛. And one þe morne bathe Alexander
and Porus tuke þaire grounde & arayed̛ þaire bateƚƚs for to feghte. And than̛


 

Alexander lepped apon̛ his horse Buktiphalas and went bifore his Oste &
þan̛ þay trumpede up & þe bateƚƚs joyned̛ samen̛, & faghte togedir riȝte
sare. Bot þe Indienes feƚƚ thikfalde in þe bateƚƚ as corne dose in þe

sitteȝ noȝte tiƚƚ an emperour,' quoþ he, 'to lose his men̛ þus in vayne.
Bot it sitteȝ tiƚƚ hym for to determyne his cause with his awenn̛ handeȝ.
And þarefore late thi folke stand stiƚƚ on þe ta syde, & myn̛ on þe toþer

said Porus dispysand̛ Alexander, bicause þat he was a man̛ of littiƚƚ

knawande þe vertu & þe hardnes þat was hidd̛ in Alexander.
And than bathe þe ostes stode stiƚƚ ant lete þe twa kyngeȝ feghte samen̛,
Porus gaffe Alexander a grete strke on̛ þe hede, & was in poynte to

Porus tourned̛ hym to þam̛warde for to reproue þam̛ for þaire schowttyng.
And Alexandsr went tiƚƚ hym manfully & tuke his swerd̛ in bathe his

And when̛ þe Indienes saw that þay bigan scharply for to fighte wit

quoþ he, 'wharto feghte ȝe sen̛ ȝour kynge es dede. Wate ȝe noȝte wele

quoþ þay, 'fighte manfully, and dye in the felde, þan̛ for to see þe

herde thir wordes þay keste fra þam̛ þaire wapyneȝ & thanked̛ Alexander
and wirchiped̛ him riȝte als he hadd̛ bene a godd̛. Than kyng Alexander
luged̛ hym þare & his Oste wit hym, & he command̛ to bery þe dede corseȝ

Fra thethyn̛ Alexander remowed̛ his Oste & come tiƚƚ a cuntree þat was
called̛ Oxidraces. The folkes of þat cuntree are wonder Symple men̛, and
noȝte prowde, & þay are called̛ Gumnosophiste. Þay feghte neuer mare ne

 'The coruptible Gumnosophist vntiƚƚ Alexander a man̛ wee

When̛ Alexander had radd̛ this lettre he sent ane ansuere agayne on̛ this

And þan̛ he wente into þe cuntree whare þay duelled̛. And he saw þam̛ ga

Anoþer day, he come wit his Oste tiƚƚ a place wharee twa ymageȝ ware, þe

hafe passede ouer this ryuere, þay myȝte noȝte be cause it was riȝte

Fra thethin þay went aboute towardeȝ þe lefte party of Inde and come

Marras, belyue þare come owte of þe redeȝ a beste lyke ane ypotayne,
whase breste was lyke to þe cocadriƚƚe, and his bakke lyk a sawe, and
his tethe wonder grete, & als scharpe as a suerde; bot in his gangyng he was


 

als slaw als a snyle. And, in his oute come, he slew twa knyghtis of
Alexander. This ilke beste myȝte þay on na wyse perche wit þaire speres.
Bot wit mellis of yren̛ þay slew it.

And fra þeine þay trauelde thritty day iourneȝ and come to þe vttermaste
iles of Inde, & þare þay luged̛ þam̛ besideȝ a ryuere þat es callede in
þat langage of Inde Hemmahurer. And aboute þe Eleuend̛ houre þar come

fered̛ and durste noȝte go to þam̛. And Alexander saide vnto þam, 'My

durste noȝte habyde. And Alexander & his men̛ pursued̛ tham̛, and what wit
nettis, whatt wit swerdes & speres, þay slewe of þam̛ a grete multitude,
and come agayne to thaire tentis.

Anoþer day þay removed̛ þeine, and trauelde thurgℏ the same woddeȝ of
Inde. And þay fande þare women̛ with berdis rechande downn̛ to þaire

said, 'We lyffe aƚƚ,' quoþ þay, 'wit venyson̛ þat we take in thir woddes
thurgℏ huntynge.'

When̛ þay ware passed̛ oute of thir woddeȝ þay come intiƚƚ a faire felde

als rugℏe of hare as þay hade bene bestes. Whase kynde & custom̛ it was
als wele to be in þe water, als on̛ þe lande. And als sone als þay saw
Alexander Oste onane þay fledd̛ to þe water, and dowked intill it. Fra
þeine þay traueld̛ xv day iournee, and entred̛ intiƚƚ woddes þat ware
fuƚƚ of cynocephals, þe whilke als son̛ als þay saw Alexander & his oste

wit speres & nettes slew a grete multitude of þam̛, and þe remenaunt of
þam̛ fledd̛ here and thare in þe woddeȝ.

Fra thethyn̛ þay went fourty dayes & come intiƚƚ a champaynne cuntree,
þat was aƚƚ Barayne, and na hye place ne na hilles myghte be sene on na

wynde tuk firebrandes oute of fyres þat þay hadd̛ made, and smate
dyuerse men̛ & brynte þam̛. And þan̛ Alexander knyghtes mournurede gretly &
said amangeȝ þam, 'Þe wrethe & þe wreke of oure goddeȝ,' quoþ þay,
'falleȝ apon̛ vs, Bicause we seke to ferre towarde þe son̛ rysynge.' 'My

was cessed̛ þay gadirde tegedir þat þe wynd̛ hadd̛ sparpled̛.

Fra þeine þay went xxv days and come intiƚƚ a grene valay, and þare þay
luged̛ þam̛. Than commanded̛ Alexander þat þay schuld make many fyres. For
it began̛ for to be vnsufferable calde. And thare began for to falle

Alexander saw that, he was ferde þat it schuld̛ noȝte hafe cessed̛ sone,

Fra thethin, þay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a grete ryuere þat es called̛
Ganges & þare þay luged þam̛. And as þay luked̛ ouer on the toþer syde,
þay saw twa or thre men̛ walke up & downn̛ þare. And Alexander badd̛ his

said̛. 'We are Bragmayns,' quoþ þay. Alexander hadd̛ grete desyre to speke
wit þe Bragmayns. Bot he myȝte noȝte wynn̛ ouer þe water; it was so depe

also it was fuƚƚ of ypotaynes & scorpyones and cocadrilles, out taken̛ in

was kyng of þe Bragmayns, of whilk lettre þis was þe tenour.

When̛ Alexander hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, he was wonder wrathe, because of

When Dindimus hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre, onane he wrate anoþer to kyng

 'Dyndimus, þe mayster of þe Bragmayns, vntiƚƚ Alexander, gretyng.
 We hafe vndirstand þe tenour of þi lettres & þus we ansuere. We er

When Alexander hadd̛ redd̛ þis lettre onane he sente anoþer agayne and

When Alexander had̛ sent this lettre tiƚƚ Dyndimus he gart


 

rayse vp a pelare of Marble a wonder grete, & an heghe, and gart writt
þareapon this title wit lettres of grewe, of latyne, and of þe langage
of Inde. 'I Alexander, Philipp̛ son of Macedoyne, after þe discomfytour &
þe dedd̛ of Darius & Porus come on werre vnto this place.'

Fra þeine kyng Alexander & his Oste remowed̛ & come intiƚƚ a felde, þat
was called̛ Actea & þare þay luged̛. Abowte þat felde was a thikke wodd̛ of
treesse berand̛ fruyte; of þe whilke wilde men̛ þat duelt in þe Same wodd̛
vsede for tiƚƚ hafe þaire fude, whase bodyes ware grete as geaunteȝ, and
þaire clethynge ware made of skynnes of dyuerse besteȝ. And when̛ þay saw
Alexander Oste luge þare, onane þare come oute of þe wodd̛, a grete
multitude of þam̛ wit lange roddes in þaire handȝ & bigan̛ for to feghte

swilke a noyse. And than̛ þay began̛ to flee hedir & thedir in þe wodd̛.
And Alexander & his men̛ persued̛ þam̛ and slewe of þam̛ vic xxx iiij. And
þay slew of Alexander knyghtes xxvij. In þat felde Alexander & his oste
leuged̛ iij dayes and vetailed̛ þam of þat fruyte þat growed̛ in þe wodd̛.

Fra þeine pay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a grete ryuer, & luged̛ þam þare. And
as it ware abowte none, þare come apon̛ þam a wilde man̛, als mekiƚƚ als a

knyghtis tak hym̛ & bryng hym bifor hym̛. And when̛ þay come abowte hym,
he was na thynge fered, ne fledd̛ noȝte, bot stodd̛ baldly bifore þam̛.
And when Alexander saw that, he comanded̛ þat þay sulde take a ȝonge

onane, he ranne apon̛ ℏir romyandd̛ as he hadd̛ bene wodd̛. Bot þe knyghtes
wit grete deficcultee refte hyr fra hym. And ay he romyed̛ & made grete

And Alexander wonderd̛ gretly of his figure. And þan̛ he


 

gerte bynd̛ hym tiƚƚ a tree & make a fyre abowte hym & brynne hym. And so
þay didd̛. Fra þeine þay remowed̛ & come tiƚƚ anoþer felde in þe whilke
þare ware growand̛ treesse, of a wonderfuƚƚ heghte, and þay bigan̛ for to

þan̛ þay herd̛ a voyce in þe ayer þat said̛ on þis wyse: 'What man̛ so

 Than þay remowed̛ fra þeine, And come tiƚƚ a Mountayne, þat was

þay come to þe fote of a mountayne whare aƚƚ þe Oste thurgℏ a wikked

And when̛ þay come to þe


 

hegheste of þis Mountayne, þay saw on þe toþer syde faire weder &

ware growande treesse witowtten̛ nowmer; and þay passed noȝte a cubit in

Than Alexander demed̛ þat that dyuyson̛ betwix þase Mountaynes was made

þan̛ he gart a pavysse be made seuen̛ cubites of lenghte & foure on̛ brede;
and on̛ þe vtter syde þareoffe he gart sett a grete Mirroure, And a

basilisc opynde his eghne. And wit a grete ire he bibelde þe Mirroure
and saw hymselfe þarein. And of þe refleccion̛ of þe bemes of his

saw þe Basilisc dede. And þan̛ þay comended̛ & prayssed̛ gretly his

Fra þeine þay went tiƚƚ þey come to þe ferreste of þat waye ; and

þam̛ and cragges like walles þat þay myȝte passe no forþer. And þan̛ þay
turned̛ agayne, and come to þe forsaide playne; and went by þat way þat
streched̛ towarde þe weste fyvftene .xv. days. And þan̛ þay lefte þat
way, And turnede on̛ þe lefte hande. And so þay went foure score iiij days, and at þe
laste þay come tiƚƚ a Mountayne of adamande; and at þe fute þareoffe
þare hange chynes of golde. Þis Mountayne hadd̛ made of saphyres
twa thowsande greeȝ & a halfe, by þe whilke men̛ ascendid̛ to þe summit of

And on þe morne Alexander Offerd̛ sacrafice tiƚƚ his goddes, And þan̛ he
tuk with hym xij twelue prynceȝ of þe wyrchipfulleste þat he hade, and
went vp bi þe forsaid̛ greeȝ till he come aboun̛ on̛ þe Mountayne. And þare

called̛ þe howse of þe son̛. Þare was also


 

a temple aƚƚ of golde & of precious stanes, And bifore þe dores þareoffe þare was a vyne of golde, berande grapes of charbuncles, of Rubyes,
Dyamandeȝ, and many oþer maneres of precyous stanes. Þan̛ kyng Alexander
& his princeȝ went into þe palace; and fande þare a man̛ liggand̛ in a

and þe tayle was ownnded̛ ouerthwert, wit a colour reede as rose & wit
blewe. And his fethers ware riȝte faire schynand̛. When̛ Alexander saw þis
fewle he was gretely meruailled̛ of þe faired̛ of hym; þan̛ saide þe Alde
man̛: 'Alexander,' quoþ he, 'þis ilke fewle þat þou here seese es a
fenix.' And þan̛ þay went forþer thurgℏ þe forsaid̛ wodd̛, And come to
thiese haly treeȝ of þe son̛ & þe mone þat growed̛ in myddeȝ of þe wodde.
And þan̛ þe alde man̛ saide tiƚƚ Alexander: 'Luke vp,' quoþ he, 'to ȝone
haly treeȝ, and thynke in thi hert what preuatee so þe liste, and þou
saƚƚ hafe a trewe ansuere. Bot luke þat þou speke na worde in opyn̛. And
þareby saƚƚ þou witt þat it es a gude spiritt, þat knawes thi thoghte.'
Thir twa treeȝ were wonder hye. And þe tree of þe Son̛ had̛ leues lyk fyne
golde, reed & faire schynande. And þe tree of þe mone had lefes whitt
als syluer & faire schynande. And þan̛ walde Alexander hafe Offrede
Sacrafyce to þir treeȝ. Bot þe alde man̛ walde noȝte suffre hym̛, bot
said̛: 'It es noȝte leuefuƚƚ,' quoþ he, 'in þis haly place, nowþer to
offre encense, ne to slaa na besteȝ, Bot to knele doun̛ to þe boles of
þir treeȝ & kysse þam̛ & pray þe son̛ & þe mone to giffe trew ansuers.'
And þan Alexander spirred̛ þe alde man̛, in what langage þe treeȝ sulde
giffe þaire answers. And þe alde man̛ ansuerd̛ & said̛: 'The tree of þe
Son,' quoþ he, 'answers owþer aƚƚ in þe langage of Inde or eƚƚs of

wit þe langage of Inde.'

And as þay stode þus spekande, Sudaynly þare come a bryghte beme fra þe
weste þat schane ouer aƚƚ þe wodde. And þan̛ Alexander kneled̛ doun̛, and
kyssede þe treeȝ an thoght þus in his hert: 'Saƚƚ I conquere aƚƚ þe
werlde, and efterwardeȝ wit þe victorye wende hame to Macedoyne tiƚƚ my

ansuerd̛ softly in þe langage of Inde, And said þir verseȝ: 'Tu
dominatorum orbis dominus simul et pater extas,Set patrum rignum per

and whate dedd̛ he sulde dye. And þe tree of þe Mone ansuerd̛ by þir twa

Þan̛ bigan̛ Alexander to thynke in his hert on̛ þis wyse,

 'Tell me now, haly tree,Wha he es þat sall slaa mee.'

And þan̛ þe tree of þe son̛ ansuerd̛ by þir twa verseȝ: 'Si tibi pandatur
vir qui tua facta resoluet,Illum confrynges & sic mea carmina fallent.'
Þat es at say: 'And I schew the þe manes name, þat saƚƚ vndo thi dedis,
þou wiƚƚ slaa hym̛, and so saƚƚ my prophycye fayle.' And þan̛ þe forsaide
ald man̛ sayd̛ tiƚƚ Alexander: 'Disese na mare þir trees,' quoþ he, 'wit
thyne askynges. Bot tourne we agayne, as we come hedir.' And þan̛
Alexander & his twa prynceȝ wit hym tourned̛ agayne wit þe alde man̛. And
ay as he went, he weped̛ bitterly, bicause of his schorte tyme; and his
prynceȝ also weped riȝte sare. Bot he commanded̛ þam̛ þat þay schulde
noȝte teƚƚe to na man̛ of his Oste þat that þay hadd̛ herde & sene. And
when̛ þay ware comen̛ to þe forsaide Palace þe alde said̛ vntiƚƚ
Alexander: ' Torne bakke agayne,' quoth he, 'for it es noȝte leefuƚƚ to

noȝte traueƚƚe fuƚƚ lange are þou come to þe place, whare þe liste to

and Alexander and his twa prynceȝ went doun̛ by þe forsaide greeȝ & come
to þe Oste.

Apon þe morne Alexander & his Oste remowed̛ þeine & went agayneward̛
fyftene days, And come agayne to þe forsaid̛ playne & þare þay luged þam̛.
And þare at þe entree of þa twa forsaid̛ ways, Alexander gart rayse vp
twa pelers of Marble, and bytwixe þam̛ he haude a table of golde, on þe
whilke was wretyn in þe langage of grewe, hebrew, of latyne, and of
Inde, one this wyse: 'I, Alexander, Phillipp̛ son̛ of Macedoyne,


 

sett thir pelers here, after þe dedd̛ of Darius kyng of Perse and of

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ thurgℏ þat playne and lefte þase strayte wayes,

þay come tiƚƚ a cuntree þat highte Prasiac, And þare þay luged̛ þam̛. And
when̛ men̛ of þat cuntree herd̛ of þe commynge of Alexander, wit grete

'Alexander þe son̛ of godd̛ Amon̛ & of þe quene Olympias, kyng of kynges &

Amangeȝ her embassatours þat scho sent tiƚƚ Alexander þare was a wonder

when̛ þay come hame þe payntour tuke hir þe fegure of Alexander purtrayed̛

scho desyred̛ gretly for to see his fygure.

After þis ane of þe quene sonnes þat hight Candeolus went furthe of þe
Citee wit his wyfe and a fewe of his menȝee for to take þe sporte. And
onane þe kyng of þe Bebrikes, knawyng þe fairehed̛ of Candeolus wyfe,

þay come to þe citee, þe waytes cryed̛ apon̛ þam̛, and askede what þay

quoþ he, 'to þe emperour and asche hym leue.' And þay did̛ soo; and when̛
he had leue, he went wit Candeolus. And as þay went togedir þay come

And when̛ Candace herd teƚƚ þat hir son̛ Candeolus and his wyfe ware

And ledd̛ hym vp tiƚƚ hir chambir, whare þare ware beddes arayed̛ wit þe

Þat day Alexander ete wit quene Candace & hir childire.

Apon̛ þe morne quene Candace tuk Alexander by þe right hande & ledd̛ hym

What may now thi grete Imperiaƚƚ glory, thi witt & thi mighte serue

'resonably I am angry at my selfe bicause I hafe na swerde here.' Quoþ

'Sothely,' quoþ he, 'bicause I hafe wilfully betrayed̛ myselfe vnto

Neuerþelesse my wyfe constreyneȝ me for to do Antyochus to dede bicause of þe dede of hir Fadir Porus, whilke Alexander slewe, So þat

Than kyng Alexander and Candeolus went furthe aƚƚ that daye, And come

And þare he sawe a myrke clowde, & in þat myrknesse, he sawe as it ware

And Alexander ansuerd̛ & said̛: 'Lorde,' quoþ he, '& þou wiƚƚ graunt me

And þan̛ Alexander come oute of þe caue, and tuke his leue at Candeolus

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ & come intiƚƚ a place in þe whilke þare ware

And fra þeine þay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a grete ryuer þe whilke was
twenty furlange on brede fra þe ta banke to þe toþer. And on þase bankes
þare growed̛ redis wonder grete and hye. Of þase redes garte Alexander
mak bates & anoynte þam̛ wit terre & talgℏ of besteȝ, And badd̛ his
knyghtis row ouer þe water in þase bates. And þay did̛ soo. And when̛ þe
 of þe cunntree herde teƚƚ of þe commynge of Alexander & his
Oste, þay sent hym gyftes of swylk thyngeȝ als was in þaire cuntree, þat
es at say Grete spoungeȝ bathe whitte & purpure & schelles of þe see so

wormes þat þay drew owte of þat ryuer grettere þan̛ a manes thee, and þay
ware swetter of taste þan̛ any fysche. Þay gaffe hym Cukstoles aƚƚ rede
þat ware of a wonderfuƚƚ gretnesse. In þat ryuer ware womans þat ware
wonder faire & þay hade on̛ þam̛ mekiƚƚ here þat rechedd̛ doun̛ to thaire

owþer þay drownned̛ þam̛ in þe water, or eƚƚs þay walde lede þam̛ to þe
redeȝ þat growed̛ on̛ þe water bankes and garre þam̛ lye by þam̛ ay tiƚƚ any

þam̛ tiƚƚ Alexander, and þay ware als white as any snawe,
and þay ware ten fote lange and þaire teethe ware lyke dogge teethe.

Efter this Alexander went and closed̛ in a maner of folkee þat are called̛
Gog & Magog, within þe hilleȝ of Caspy. Þis folkeȝ were of þe ten
kyndeȝ of Israel, and þay ware leedd̛ owte of þaire awenn̛ land̛ bi a kyng

asched̛ Alexander leue for to wende furtℏ of þat cuntree. And Alexander
gert spirre þe cause of þaire thraldom̛, and he was encensed̛ þat because þay


 

hadd̛ forsaken̛ þaire goddeȝ lawe, þat es at say, godd̛ of Isrƚ, and
wirchiped̛ Calues & oþer Mawmettes, þarefore þay ware ledd̛ oute of þaire
awenn̛ lande & halden̛ in thralldom̛, and þat prophetes had prophiced̛ before þat þay sulde neuer come oute of thraldom̛ bifore agayne þe day of

seurely. And þan̛ he garte close aƚƚ þe entreeȝ wit stane & lyme & sand̛,
Bot aƚƚ þat he garte make on þe day was fordone on̛ þe nyghte. And when̛
Alexander saw þat mannes laboure myghte noȝte stande in stede, he bisoghte godd̛ of Isrƚ þat if it ware his liste þat þay habade þare, þat he
walde close þam̛ in. And þe nexte nyghte aftir ilk a cragge feƚƚe tiƚƚ

þat it es noȝte goddeȝ wiƚƚ þat þay come oute. Neuerþelesse abowte þe
Ende of þe werlde þay saƚƚ breke oute and do mekiƚƚ schathe & slaa many men̛.

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ & come to þe grete See Occeane. In þat See þay
sawe ane Ile a littiƚƚ fra þe lande. And in þat Ile þay herde men̛ speke
grewe. And þan̛ Alexander commanded̛ þat sum̛ of his knyghts sulde do off
þaire clathes and swyme ouer to þe ile. And þay did̛ soo. And als sone
als þay come in þe See þare come gret crabbes vp oute of þe water &
pullede þam̛ downne to þe grounde & drownned̛ þam̛.

Thanne remowed̛ þay fra thethyn̛ and went ay endlande þe See syde towarde
þe solstice of wynter trauellande xƚ days; and at þe laste þay come to a
reede See, and þare þay lugede þam̛. Þare was faste by a Mountayne wonder

þareoffe, hym thoghte þat he was nerre þe Firmament þan þe erthe; þan̛
he ymagned̛ in his hert swilk a gynn̛ how he myghte make grippes

garte come bifore hym̛ his Maistre wrightes and comandid̛ þam̛ þat þay
sulde make hym a chayer and trelesse it wit barreȝ of Iren̛ one ilk a

gripes and tye þam̛ faste wit Iren̛ cheynes vnto þe chayere, and in þe
ouermare party of þe chayere he gart putt


 

mete for þe grippes. And pan̛ he wente and sett hym̛ in þe chayere. And
onane þe grippes bare hym vp in þe ayer so hye þat Alexander thoghte aƚƚ

his Oste.

After þis Alexander ymagened in his hert þat he walde knaw þe preuates
þat are in þe see. And onane he gart come bifore hym̛ aƚƚ þe Maister
glasyers þat ware in þe Oste, And comandede þam̛ to make hym a grete

þe tounne & gart pykke wele þe entree whare he went in, and þan̛ late it
doun̛ into þe See. And þare he sawe dyuerse schappes of fisches of
dyuerse colours; and sum̛ he sawe hafe þe schappe of dyuerse besteȝ here

treesse þat groweȝ on þe See grunde. Þir besteȝ come tiƚƚ hym. Bot onane
as þay saw hym thorow þe glasse þay fledde fra hym. He sawe þare also
many oþer meruaylous thyngeȝ, þe whilke he walde teƚƚ na man̛ bicause
men̛ walde noghte hafe trowed̛ þam̛ if he had talde þam̛, and at a certayne
houre þase þat he hadd̛ assyngned before, his knyghtes drewe hym vp oute
of þe See.

Fra þeine þay Remowed̛ Folowande þe bankes of þe Rede See, and luged þam̛
in a place, whare þare ware wylde Besteȝ that hade on̛ þaire heuedis
hornes lyke vnto sawes, and þay ware als scharpe als
swerdeȝ. And with thire hornes þay slewe & hurte many knyghtis of
Alexanders & cloue þaire cheldes in sonder. Neuerþelesse Alexander
knyghtis slew of þam̛ ccccli.

And fra beine þay remowed̛ and come intiƚƚ wilderness


 

bitwex þe reed̛ See and Araby, whare grete multitude of Pepir growed̛; And
þare ware many grete nedders wit hornnes on þaire hedes lyke tuppe
hornes, wit þe whilke þay smate Alexander knyghtis riȝt felly. Off þase
nedderes slew þe Macedoynes a grete party.

Þeine þay remowed̛ and luged̛ in a place whare many Rynosephales ware, þe
whilke hade heuedes & manes lyke horseȝ. And þay hade grete bodys, and
wonder grete teethe and lange, and oute of þaire mouthes þay schotte

his knyghtes and bad þam̛ feghte manly wit þase monstres. And so þay
didd̛. Neuerþelesse þare ware a grete multitude of his knyghtis slayne
of þase besteȝ. Bot of þe Rynocephales þare was slayne an hugge multitude.

Þan̛ þay remowed̛ fra þeine and come intiƚƚ a champayne cuntree and luged̛
þam̛ þare, And lay þare a certane days, Bicause of his horse Buktyphalas
þat feƚƚ seke þare; of þe whilke sekenesse he dyed̛. And when̛ Alexander
saw hym dedd̛ he made grete dole for hym and weped̛ for hym riȝt sare. For
he hadd̛ borne hym in many a Bateƚƚe, and broghte oute of many
pereƚƚs. And þarefore when̛ he was dede Alexander gart doo aboute hym
grete exequyes and gart make hym a fuƚƚ riche toumbe & a hye and did̛ hym
þarein and made a grete citee þare, þe whilke in mynde of his horse he
gart caƚƚ Buktyphalas.

Fra þeine þay remowed̛ and come tiƚƚ a ryuere þat was called̛ Cytan or
Deciracy whare men̛ of þe cuntree broghte hym̛ ṽ Olyphantes and ṽ cartes

in þat Palace þay fande beddeȝ of clene golde many a thowsande. Þare
ware also grete fewles white als doufes, þe whilke had knawyng before

FRa þeine þay remowed̛ and come to þe grete Citee of Babiloyne and wanne
it oo werre and slew þe kynge þareoffe & þe Captayne also. And pare he
duelled̛ vntiƚƚ his lyffes end̛, and pat was Bot vij seuen̛ Monethes. In
þat mene tyme Alexander sent a lettre tiƚƚ Olympias his Moder and tiƚƚ
his Mayster Arestotle, latand̛ þam̛ witte of þe Bateƚƚs and þe dyssese þat
þay suffred̛ bathe wynters and Somers in Inde and oþer cuntreeȝ, and also
of þe Bateƚƚs þat þay had̛ hadd̛ wit dyuerse Monstres. And þan̛ Arestotle
wrate anoþer lettre tiƚƚ Alexander agayne þe whilke was of this tenour:

 'Untiƚƚ Alexandere þe grete kynge of kyngeȝ Arestotle sendeȝ ioy
 and seruyce. When̛ I hade redde ȝour wyrchipfuƚƚ lettres I was gretly

 For þou hase sene & assayed̛ thyngeȝ þat neuer man̛ or þis durste

Afftir þis Alexander gart make in Babyloyne a wonder curious trone of
golde, þare was noȝte swilke anoþer in þe werlde. For þe grekeȝ broghte
so mekiƚƚ golde oute of perse & oute of Inde, þat it ware wonder for to
telle. Þis ilke toure was twlue cubyteȝ hye and by twelue greceȝ men̛
ascended̛ þaretoo, and þase greeȝ ware aƚƚ of golde. Þis trone was
wonderfully wroghte and sett apon̛ twelue ymageȝ of golde, þe whilke
trone þe forsaid̛ ymageȝ helde vp wit þaire hende. And on þase twelue
ymageȝ ware wretyn̛ þe names of þe twelue prynceȝ of Macedoyne. Þe seet
of þe trone was of a Smaragde,


 

& þe sydeȝ þare off ware of Topaȝes & in ilkan̛ of þe greeȝ ware sett
dyuerse maneres of precyouse stanes. In þe summyt of þis trone þare
wassett a ruby þat schane on þe nyghte as it hade bene þe Mone. In þis
trone also was þare sett on̛ ilke a syde dyuerse ymageȝ on þe whilke ware
wretyn̛ bathe in latyne & in grew verseȝ þat contened̛ aƚƚ þe
nammes of þe rewmes & cuntreeȝ þat Alexandere had conquered̛ and ware
sugetes vntiƚƚ hym.

After þis Alexander gert make a coron̛ of golde sett fuƚƚ of aƚƚ maner of
precyouse stanes, and gert wryte apon̛ it a tytle in grew & in latyn̛:
'Ortus & occasus, Aquilo michi seruit & Auster.' Þat es at saye: 'Est &
weste, Northe & southe dose seruyce vnto me.' In the mene tyme whils
Alexander was in babyloyne, a woman̛ was delyuer of a knaue childe þe
whilke fra þe heuede to þe nauyƚƚ hadd̛ schappe of man̛, & was borne dedd̛.
And fra þe nauyƚƚ downwardeȝ it had lyknesse of dyuerse besteȝ and was
qwykke. Þis Monstre was taken̛ & broghte tiƚƚ Alexander; and als son̛ als
he saw it he meruaylled̛ gretly þareoff, and gart come bifore hym̛ a
philosopher þat couthe of wichecrafte, & aschede hym what it sygnyfyed̛.
And when̛ þe philosopher saw it, he syghede, & saye wepand̛ sayde vnto
hym: 'Sothely wirchipfuƚƚ emperour,' quoþ he, 'þe tyme commeȝ nere that
þou saƚƚ passe oute of this werlde.' 'Telle me,' quoþ Alexander,
'whareby þou knawes þat.' And þe philosophre ansuerde & sayde: 'My
lorde,' quoþ he, 'þe halfe of þis Monstre þat hase þe schappe of man̛ &
es dedd̛, betakens þat þou saƚƚ passe out of þis werlde in haste. And þe
toþer party þat hase þe lyknes of dyuerse besteȝ & es on lyfe,
betakynges þe kynges þat saƚƚ come after þe. Bot þare saƚƚ nane of þam̛
be lyke vnto þe, na mare þan̛ a beste es lyke vntiƚƚ a man̛.' When̛
Alexander herde þis he was wonder heuy, and sare wepand̛ he sayde on þis
wyse: 'O Aƚƚmyghty Iubiter,' quoþ he, 'what meneȝ it þat my dayes saƚƚ
be so schortte ? Me thynke þat it had bene semely þat I had leffed̛

mekiƚƚ als it es noȝte plesande vnto þe, I beseke the þat þou resayffe

In this mene tyme þare was in Macedoyne a lorde þat highte


 

Antipater, þe whilke of langetyme before hadd̛ casten for þe dedde of
Alexander; And wit many oþer þat he hadd̛ confedred̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛ he
conspyred̛ for to brynge it tyƚƚ ende, bot he myghte neuer come aboute
þerwith. For Olympias, Alexander moder, wrate vntiƚƚ hym oftesythes
and warned̛ hym þat he scholde be warre wit Antipater & his childre, and
herefore was Antypater wonder sary. So apon̛ a tyme he vmbythoghte hym
þat he myghte neuer come aboute wit his purpose for to slaa Alexander,
bot if it ware thurgℏ enpuysonynge. And so apon̛ a daye he went
tiƚƚ a Soteƚƚ leche, and boghte of hym̛ a maner of drynke made of puyson̛
that was so feƚƚe & se ranke þat þare myghte no vesseƚƚe halde it Bot a
vesseƚƚ made of Iren̛; and þarein he putt it. And þan̛ he gaffe it his
son̛ Cassandre, and bad̛ hym bere it tiƚƚ his broþer Iobas and byd̛ hym,
quoþ he, gyffe it to kyng Alexander in his drynke, when̛ he seeȝ his
tyme. This ilk Iobas was a faire ȝong man̛ & was duellyng with Alexander,
and gretly byluffede & cheriste of hym. Bot so it befeƚƚe apon̛ a tyme
þat Alexander smate Iobas on þe heued̛ wit a warderere for na trespasse.
Wharefore Iobas was gretly angred̛ and greued̛ at Alexander and consented̛
tiƚƚ his dede, and tuke þe puyson̛ of his broþer þat was ordeyned̛ for
Alexander dede þat luffed̛ hym̛ so mekiƚƚ.

And apon̛ a daye Alexander gart ordeyne a grete reueƚƚe in Babyloyne and
called̛ þare too aƚƚ his prynceȝ on̛ ilke a syde. And as he satt at þe
mete Imange his prynceȝ he was wonder mery & gladde & iocund̛, and
reheted̛ his lordeȝ & prayed̛ þam̛ þat þay schulde be mery. Þan̛ Iobas þat
serued̛ þe kyng of his coupe tuke of þe puyson̛ a porcyon̛, and putt it
vnder þe nayle of his thowme, and broghte þe coppe to þe kynge fuƚƚ of
wyne. And as he gaffe it to þe kynge, he lete þe puyson̛ faƚƚe in þe wyne
priualy. And als sone als þe kyng hadd̛ dronken̛ þe puyson̛, Sudaynly he
gaffe a grete scryke, and lened̛ hym downn̛ towarde þe riȝte syde. For hym
thoghte reghte als a man̛ hadd̛ smyten̛ hym into þe lyuere wit a suerde.
Neuerþelesse he feyned̛ & forbare a while & suffred̛ a grete penance,
and when̛ he myȝte na langere habyde, he rase vp fra þe burde and saide
tiƚƚ his lordeȝ & his knyghtes: 'Lordyngis,' quoþ he,


 

'I pray ȝow sitt ȝe stiƚƚ & eteȝ & drynkeȝ & beeȝ mery.' Bot þay ware
gretly troubbled̛ and rase vp fra þe burdeȝ and stode witowtten̛ for to

and soghte a fethir for to putt in his throtte for to garre hym hafe a
vomet of þe puyson̛ þat he hadd̛ resayffed̛. And Iobas, þat was cheffe of
aƚƚ this hye treson̛, gatt a fethir & enoynt it wit þe same puyson̛ &
broghte it tiƚƚ Alexander; and he tuk it & putt it in his throtte, and
belyfe þe puyson̛ vexed̛ hym ay mare & mare. And þan̛
Alexander bade ane gange & open̛ þe palace ȝates þat ware on Eufrates

mydnyȝthte he rase oute of þe bedde þat he lay in and putt oute þe

And Rosan̛ his wyfe folowed̛ as faste as scho myghte. And when̛ scho come

and sare wepand̛ said̛ vntiƚƚ hym̛: 'A, A, my swete lorde,' quoþ scho, 'if

onane he callede vntiƚƚ hym Iobas & bade hym feche vntiƚƚ hym Semyon̛
