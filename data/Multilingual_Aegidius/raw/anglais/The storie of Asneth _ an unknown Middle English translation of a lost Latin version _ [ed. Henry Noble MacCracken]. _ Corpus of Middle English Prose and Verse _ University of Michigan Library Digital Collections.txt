THE STORY OF ASNETH.


 PROLOGUE.

As I on hilly halkes logged me late, Beside ny of a ladi sone was I war;
La bele me desired in englysh to translate


 

The latyn of that lady, Asneth putifar. And I answered, "ma bele,
langage I lakke, To parfourme youre plesir, for yt ys ful straunge
That broken tuskes shold wel harde nuttis crakke, And kerue out the
kernelis, to glade with yowre graunge; For lame and vnlusty, now age
hath me left, Mi spiritis are spended, I lakke sapience, 
Dulled I am with dotage, my reson ys me reft, Prived and departed from
al eloquence, So my seson ys passed with language to iape. Hit ys not
fetis for to see a cowe in a cage Ye desire to make a fool of
my lordis ape. 
He plesed neuer lady wel þat lakked corage, For as þe oule ys vn able to
blase þe sunne bemys, So ys þe moselyng molle to iaile þe rede rose, And
as able ys þe asse to danielis dremys,
As þe cukkou with crochetis ony countour to close." And when
daunger deynusly here desire refused, Labele ful benignely sayde to me
þan, "That seruant ys not to blame, but fully excused, That meketh hym
to his maystresse, & doth as he can." Concluded þus with gentilnesse, I
toke on me þe cure, 
Asneth storie to translate after my cunyng, Fro latyn into englysh as
god me sendeth oeure. Gyde þis werke, gracious lord, and graunte it good
endyng, Utterali the latyn in englysh to transpose, Hit is nuyus, but þe
sentence I schal sue in trace, 
And yf ye fynde fautes, grave hem with yowr glose, I pray ȝow thus, my
maystresse, of yowre good grace.


 THE STORY.

Pharao the famus kyng of egipt land aboute, The firste yeer of seven
yeeris of plentevus abundance, The fifthe day, in þe secunde monthe, he
sende Ioseph oute 


 

To purveie wete for þe peple of his obeisance; And in the ferthe monthe,
þe eyhtethe day, to make pur∣veance Ioseph cam into þe cuntre of
helinpoleos, And gadered whete of that region, nobeli sprang his loos.
And in þat cite þere was a prince of Pharao the kynges, That was
wondir noble and riche, and of gret prudence, Sad of conseyl, meke, and
wise, in alle maner thyngys; Chief cunseilour to Pharao for his
intelligence. Above alle princes he was preferred for his excellence; Of
Helinpoleos preest, Putifar, so men did hym calle, Honoured in
alle egipt of gret and of smalle.
This prince hadde a dowter dere, Asneth was her name, A virgine ful
specious and semely of stature, Of eyhtene yeer age sche was, withoute
ony blame, Florishyng in here beaute, the most comely creature Of
egipt, and alle virgines sche passed in feture. Not lyke the dowhtres of
egipt in here resemblance, But assemblyng the hebrees in colour and
countenance.


 

Of stature semeli as sair, specious as rebekke, Fair formed of feturis,
assemblyng to rachel. Her cors was ful comely of hue, hed & nekke.
Cumfortable, of cuntenance, hit becam here wel; Of here souerain beaute
al egipt gan tel, And praysed here in alle þat lande, so noble was here
fame, That bataile among princes children was ioyned for þat dame.
But when þat pharaois eldist child, his sone & his heir, Herde telle of
this ladi, to his fadir he wente right, And said, "graunte me to my wyf
asneth the feyr." But pharao denyed hym, and answered to the knyght,
"Thu schalt haue to þin astate a ladi of more myght, The kyngis
dowter of moab, of noble alliance, A comeli quene, fair and free, evene
to þi plesance."
But asneth, þat was so feir, soleyn she was with al, Dispisyng eche man
deynusly, and prowd of here corage. A ful high tour was bild for here,
of werk þat was rial, Ioynyng to hire fadir hous, and aboue it
vpon stage Ten chambres for here wer bild, of precious parage. The
firste was fair and large, with porfereit stonis walled, Poudred with
precious polimites, of diuerse colours called.
With carpettis of cloth of gold hit was laid abowte, And in the
wallis here egipt godis sette in sundry wyse, Wrouht of goold & siluer
wel, of hem sche had gret doute, For eueri day to the same sche dide
sacrifice.


 

In the secunde chamber was here atire, of ful riche assise, Goold,
siluer, precious stonis, and garnementis gaye, Schetis of silk,
and robis fyne, of ful riche araye.
The thridde chamber was for stoor stuffed as ye shul here Of alle goodis
þat growe on erthe, to mannys sustinance, The seuen chambiris remenant were ordeyned on þis manere. For seven maidenes,
þat lowly serued here with plesance, Tise were here egipt
eveneldis, to here daliance, Fair of face, bright of ble, as sterre in
þe firmament, With man ne manlchild speke þei, in no manere entent.
In the chief chambir of asneth þer were wyndowys three; The
firste retardyng to the est, the secunde was south right,
Te thirde lay north upon þe strete, in swyche manere degre That of
alle that passed by, sche mihte haue a syght. In this chamir a bed was
raid, of goold and purpur bright; Context it was with iacinth and purpur
bise with all: Alone lay asneth in this bed, that riche was and riall.

A gret halle was bild abowte, with wallis wonder hie, With foure yren
gatis spered faste and stronge; And kepte with eyhtene men of armes,
harneised surely. Yet þer were planted inside þe halle trees faire behonge,


 

With frutes þat were delectable, and fair leues among, And a
cundite beside þe halle, þat ran as cristall clere,
That moisted the trees lustily, and dide to hem gret chere. The fame of
gentil ioseph sprang gretly, and aroos To alle þe lordis of egipt land,
with gret reuerence; And when he was come into þe cuntre of helinpoleos,
 He sende xii wyse to putiphar preest, seiynge in sentence,
"Greteth the wel oure sire ioseph, and noteth yn aduertence, To dyner at
midday to thi hous, he cometh for his cumfort, In the shade fro the
sunne, to take þere his disport."
And putifar, plesed plesantly, sayd with woise ioiynge, "Blessed
be the lord god of Ioseph, þat my noble sire Ys comyng toward my hous,
to me yt is plesyng." He called þe prevost of ys hous, & sayd, "I the
require, Make redi a grete feste, and most deynteus to desire, And
gouerne it goodly, I the charge, in þi beste aray, For ioseph þe
strong man of god schal come to vs this day."
Then herde asneth þat her fadir & her modir bothe Wer come in hervest
fro the feeld of here heritage And sayde, "with ioye I schal go, and se
hem forsothe;" And hasted here forth busyly, agayns hem in passage,
 Clothed comely in bright byse , lykyng to her lynage, And wrought with goold of iacint, a
girdel of goold þer to, With armillis 
aboute here handis, and here feet also.
A bie of bright burned goold aboute here nekke
was bent Pyght ful of preciouse stonys, & graue in were all The
Idolis namys of egipt, plesant to here entent,


 

And aboue here hed was sett a riche coronall, That constreyned here fair
frount, þat was so virginall, Here hed was couered with terestre, & went
forth with plesance And haileed here fadir & here modir, with comely
cunte∣nance. 
Ful curteysly sche kyste hem, and gretly gan ioye, To se here
doughter so honestly, in riche ornature. The deyntevus frutes of þe
feld, to here þei dide emploie, That delicious were and
delectable, & noble in nature. Þe mayde reioysed of the frutes, þat were
ful mature, Of figes, dates, pomgarnettes, & of grapes grete, Of
doue briddes, and thir frutes, þat sauery were & swete.
And putifar sayde to asneth, "The closett dore þe shitte." She did so,
and he here kiste, and saide, "my dowter dere, Novellis nowe I schall
the telle, tend now to my witte, The myhty man, ioseph, of god,
þis day wil be here, And he ys gouernour to saue egipt, by
pharao saunz pere, A maide clene as ye be, so virgine he ys speciall; I
schal marie yow to hym, & make yow his conthorall."
And when asneth had herd here fadir þise wordis reherse, With
straunge yes on hym she loked, here colour gon dis∣teyne, And seide to
hym, "why seie ye thus, my worship to reuerse, To take me caytyf to a
straunger? of hym I haue disdeyne,


 

A futif he ys, by bargayn bouht, & more I say yow pleine, That herdis
son of chanan his lady wold haue fuyled, In prison therefore he
was put, & all worshyp spuyled.
"And after yt happid þat pharao, as he lay in slepe, Dreyht was dered in his dremys, diuersely
dremyng, And then this ioseph was take out of the prison depe, To rede
hym right the redeles of his sweuenyng. The olde wyfis of egipt
han craft in þat cunnyng, And þerfore þat dreme redere I vtterly
forsake, And take me to the kyngis sone, my marie & my make." 
And as putifar with his douhter stood þus talkyng, There come on of his
meyne, and þus to hym saide, "Ioseph ys come to youre gatis, I do
yow to wytyng." Anf when he spak of ioseph, anon asneth the mayde
Ascended to here cenacle, to the wyndow sche here braide, Þat lay
estward in the chambir of here statly tour,— To se ioseph, for hir fadir
of hym spak gret honour. 
And putifar went forth with his wyf & with his kynrede, To mete with
ioseph, þat gentil Iuge, as man þat was sage; He commaunded þe porteris
sone þe gatis up to sprede, And in entred Ioseph þanne, upon þat
terrage, Standyng on pharaos secunde chare, statli opon stage, 
With foure stronge stoute stedis, þer inne were drawyng, That were white
as the snow, and prowd of here likyng.


 

Þe briddes were fineli gild, the trais of noble atire, Ioseph clothed
was al in white, couered with purpure palle, Wrought with branches of
bright byse, contexit with goold wire, A coroune of goold on his
heed, þat riche was and rialle, And in þe cercle þerof were sette twelf
stonis imperialle, And aboue the saide stonis, twelf sterris of goold
pure, With a sceptir in his hand, that noble was in nature.
A braunche with beries of oliue tree, in hand he bar with alle,
Ful plenteus it was of frut, þerin was gret fatnesse; Then entered
Ioseph In at the gatis, & cam in to þe halle, And þe peple was voided
sone, with gret busynesse; The porteris shitte þe gatis faste, with
moche hastynesse, And putifar, his wyf, and his kynred, with worthi
gouer∣nance, Except asneth, honoured ioseph with obeisaunce.
Ioseph descended of his chaar, glorious to beholde, And tok hem on his
right syde, thankyng in noble wyse. Grett ioye there was mad, among yong
& olde, Save when asneth saw ioseph, here sorwe gan arise, Here
spirites failed, here bodi trembled, his noblei to dis∣pise, "Alas,"
sche saide, "I haue misdo, dispisyng þis nobil man, When I called hym
herdis sone of the land of chanan."
"And nowe he cometh, as the sunne fro heuen with his bemys, Radiant
richeli in his chaar, with glorious excellence, 


 

Passyng peerles and plesant, in gouer yng of remys, With beaute
bounte he is braced, & grace of influence, Allas! that euere I dispised
hym, or made hym resistence, Godis sone, I wot, is ful noble of
alliance, And the saueour of al egipt, withoute variance. 
"Who was euer gete of a man, so fair, so fresh of face? Or what womman
myghte conceive, & bere so moche light? Of most wrecched now I am,
forfeded I haue hys grace, When I dispurned hym to my fadir, with wordis
unright. Now wyl I hide me fro his face, and kepe fro his sight, 
And yet nothyng fro hym ys hid, he hath so gret cunningge, But mercy,
gret god of ioseph, of my missayngge!
"I wolde my fadir wolde me gife to ioseph in seruice, For euer þerto I
wolde assente, to be his owen seruant." By that had ioseph wasshe his
feet, & in noble wyse A boord was laid for hym apart, þat was to
hym plesant, For with þe eqiptianis in etyng he was not conuersant, But
escheued heem in here metis, and of hem had drede, And after he spak to
putifar, thus, and to his kynrede,—
"What womman was sche þat, that in þe wyndow stod Of þe cenacle,
as I cam In? sche ys ageyns my herte, Remeveth here sone out of þis
hous, for marryng of my mod." For ioseph dred wanton wymmen, þe good man
to peruerte, Þerfore he saide, "haue her out that I may be querte." For
he was chast & virgine pure, & clene in continence, Dredyng with
fere the infeccion of femenyn insolence.


 

And for as moche as þe dowtirs of þe dukys grete of egipt wowed him ofte
tyme, to wanton wikkednesse, Þerfore he fledde here felawship, and ofte
tyme did hem þrete, Tho voyde hem fro þe presence of his pure clennesse;
 Alle faire femelis of egipt he had in heuynesse, For þei desired
to slepe with hym, he was so amiable, But he dispised hem and here
menis, in clennesse he was stable,
Ant saide, "in þe sight of gret god, of my fadir israel, I wyl not synne
in no wyse, but haue in remembrance The commaundementis of my
fadir, and euer kepe hem wel; For he bad me and my bretheren, with oute
variaunce, To kepe vs clene fro wymmen of straunge alliance, And saide,
þat here felawship wold man with deth destruye, Þerfore haue out þe
straunge womman, nothyng þat sche me nuye."
Then seyde putifar þus, "my lord, þe womman þat ye saw stande Ys non
alien, but of her Inne, and howre dowhter dere, Hatyng þe cumpanie of
alle men; & more I take an hande, Sche ys virgine pure and clene,
þerfore I pray yow here, That sche may come to yowr presence, & haile
yow with good chere." And ioseph, gretly ioied, þen, for þat
putifar saide Þat sche loued no man flesly, but lyued a clene maide,
"Þat sche ys a maide," quod ioseph, "I loue here the more, And as myn
own sister, ful wel sche pleseth me; Lett here come anon to me." here
modir went here fore, 


 

And brouhte here to his presence, þat maide fair & fre, Here fadir saide
to here, ful sone, "dowhter, I charge the Salu þi brother, a maide as
þow, of dede & purpos pure, Hatyng alienes & vnclene wymmen, as þu in
thi nature."
Then asneth, nurshid nobely, on knes fair hym grette, And said,
"hail lord, blessed of god, hie heuene kyng." And ioseph answered,
gentilly, hys wordis to her he sette, "Blisse þe maide þe grete god, þat
quikketh al thyng." Þan said þe fadir, "go kis þi brother, dowhter, on
my blessyng." And asneth wente to kysse hym, after here fadir hestis,
 But ioseph streight his right hand out, & layd yt on here brestis.
And sayd, "sothly, unsemyng and unsittyng hit ys, To the man þat schulde
serue god, and with his mouth hym blesse, And ete the blessed brede of
lyue, and drinke of his chalis, Ony womman alien, or straunger for to
kesse, Þat blysse mamettis with here mouth, & idolis in liknesse,
That are bothe dumbe and dede, & ete brede of here bord, Ony swych
womman for to kysse, hit lyketh not god my lord.
"But the man þat worshipeth god his modir kysse he schal Hys sister, his
wyf, & his kyndrede, & make hem god chere." . . . . . .
Ioseph sayd, "I wil departe upon þis same day, For in þis day god bygan
alle his creature,


 

And here after eyhte dayes, sothly as I þe say, I schal retourne, and
dwelle here, & perto do my cure." Putifar thanne, and his kynrede, with
humblesse of nur∣ture, Toke at hym his bien aille, with ful
gentil langage, And so dide Ioseph at hym, & toke forth his viage.
And asneth abood, soul, alone, with seuen virgines clene, &, greued with
sorwe, sche wepte sore, to the sunne siled west, Bred ne
water wolde sche noon, by no maner mene. When nyht cam, alle þei
slepte, & wente to here rest Saue asneth, wakyng allone, lay knockyng
nere brest. For sche hadde take ful gret drede, & shok with tremblyng,
Sche was constreyned so with sorwe, þat caused here mournyng.
& then sche roos fro here bed, & cam fro her chamber doun, The
gatis wher portere & his men slepte sure, And to wyndowe faste by sche
busked here ful boun, & there sche drow out a large skyn for here
couuerture, And filde þe skyn ful of askes, and after by aventure Sche
ascended in to here chamber, the doris fast barryng, And lay doun
on the pavement, and syhed with waylyng.
A virgine, þat asneth loued most, herde of here sobbyng, Alle sixe
virgines here felawys anon sche gan up rere, Þei wente to the chambir
dore, & herde here syhyng, Þei founde the dore lokked faste, þei myhte
hit not vnspere; Werefore þei cried with vois echon, & callid on
here there,


 

And sayde, "madame what ailes you, and ys your nuysance?"
Asneth opened not here dore, but sayde in þis wyse, "Mi heed yt aketh
 grevusly, on bed þerfore I lye, I am so sik in al my
membris, þat I may not rise, To open the dore goth fro me; to
your chambres you hie." Þei passed forth as sche bade, and ansneth (sic)
privelye Com to þe chamber where here robis pressed were well, And drow
to here a blacke robe, a cloth of sorwe & deell.
That schee had mad for þe deth of here yungger brother; With þis
cloth into here chamber sche returned sone, And schytte the dore with
barre & bolt, at trauers upon othir, & in haste dide of here robe, with
ful moche mone, (Þe riall was with bise & goold ful preciously bygone,)
And so sche did here ceynte of goold, þat riche was of valour, 
And did on her þe blake robe, þe vesture of dolour.
Þe coronall þat couered her hed, in the pavement sche yt laide; Here
byes als and bracelettes of riche orfeoure, & in the north part of the
chamber to a wyndow sche brayde, And threw hem out by & by, þat noble
were of feiture, Here garmentis of goold, and girdelis of gay
garnetture, And alle here godis of goold & siluer, sche tok hem in
haste, With alle þe idolis of egipt, at the wyndow out sche caste.


 

Sche tok here souper araid fore here of wyld foul & fisshes, Þe carcais
als of fatte calfis, and of oþer sacrifice, Þe vesselis for wyne
of sacrifice, toupes, cuppis, disshes, Cast hem out to straungers
houndis, and so did hem dispise And sayde, "alas how schod my houndis
ete in ony wyse, Of this souper of sacrifice, of fals maumetrie? I take
yt þerfore to straungers houndis, & forsake al ydol∣atrie." 
And after asneth askes tok, & strewed hem in and oute Upon the pauement,
& bond her lendis with saccloth for penance, And did an heue
 upon here bodi, & bette here breste aboute With bothe handis, &
wepte sore for here ignorance, & laide here doun upon þe askes, with
teres of repentance, Sobbyn sore with moche sorwe, sett on euery
side, Al the nyth contynuyng so, til þe morwe tyde.
In the mornyng when she roos, with fen sche was fuyled, Þat with þe
teris and askis were medled so in same, Sche fil agayn flatt on here
face, here body so sche spuyled, And lay þere til hit was nyht,
asneth by here name. So sche meked here by seuen
daies, þat noble worthi dame, Þe eyhte day þe cokkys crew, þe day bygan
to sprynge, The mayde a lytel lefte up here heed, ful faynt of fastynge.
Aftir she roos on here knees, feble sche was and feynt, 


 

And lifte up here heed a lite, & syhed wondir sore; The maide was meked,
& made megre, & with sorwe atteynt To a wyndow þat lay estwarde sche
dressed here þerfore, & sette here doun undir yt, and saide, "ha lord
thyn ore! What schal I do? were may I go? were schal I haue refute?
 Desolate maide in deserte, of cumfort destitute.
Mi fadir, my modir, & my kyn, þei wel me haue in hate, For I haue
disparplid al her goodis, & cast hem vnderfote, And forsake me for here
douhter, & with me debate, Who may deliuere fro þis daunger, my balis
who may bote? Yett more ouer in my mynde, with sorwe I mark &
note, Þat al my louers þat me wowed, I hated in alle uyse, Now may þei
glade on my myschief, & utterly me dispise.
"But þe heyhe lord god of ioseph, almyghti in his trone, He ys Ielous
upon his peple, hatyng al idolatrie, Þerfore, dredful lord, to
þe, now make I my mone, For I haue worshiped fals godis, & mortal
mamettrie, Of here sacrifices I have ete; mercy þerfore I crie, For the
lord god of hebreis ys trewe & mercyable, Long abydyng, mylde and meke,
on hem þat be unstable. 
"He repreueth no maner man, that turneth hym with penance, Þerfore I wil
returne to hym, & fro me synne chace, I wil forsake al my synnes, and
after to his plesance, Yete out my praieres in his siht, & to
his loue me brace, And yf þat I be repentant, he wil tak me to grace,
 For he is protectour, and defendour, of fadirles children∣alle,
Þerfore to his grete mercy I shall clepe & calle."


 

And þan sche roos out of the place, þer sche satt & stood, To þe
wyndows, þat to þe est parties hadde here regard; And saide, "lord god
of al rightful, þat madest land & flood, That inspirest al wysdam
in hertis þat ben hard, And makyst þynggis inuisible apparent afterward,
Þat hast enhanced heuen an high & stablyd yt aboue the wyndes, & foundid
land upon þe wateris, as creatour to al kyndes,
"That hast made þe stonis grete, & wateris of hyght depnesse,
Conseruyng kyndly þi priaptis, , and to þi vois
obeisant, Þei wyl nawt offende þi maundementis, for in sekirnesse To al
lyuyng creatures þi word ys lyf plesant, Þerfore I flute, 
lord, to þe, thyn humble suppliant, Crying to þe with my prayer,
in thyn hihe presence, Confessyng to the, my grete synnes, &
schewe þe my offence.
"Synnyng, lord, I haue synned, ful gretly in þi syght, & worsheped
idolis & maumettis agayns þi mageste, Þerfore to open my mouth to þe,
unworthy I am by right, O lord god, summe tyme I was a proud lay of
degre, Preferrid in richnesse aboue alle oþer, in worship gret
plente I hadde, but ful desolate and destitute I am forsake, Werefore,
lord, I fle to the, to þi mercy I me betake.


 

"And as þe infaunt, þat sothly soketh his modir breste, For drede fleeth
to the fadyr, to haue of hym socour, So, lord, I sprede out my
handis, to þe ys al my treste, Take me, lord, & calle me to the, & helpe
me with þi fauour, For þe dwell, þat wod lyoun, will rauesshe me with
errour, For he is fadir of fals godis of al egipt lande, But I haue cast
hem fro me, & destruyed hem with my hand.
Deliuere me, lord, fro his powere & fro his mouth me drawe, Lest on
happe he rauesshe me ant sle me, þat grett whale, That ys acursyd
eternally, by the sentence of þi lawe. Receyue me, lord, for fadir &
modir refuse me with bale, And seyn, 'asneth is not our douhter,' to
grete & to smale, 'For sche hath destruyed our godis of goold, &
gyfe hem in conculcacioun, To alle men passyng by þe way in gret
abhominacioun.'
"Werefore I fle to þe, my god, þat art of myhtes most, Deliuere me, &
spare me, lord, I haue synned by ignorance. When I called thi child
ioseph, in dispite with my goost, The heerdis sone of chanan, in
pride of my bobaunce; And now he is aboue alle men, withoute variaunce,
For he þe knoweth for on god, veray lord and trewe, Þerforeþu hast gyfe
wytt to hym, wisdam & vertue.
"Now, good lord, take me to hym to be his hand maide, And I schal
wassche louly hys feet, subdue me to his seruage, Lernyng þe knowlych of
veray god;" when sche þus had said,


 

The sterre lucifer in þe est shewed his visage, And þerof asneth was ful
glad, & seide in here langage, "Trowest not god hath my prayer herd, þe
messager lo of lyht Is rise up!" & sodeynly sche saw a selcouth
siht.
Sche saw faste by þe sterre, how heuene partyd in two, & a wondir ful
gret liht lemed out in þat stede, And asneth ferd fel on here face, on
þe askes tho, And a man com doun fro heuen, & stood upon here heed,
 Callyn asneth by here name; sche answered not for dred, And he
called here the secounde tyme, & saide "asneth! asneth!" Then sche
answered, "lo, my lord, & þerwith sche took breth,
And saide, "tel me who þu art," & he answered in haste, "I am a prince
of godis hous, & of hys heuenly ost, Arise, and stand on thi
feet, & be nothyng agast, And my wordis schal speke to the to cumfort of
þi gost." Sche lyfte þen here heed, & saw a man like almost Ioseph, with
scepter, stole, & coroune, his cheer as lyhtyng leem, & his yes bright
shynyng as doth þe sunne beem. 
The heris of hys heed, þei were as flame of fire brennyng, And asneth,
frayd of þe syhte, fel to his feet for fere, In so moche þat al here
membris were meved with tremb∣blyng. And the aungel saide þenne,
"asneth, nothing the dere. 


 

Be þu cumforted, an rise up, & on þi feet þe rere, And I schal
speke my wordis to þe after myn entent." And asneth roos upon here feet
at his commaundement.
The aungel saide to asneth, "do of þi blak haire, & thi garnement of
drede, þe saccloth do away, Smyte þe askes fro þi heed, & washe þi face
faire, & þi handis with rennyng water; do on þi riche aray, Þi
lynnen robe, untouched newe, þat glorious ys & gay, & gird the with þe
double ceynt of þi virginite, And then com to me agayn, & I schal speke to the."
Asneth hasted forth anon & did as he desired, And caste on þe
white robe with precious parementis, With double ceynt gird aboute, &
diuersly atired Aboue þe brestis, & on þe lendis gird on here
garnementis, A lynen newe theustre vail
with riche ornamentis, Here hed was voluped with þat vail, for virginal
excellence, And returned to þe aungel, & stood in his presence.
Þe aungel saide, "lai don þi wail, discouere þi hed in haste, Why dost
þu thus? þu art maide, þin heed is fair to se, As the heed of a
yonglyng," þe wail away sche caste, The aungel said, "asneth, maide, of
good chere þu be, Oure lord hath herd þi prayer & þi confession
fre; This fast he saw of vij dayes, & þi lou mekyng, And þe fen, mad of
the askes and of þi gret teryng.
"Be glad, virgine, for þi name ys write in þe book of lif, And schal
neuer de don away, but ay in remembrance, 


 

Lo fro þis day þu art renuwed & quicked fro al strif, And þu schalt ete
of blessyng bred & hue drinke of plesance, Þu schat be enoynted with
holi creme of glorious purveance, And, more, I gif þe in to wyf to
ioseph my dere frend, And ioseph into þi spouse in wordle with oute end.

"And þi name schal be called asneth no more, But hit schal be moche-of-
refute, & so men schul þe calle, For peple schul turne to good by the, I
warne þe bifore, And undir þi wynggis þei schul be couered, tristyng in
god alle, And attendyng to þe hiest god schul be kept in þi walle,
 For thi penaunce hath prayd to hym for þe euery hour, And upon
alle other penantes, in godis name with dolour.
"For penance ys þe dere douhter of hiest god in heuene, And entendyng
upon maidenes and loueþ you gretly, And praieth for you euery hour to

mekly, Yt makeþ maidenes to reste in heuene in place arayd sikerly, &
renoueleþ virgines clene to goddis dere blessyng, & purchaceþ (?) ham ioye and
blisse in wordlis withoute endyng.
"Penaunce is a maide good, glad, and mesurable, The hiest god
hath here in lond, his angelis in reuerence, I loue here wel, now schal
I go, with oute ony fable, To ioseph, & telle of þe the wordis of my
sentence, And he schal come þis dai to the, & see thyn excellence, And
with ioye loue þe weel, thi spouse be he schall, & wedded wyf to
hym in wordlis eternall.


 

"& now here me, asneth, maide; do on þi garnementis Of weddyng now in þi
chambre, and atire the with all, And enbclise þi bright beaute, with
preciouse ornamentis, & go forth to mete ioseph, thi spouse speciall,
 For he schal come & see þe, to day, in vesture imperiall." And
after he had endyd his word, asneth, with consolacion, Worshiped hym do
on þe erthe, & said in comendacion,
"Blessed be þi god, most hiest, þat thus þe hath sent, & deliuered me
fro derknesse, & depnesse of my bale, Blessed euer be his name,
lord god omnipotent." & to þe angel afterward þise wordis sho gan
availe, "What is þi name? tel me sone, & give yt me in tale, Þat I mai
worship & thanke þe, my lord & my frend, & glorifie þi grete name, in
wordle with out ende." 
The angel saide, "my name is write in godis book in heuen, With godis
fynger fore al othir in the bokys bygynnyng, For I am þe prince of godis
hous, & so I tel þe euen, Þat al þat writen is in þat boke, hit passed
mannys spekyng, Inconuenient þerfore yt ys, to eche man vnsyttyng,
 To commune or to here of hem, that are celestiall, For þei be
gret fro mannys mynde, and wonderfull with all."
Thenne seide asneth, "good lord, lat me fynde grace, Þat I mai knowe þat
yt be do, þat þu hast said to me, Gyf thyn handmaide leve to speke in
presence of þi face." The angel said, "spek on, asneth, þi bone I
graunte the," And sche tok hym by the palle, & said with vois ful free,


 

"I pray the, lord, to sitte a while upon þis bed so clene, For man ne
womman satt neuer þeron by no maner mene.
"And I schall make a bord redy, and offre to your plesir, Breed
and wyn fro my celer, ful swete & redolent, And when ye haue ete, &
drynke, þen aftir your desire, Ye mai folwe forth your way after your
entent." The aungel saide, "bring yt sone, þerto I consent." And asneth
sette a newe bord with businesse & haste, And went to fette breed
& wyne plesant to his taste.
The aungel said, "a hony combe bring þu me ful sone." And for sche had
non redy sche stood al dismaid. Sche saide, "I schal send a chyld in to
the feeld anone Of hour heritage, to fette on, sone yt schal be
rayd." "Entre in to þi celer," the aungel to here saide, "And thu
schalt fynde an hony comb redy on the bord, Take and bryng yt to me;"
and asneth sayd, "my lord,
Knowyth wel þer is non, in no maner of wyse." "Entre þi celer," quod þe
aungel, & on þer schalt þu fynde." Sche entred in, an hony comb
sche fond of a gret assise, Also white as þe snowe, clene & pure in
kynde, Of odour swete, and asneth meruayled in her mynde, And said,
"trowest not þat of þis comb, þat þis man hath ete, For þe flauour ys as
þe breeth of his mouth so swete." 
And annon sche tok þe comb and afore hym sette, The angel said, "whi
saidest þu, þer was non in þi celer? Now hast þu brouht a ful fair on,
þat was in þi recette."


 

And asneth with gret drede saide in this maner, "Lord, non swych
honycomb in gouernance hadde I there, But by commaundement of þi
mouth, so yt was do, For the odour þer of ys lik the breth of þi mouth
also."
And þe aungel smyled then, with lauhyng cuntenance, For þe wisdom of
asneth, vpon here intelligence, He called here vnto hym, his right hand
he did hance, Vpon here heed; schee loked on hym, with shame &
reuer∣ence, He gaf here þen hys benison of gracious influence. He saide
to here, "þu art blessed for þu hast left þe fay
Of alle maner fals ydolys, and beleuist in god veray.
"And blessed be thei, þat come to god in holy penance, For þei
schul ete of this comb, þat bees made of paradise, Of the dew of rosis
þere, þat are of gret plesance, The angelis of god schul ete also, þis
comb of prise, And who þat eteth of þe same schal neuer dye in no wyse."
After he brak it and ete a part of þat hony swete, The remenant
he putte in asneth mouth & bad here to ete.
The aungel saide, "lo, þu hast ete of þe bred of lyf, & þu art enoynted
with holi creme, & þi flesh fro this day Schal be renued, & þi bonys
cured from al strif, And þi vertu neuer faile, þe sothe now I the say.
 Thy Iuuent schal haue non age, þi beaute schal laste ay, Of alle
þat fle to oure lordis name, god & heuene kyng, Thu schalt be as Cite
bild of ioye, withoute endyng."


 

He touched þe comb broke with his hand, hool it was anone, He touched þe
hony with hys fynger upon þe este partie, He drow his fynger
ageyn to hym to þe west part sone, And þe way of his fynger was mad al
blodi, He drow his fynger þeron fro þe north to þe sowth surly; The way
of hys fynger þer was turned in to blood, And asneth biheld al that he
did, in his lift side sche stood. 
The aungel saide, "vpon þe comb behold & take hede," & bees come oute
þerof ful fele, & white as þe snow, Here wynges were of purpre hewe,
aboute here þei yede, & wrouthe a honycomb in her handis & ete þerof
Inow. The aungel saide þen to þe bees as I schal tel yow, "Go ye
now in to your place." þei wente toward þe est, Into paradis. þe angel
saide, "asneth, al this þu seest?"
She answered, "ye, my lord," þe aungel saide þenne, "So my wordis schul
be fulfild þat I haue said to þe." Te comb he touched with his hand,
& fire bygan to brenne, And consumed þe comb anon, not hurtyng
bord ne tre. The fragrant odour of þat brennyng yt was swete & fre.
Asneth saide, "I haue seuen maidenes on o nyght bore, With me, as my
sisteres I loue hem alle þerfore.
"To blesse hem as þu hast me afore þe I hem calle." "Calle on,"
he saide: sche called sone; þei come to his presence, The aungel saide,
"almyghti god lord blesse you alle, Be ye to þe city of refute seven
pileris in assistence, & alle dwellyng in þat Cite schul reste on your
prudence." The aungel saide to asneth þen, "þis bord awey þu dihte." 


 

Sche turned and saw like a char with foure hors passyng In heuen toward
the est like flame of fire reed, The hors assembling to þe flame, of
þunder leihtnyng Sche saw þe aungel vpon þe char standyng in þat steed,
Þat he was aungel sche was unknowe þerfore sche said with dreed,
"Alas. I haue spoke with godis aungel, haue mercy on þi hand maide, For
þe wordis I spak in þi presence in ignorance I hem saide."
And asneth yet þus spekyng, a younge man cam ful faste Of þe seruantes
of putifaris, & to here he saide, "Ioseph þe stronge man of god cometh
here in haste, His messanger ys at þe gate." and asneth forth
sche braide And stood aside in a tresance, sche was ful wel apaide,
Ioseph entred into halle, þe gatis men did spere, And
shitte out alle straungeris þat no man schul hym dere.
And asneth wente to mete ioseph out of þe tresance goyng. Ioseph
saw here & gan to wondir upon beaute bright, For sche was
chaunged & enbelised by þe angelis communyng, & ioseph saide, "who art
þu? telle me anon riht." "I am þi handmaide," quod sche, "to þi
commaundement diht, And alle mamettis I haue do away, & utterli forsake,
 Þe aungel of god fedde me today & heuenly fode me take,


 

And saide, 'I haue gyfe þe today wyf unto Ioseph, And he schal be thi
spouse, in the wordle withoute ende; & saide my name, schulde no more be
called asneth, But Cite of refute and þi lord god schal þe sende, 
'Moche peple þat þu schale turne & to almyhty god wende' He saide me
more, 'to ioseph forth now schal I passe, And speke þise
wordis in his eris, of þe more & lasse.'
"Now þu knowyst, my lord Ioseph, yf þe aungel cam to þe, And spoke to þe
of me the wordis þat I shewe." Þen ioseph sayde, "of hiest god,
asneth, blessed þu be, & þi name, in kynredis blessed of kynredes schal
renewe, For god of heuen loued þe & send me his angel trewe, & spake of
the to me þise wordis; & þerfore, maide com ner, What ys þe cause þu
standist fro me now so fer?" 
And ioseph streihte out his hand, & loueli gan her brace, Þei kiste þen
bothe in same with cuntenance excellent, Then saide sche, "my lord
Ioseph, entre into oure place." Sche ladde hym in by þe right hand, here
fadir was absent, Sche broughte water to wasse his feet, with ful trewe
entent, And he asked anoþer maide to whasshe ys fete þere, And
asneth saide, "I schal hem wasshe, ye ar my lord dere,
"Fro hennys forth I am þin awne þi handmaid & þi thrall, Whi askest þu
anothir maide to wasshe þi feet here? Thi feet ar myn owne feet, þi
handdis also with all, And þi soule ys my soule, þu are thn myn
owne fere." Sche constreyned hym & weesh hys feet with ful good chere.


 

And he behold here faire handis of beaute þer was no misse He tok here
by þe right hand and louely did here kysse.
He made here þen sitte by hym vpon his right hand; Here fadir
here modir & here kynreed com out of þe feld Of here heritage, and
wondering stil thei gan stande. The glorious beaute of here douhter
mervaillus þei beheld. Thei saw here sitte with ioseph, reuerence to hym
þei yeld. More þei mervailed þat sche wered on þe stole of here
wed∣dynge, And after þei ete & drinke togedir, gretly enioynge.
Then saide putifar to ioseph, "to morwe I schal calle Alle þe
gouernouris of pharoa and princes of egipt lande, And make espousailes
vnto you, my douhter take þu schalle, Vnto þi wyf." þen saide ioseph,
"thu schalt vnderstande, I schal go myself tomorwe, and þat werke
take on hande, & speke to pharao of egipt kyng, my fadir of gret honour,
Of al his land he hath me mad chief prince & gouernour.
"And I schal speke in his eris of asneth plesantly, And he schal yeve
here me to wyf with solempnite." Then said putifar, "go forth
with pees ful obeisantly," But with putifar he dwelled al nyght with
tranquillite, And with asneth sclepte he not, but said in verite "His is
no right þat a man þat wirshipeth god an hihe Afore espousailes in no
wyse with his wyf to lye." 
Ioseph ros vp tymely, to kynge pharao he goes, And said, "graunte me to
wyf asneth, þe maide reuerent,


 

The douhter of preest putifar of olinpoleos." & pharao saide, "to þe,
ioseph, Þe maide is congruent, For sche is a maide clene as thu, tak to
her to þin entent. Be sche to þe þi dere spouse in wordle
euerlastynge." And pharao send to putifar his douhter forth to bringe.
Afore pharao asneth stood in his hihe presence And he wondering on here
beaute, "endure with þe For ay * * * * * The rightful god of ioseph hath
chose þe his spouse today, * * * * * And ioseph is called the
sone of god of hih dignite, And þu schalt be called his owen spouse in
perpetuite."
Pharao þen tok hem bothe and here hedis frette With crounys of pure
gold, þat riche wer of atire, Upon þe right side of ioseph asneth þen he
sette, And laide his handis on here hedis & saide in his desire,
"Blesse you now þe lord god of þe heuenly empire, And fulfille you
eternally with glorie, ioye, and blisse." And after turned hem mouth to
mouth, & togedir did hem kysse.
And after pharao dide þe weddynges to be solempnised, Callyng
alle princes and gouernours of egipt land þerto, A rial feste by seuen
dayes during was deuised, And pharao declaret a newe decree to alle hys
land also, Sayngge, "what man þat ony werke euer here after do In the
day, þat ioseph & asneth were wedded inne, Thei schul dye in
grevus deth, for that gret synne."
And after Ioseph knewe his wyf sche conceived sone, And bar manasses &
effraim, þis was here procreacion,


 

And aftir asneth seurly to god sche mad here mone, Remembering here olde
synne by prive meditacion, And after mournyng þus sche saide,
 with gret lamentacion, "Lord, synned I haue
synned, moche synned in þi presence, Asneth, dowhter of putifar, pardone
myn offence.
"Most foulest in my fadir hous I was of gouernance, A maide enhansed &
right proud, I haue synned, lord, to þe, Fals godis herid with
oute nombre to my daliance, & ete bred of her sacrifice so synned in þat
degre, Synned, lord, I haue synned in þi sihte fre, & ete of bord of
pestilence, bred þat is straungling, & dranke of þe chalis of defaute in
þi presence synnyng. 
"And of the lord of heuene I was ignoraunt, Not tristyng in þe hihe god
þat art lyf eternall; I haue synned, lord, in þi presence, my synne is
displiant. For I triste on my richesse & my beaute with alle, I haue
synned, lord, lift up with pride, confesse so I schall, I was
dispisyng euery man on erthe with errour, Ther stood neuer man in my
presence þat I gaf fauor.
"Alle my woweris I dispised, of hem I hadde disdeyn. Synned, lord, I
haue synned in presence of þi face, For I saide, þer was no prince with
glorie þat was veyn Þat þe girdel of my maydenhed was worthi to
vnbrace. I willed to marie þe kyngis sone, so proud was my trace,
Synnyng, lord, I haue synned contynuyng in þi presence, Til ioseph þe
myhty man of god tok me with excellence,


 

"For as þe fyssh by the hook ys take by distresse, So ys beaute
drow me to hym by vertuus prouydence; And ladde me to almighty god with
gret gentylesse, And did me taste of þe drynke of he
eternal sapience, And now I am mad his conthorall by his aduertence Ay
to dwelle with hym in wordle with oute ende, Synned, lord, I haue
synned remission þu me sende."
And after seven yeer were passed of plentevus abundance Þer bygunne
seuen yeer of hunger scars & chere, And Iacob herd of Ioseph, and with
gret plesance, He com into egipt land with his kynrede in fere, 
In the secunde monthe the secunde yeer when vitaile was dere, The on and
twenti day of þe monthe, Israell cam don then And descended with his
kynred into þe land of iessen.
Then saide asneth to ioseph, "the fadir I schal go se, For a god he is
to me, þi fader israel." & ioseph saide, "to se hym com now forth
with me." And þei com to iacob to þe land of iessen well. And ioseph
bretheren mette hem with reuerence & reuell; Þei wirshiped hym, don upon
þe erthe louely obeyng, Thei entred in to iacob where was his loggyng.

Israel sittyng on his bed, old & of gret age, Asneth saw hym & meruailed
for iacob was good in sight, Of hys age ful reuerent, as youthe of fair
parage, His heed white as þe snow, his berd to þe brest right, Al white
was sittyng, and his yees schynyng as liht, 


 

Hys synewes schuldirs & his armes were stable & vailant, Hys knes
schynys ant his feet like to a geaunt.
And asneth salued hym on here knes with humble conte∣nance, Then said
iacob to ioseph, "my sone thy wyf þis is?" He said, "ye." þan iacob this
wordis to here gan vance, "Blessed be thu, doughter of hiest
god," & after he did here kys. And after þei ete & drunke togedir, with
gret ioy & blys, And þenne Ioseph & asneth afore hem were sente.
In the right side of asneth was leuy in assistence, And symeon þe
left partie wente by & by, & asneth loued leuy wel for hys intelligence.
And after as sche in pharaois hous walked plesauntly, Pharaois sone
beheld here as he loked an hy, Þat was his firste bygeten child, his
sone & his here. Anon he brente on here for loue, her beaute was
so fair.
Wherefore he languyshed for loue, & nyste what to do. But sone he sente
messagers to symeon & leui, Þat were þe bretheren of ioseph, & thus said
hem to: "I knowe wel þat ye are men stronge and mihty, And meny a
sichym ye han slayn with swerd manfully, And now I pray you tenderly for
to helpe me, I schal you gife goold & siluer & men gret plente.
"Seruantis assis & chamelis to youre lote schal falle I warne you þat to
your brother I haue gret enuye, For he hath asneth to his wyf,
ordeyned me first of alle.


 

Þerfore asneth now to me, on my swerd schal he dye, Asneth to spouse þen
schal I haue I tel you trulye. Then schal I take you as my brethere
tristy & trewe And yf ye dispise my cunseil sore ye schul yt rewe. 
"For my swerd ageyns you þen schal I araye." Then spak leui unto hym
with riht bolde chere, "Wherto speketh my lord þise wordis us to afraye?
We are men þat worship god, ant oure fadir dere Ys þe child of his god
and our brother in al manere Ys dredyng gretly god, thi word hou
schul we do? To synne so in godis presence & oure fadirs also.
"Therefore heer now my wordis & do not þyn entent, For howre brother tok
here not of his owen acceptance, But by the lawe of thi fadir & of his
consent, And yf þu dwelle in þi purpoos of wykked purueance, Oure
swerdis, lo, in our handis wyt þe in variance, In þi presence with oure
brother ful redi for to dye." And when pharaois sone herd þis, he dred
hem gretlye.
Then symeon and leui went out fro his presence, And pharaois sone
was replete with sorwe, drede, & ire. To iniure he dradde ioseph for his
gret prudence. Yet on þe beaute of asneth his corage was a fire, His
meyne þen saide unto hym, to plesance of his desire, "Lo þe sonys of
handmaides to rachell & to lye, Of bale and of zelphe to ioseph
haue envye.
"Þei wil be redy to do þi wil;" & forth þei were fett, & pharaois sone
vnto hym þen did hem calle,


 

& saide, "lo, here lyf and deth afore your face ys fett. Taketh þe lyf
and not þe deth, I cunseyl you with al. I herde ioseph sey to my
fadyr, þat ye wer children þral 'And not my bretheren, I abyde hem
vtterly to destruye After the deth of my fadir & al here generacion nuye,
Thei schul neuer enherite with vs, þe sonis of seruage, Þise solde
 me to þe Ismalitis, I schal yelde he malice, Þat
þei maligned ageyns me in here gret outrage.' My fadyr pharao preised
hym & said þat he was wyse And saide 'I schal werke with þe after þi
deuyse.' And after þei hadde herde þise wordis of þe sone of pharao, Þei
said troubled gretly "lord schal we do?" 
He saide, "my fadir pharao I schal sle þis nyht, For he is as fadir to
ioseph & loueth hym gretly, And ye youre brother ioseph to deth ye schul
dyht, Þen schal I haue asneth to wyf, þat fair is & louely, & ye schul
haue part of myn heritage as my brethre tristy. Þen saide þe
bretheren Gad & dan, "þi men lord we be, What þu cumaundis hit schal be
do & more we telle þe.
"We herde ioseph to asneth saie to morwe þu schal go Into felde of
howere heritage for now is heruest seson And commaundet six hundred men
to passe with here also, Commaunde vs, lord, mo fihtynge men þat
we may by reson Go afore hem on þe nyht & leye a bushment with treson,
Bi the brook & hide vs þere in the spers of þe redis, And tak with the
fyve hundred archeris what so euer nedis,


 

"And go afore vs a good way fert out in lengthe, And asneth with
ynne our bushment þen come schalle, & we schulle sle here men echon, þat
be with here by strenthe, And asneth wil fle on here char & in our
handis falle, Þu schalt parfourme þen þi wil and thi desires alle, Then
schul we ioseph & hys children sle byfore þi ye." When pharaois
sone þise wordis herde, he enyoyed gretly
And sende to hem two þousand þat armed were briht, Þei wente and hidde
hem by þe broke in þeed slily, & pharaois sone roos up
on the same nyht, And com to his fadir chamber to entre in prively.
 His fadir wacche forbad hit hym, & told þe cause why, "Thi fadir
hed of wacche it aketh & now reste hath take, He forbad entre to euery
man þat non scholde hym wake."
And when he herde þise wordis he departed þan, And toke five hundred
archiris, afore þe gate he wente, After þat þat yt was spoke
bothe by gad ant dan. And asneth aros tymely to ioseph sche here mente,
"I go to þe feld of oure heritage after þyn entente, But sory dredeth
now my soule þat we schul parted be." Ioseph said "dred nothyng, for god
is with þe, 
And schal kepe the fro al disese, as þe appel of þe ye, For I schal go
and gif bred to þe land aboute." And bothe þenne þei toke here way, &
asneth cam bye Vpon the brook, and six hundred men with here in a route,
And sodeynly the husment brake on hem a shoute, And slowe hem
ful cruelly in þe egge of the swerde, And beniamin fledde with asneth
 on here char aferd.


 

A man þer scaped away, þat was with asneth there, And told leui and his
brother in haste of the afrai. Men of armes þei tok forth, hors,
harneis, and geer, & after asneth quicly thei folwed on the way,
And sone in haste þei come there þat þe busment lay, And fille on hem
sodeinly, & gaf hem dethis wounde, Gad & dan entred þe redis & hid hem
þat stounde.
Beniamyn, abydyng with asneth, saw pharaois sone com on To sette
hand upon here, þerof he was war, In the lift side of þe sculle he smote
hym with a ston, Þat fro his hors with þe same to þe grounde he hym bar,
As good as ded þere he lay, he gaf hym swych a scar. His horsmen and
archeris when þei saw þat siht, Þei fledde to þe redis & hidde
hem þer right.
When beniamyn saw symeon & leui comynge He was glad, and gaf asneth
wordis of good chere, And after þei assembled ful gretly enioynge
Askynge after gad and dan yf þei sawe hem there, Willyng to haue
slayn hem with purpos entere, But asneth saw þei souhte her brether to
sle hem in rage, And myldely with softe wordis her wath sche gan swage.
"Ye schal not now do þis þynge, youre brethere þei be, Of the kynde of
youre fadir and yf ye slowe hem so, Ye schulde be repref to alle
men tristeþ to me, And make your fadir sori & sette his hert in wo." And
when sche hadde þus said her ire swaged tho, Aftir þei tok up pharaois
sone, þe blood fro hym wasshyng, And sette hym on a hors, his wondis
softe byndyng; 


 

Þen þei laidede hym to hys fadir, & told hym more & myn. Pharao thanked
gretly god þat he was not slayn, Þe þridde day he was ded be þe wounde
of beniamin, And pharao sorwed sore for hym and gretly did complayn, And
þat sorwe with sikenesse so sore gan hym constrayn Þat pharao
dide in þe age of nynty & nyne yeer, Leuynge his kyngdom to ioseph þat
was hym leef & deer.
Ioseph regned nobeli þere wyth gret prosperite Fourty yeer and eyht, ful
graciously gouernynge, And after he gaf his diademe to pharaois sone
fre, Þat was at his fadir deth at þe brest soukyng, And ioseph
was called in egipt fadir to þe kyng. Þus endeth the storie of asneth to
youre remembrance, My rude translacion I pray you tak hit with plesance.

þu dost siluestrise, And ladies likyng thu sleest out of seson, And
reuest hem here ryalty with þi reprise, Thyn insaciable malice who may
acomplise? When þat loueli ladies thu leyest so lowe And here bright
beaute þu blemishest in a throwe. 
For þi malice me semeth reames sholde arise, To destruye cruell deeth,
and do hym of dawe— But oon wynked on me then "war quod þe wyse, And
cesse of þi sentence for symple is þi sawe, For deeth vniuerselly the
worlde schal vengyse, So ys the tyraunt tytled to that uictorie,
By adam the alderman of old auncetrie."
Then sorwed I that sentence recouered by assise, And mourned for my
maystresse here marred in molde. There ys countour ne clerk bounte can
decyse, In vertu here wommanhed was volupid many folde. Discreet,
devoute, diligent, deeth, thu mayst agrise To represse so noble, so
gentill a creature, In tendir age vntymely agayn the ordir of nature.
O myghty lord, wos goodnesse neuer schal fynyse, Haue mercy on
the soule of my dere maistresse. The fendis power fro that soule chare &
chastise. Deliuere here, gracious lord, fro peyne and distresse. Endowe
here in thi place of plesaunt paradise,


 

And receyue here blyssed lord upon thi right side, In they blysse
eternally wyth the to abyde.
Of lordis lyne & lynage sche was, here sche lyse, Bounteuus benigne,
enbleshed with beaute, Sage, softe, and sobre, an gentyll in al
wyse, Florishyng and fecunde with femenyn beaute, Meke, mylde,
and merciful, of pite sche bar þe prise. Comely, kynde, and curteis, in nobleye
of nurture, Vernant in alle vertu, plesaunt and demure.
Here the manuscript ends.
