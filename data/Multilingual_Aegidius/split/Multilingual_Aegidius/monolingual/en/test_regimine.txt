For we make þis book £for lore of kynges £and of princes þat þei mowe riƷtfulliche £and streigt rewle þe puple þat is vnder hem, £for leuyng riƷtful £rewelyng is ido tiraundise £and wrong to sogettes £and not desire þe comyn profit. £ÞeiƷ we haue declared by £manye weyes by þynges £þat ben iseid £þat it is euel £and perelous to a kyng £to do tiraundise £and rewle not þe puple ariƷt, £Ʒut it slewtheþ vs not to brynge newe resouns £to preue þe same. £And we wollen declare in þis chapitre £þat for manye causes sogettes arisen aƷenst tirauntes, £and for tyrauntes lif was ful perelous £and leuynge of riƷtful rewelyng, £þerfore kynges scholde £besiliche studie þat þei forsake not riƷtful rewelynge £noþer do tyraundise. 
And, v Poleticorum, þe philosofer rekeneþ sex causes £whi sogettes risen aƷenst tyrauntes. £Þe firste is for drede. £For manye ben feynt hertede, £and whanne þei dreden to moche £and trowen not to scape £and ben in | wanhope, £a‡ reseþ þerfore in oþere men £and ben imaad bolde men and hardye. £Þerfore it is iseid in a prouerbe £þat he þat chaseþ to £swyþe a ferful man maken hem hardy. £And so oþere bestes comonliche dreden man; £and but þei trowede £þat man wolde do hem harm, £þei wolde selde £oþer neuere rese on man. £Þan comonlich for drede bestes liggen in awayte on man £and reseþ on hem, £and ofte in þis wise sogettes arisen £aƷenst þe tyrant £and sleeþ hym dredyng £þat he wol do hem harme. £Þe seconde cause £wherfore sogettes risen aƷenst £þe tiraunt is for to be wroke of þe wrong £þat he doþ hem, £for it is kyndeliche to desire wreche. £Þerfore Omerus seide þat £wreche is swettere þan hony, £for it is desire of peyne for wreche. 
Þanne for it is likynge £in þat wise to desire wreche, £manye arysen aƷenste a tyraunt £and reseþ on hym £som tyme for strong wrathe £to be wroke of wronges þat he doþ. £Þe þridde, £som men arisen aƷenst a tyraunt £and sleeth hym som tyme, £for comynliche tyrauntes don þynges £wherfore þei ben despised. £For þei desiren not þe comyn profit £but bodilich likynge, £comynliche þei ben not sobre but glotons £and not chaast but lechours £and ben þerfore despised £and sone men risen on hem. £Here of we hauen ensaumple £as þe philosofer reherseth, £v Poleticorum, £of oon Sardanapallus £and of anoþer Dionysius. £For Sardanapallus £forsook þe comyn profit £and Ʒaf hym al to lecherie. £And a certeyn duk despisede hym £for his bestial lif £and resede on hym | and sclow hym. 
And so Dionisius was a tyrant £and tolde more pris of glotonye £þanne of þe comyn profit £and was despised of sogetes, £for he was as þei he were alwey dronke. £And oon Dyon seiƷ hym £as it were dronke alwey £and hadde despit of hym £and roos aƷenst hym. £Þe ferþe, men risen aöenst a tyraunt £for to haue worschep and wynnynge. £For worschep and honour is acounted most good among outward good, manye, £seynge þat a tyrant loue not þe comyne profit £and desireþ to haue honour and worschep £as þei seen £þat þe tiraunt haþ, £a reseþ on hym and sleeþ hym. 
Also manye men acounteþ money most good, £and seeþ þat þe tiraunt desireþ £not but his owne wynyng £and gaderyng of moneye £and reseþ on hym £and takeþ his tresour. £Þerfore, £v Poleticorum, £it is iseid þ£at som men reseþ on tirauntes £seyng þat þei hauen greet wynnynge and werschep. £Þe fifþe, £som men arisen aƷenst £tirauntes not for to haue þe principate £but for to be holde men of singuler dedes. 
For som men wolde haue a greet name £and doþ þerfore som wonderful and singuler dede. £And for þei acounten risynge £aƷenste a tyraunt dredful and wonderful £to þe puple, £a‡ riseþ þerfore aƷenst hym. £But as þe philosofer meneþ, £suche þat risen £aƷenst a tiraunt £for þis cause ben ful fewe; £for it nedeþ to suppose £þat þe[i] recchen not to be saued. £Þe sexte, £som men arisen £aƷenste tyrauntes £and sleeþ hem for to deliuere þe contreye of wrong £þat þei doun. £For þese causes men risen aƷenst a tiraunt. £Þanne for no risynge scholde be aƷenst a kyng £and for a kyng scholde not al|wey drede £to be slayn of his sogettes, £þei scholde most £besiliche be waar þat £he bycome not a tyrant. 
For Ʒif he doþ sogettes non wrong, £he is continent £and sobre and lyueþ not bestial lyf þat is to despisyng; £he werschepeþ gentel men £and oþere þat ben in þe regne £as heere astaat axeþ; £þei spoylen hem not noþer ouersetten hem, £but he bereþ hym in alle thinges £not as a tyraunt but as a verrey kyng; £and makeþ al men þat ben in þe regne louye hym £and bynemen hem al malice £and cause whi þei scholde rise aƷenste hym. 
Chapter XIV £TheyƷ we haue itauƷt kynges and princes £in manye chapitres £tofore þat þei do not tyrandise £but þat þei rewle here puple ariƷt, £Ʒut in þis chapitre £we wol brynge forþ oþere resons to preue £þat Ʒif kynges de- siren £þat here lordschepe dure, £þei scholde be bysyliche waar £þat þei bicome not tyrauntes. £For tyraundise and euel principate is destroyed £in mo diuers maneres £þan a riƷtful principate of a verrey kyng. £And, v Poleticorum, £þe philosofer rekeneþ þre maners £of destroynge of tyrauntes, £and seith þat tyraundise destroyeþ anoþer, £and a regne destroyeþ t[i]raundise. £Tiraundise destroyeþ itself.£ £For as it is iseid tofore, £euel destroyeth itself; £and Ʒif it is hool, £it may not be suffred. £And for wykkednesse and euel £þat is igadred in tyrantdise £it may not longe dure. £Þerfore it is iseid in Poleticis £þat þe grettere þe tyraundise is, £þe lasse tyme it dureþ, £for riƷtwisnesse saueþ citees and principate. £Wherfore whanne riƷtwisnesse is forsake, £a wey is imaade to destroye þat principate. £Þanne þe more a polocie £and ordenaunce forsakeþ riƷtwisnesse, £þe sonere 5 of it|self it is destroyed. £Þanne Ʒif kynges and princes wol £þat here lordschepe dure, £þei scholde be bisiliche war £þat þei forsake not riƷtwisnesse £noþer go out of þe wey £noþer bycome tyrauntes. 
And Ʒif it happeþ in eny wise £þat þei doun tirauntdise, £þei mote abate tiraundise £with al here myƷt. £For þe lasse þe tyraundise is, £þe more durable is þe principate. £[Þe seconde], on tiraundise £destroyeþ anoþer þat is contrarie þerto; £for þei good be not contrarie to good £for it is good in [on] wise, £Ʒut euel may be contrarie to euel £for euel is in many maner wise. £For a man may hit þe mark £but in on maner wise, £and þerfore þerinne is noon euel noþer contrarienesse. £But he may fayle of þe mark in manye maner wise; £wherfore faylynges may be contrarie, £as Ʒif þe schot is to long oþer to schort. £And so a schot ouer þe marke is contrarie to a schot £þat comeþ not fulliche to þe marke, £and a schot to fere £in þe on side £is contrarie to a schot £in þe oþer side. 
And so in oure purpos oo riƷtful principate £is not contrarie to anoþer riƷtful principate, £but a wrongful principate £is contrarie to anoþer principate wrongful. £Þanne on tyraundise may be contrarie to anoþer tiraundise £and destroye it, £as tiraundise of þe puple £is contrarie to tyraundise of an euel prince £[and on euel prince] £is contrarie to þe tirandise of anoþer euel prince. £For whanne oon prince oþer anoþer £þat is prince alone doun £tyrandise on þe puple, £[þe puple] þat is £ouersette wol not be ouer[sette] of suche a prince £[and] wolle rysen aƷenst hym ‡ and don tyraundise aƷenste hym £and putteþ hym out and sleeth hym. £Þanne is al þe puple imaad £as þei it were oo tyraunt, £wherfore | principate and tyraundise of þe puple £destroyen tyraundise of a prince. £And also tyraundise of a prince £distroyeth tirandise of anoþer prince. 
For ofte on prince is a tirant and £riseþ aƷenst another tirant £and bynemeþ hym his principate. £Þanne kynges and princes scholde be besiliche iwar £þat þei do no tyraundise, £for principate of tyraundise is destroyed in so manye manere wise. £Þe þridde, tiraundise is distroyed £not oonliche by itself oþer by oþer tyrandise £but also by a regne. £For not onliche euel is contrarie to euel, £but also good is contrarie to euel; £and <noƷt> onliche a tiraunt is contrarie to a tyraunt, £but also a kyng riseþ aƷenst a tyrant £Ʒif he seeþ £þat it is to doynge. £Þanne a tyraunt is in so manye manere periles £and his principate is destroyed in so manye manere wise. £And lordschipe of a kyng is not in so many perels £noþer is distroyed in so mani maner wise. £For þeiƷ a tirant fonde wiþ al his myƷt £to ouersette a verrey kyng, £Ʒit no verrey kyng £[greueþ a verrey kyng]; £for no good man and vertuous £purseweþ oþer good men and vertuos £but saueþ hym and helpeþ with al his myƷt. £For Ʒif enny gode men £oþer vertuos greuede good men and vertuos £þan he leueþ to be good and vertuos. £Þanne a kyng scholde be besilich iware of £tyrandise leste he fal in to þe forsaide perels.
