Othea opon the Greke may be takyn £for the wysedome £off man and woman , £and as ancient pepyll of hold tyme, £not havynge yit £at that tyme lyght of feythe, £wirchippyd many goddys, £vndyr the which lawe £be passed the hyest lordes £that hathe ben in the world, £as the reaume off Assire, £of Perse, the Grekys, the Troyens, Alexandre, the Romaynes £and many other, 
anamly the grettest philosophurs £that euer was—so £as yet at that tyme God £hade not oppenyd the ȝate off mercy, £but we Crysten men and women now £at this tyme £by the grace of God enlumynid £wyth very feyth may bryng ayene £to morall mynde the oppinyons of ancient pepyll £and thereopon many feyre allegories £may be made £—and as they hade a costom £to worchipe all thynge £the which above the comon cours of thynges £hade prerogatyue of some grace, £many wyse ladyes £in there tyme were called godesses.
And trwe it ys, £aftyr the storie, £that in the tyme £that grete Troye fflorishede £in his grete name a ful wyse ladie callede Othea, £consyderyng the ffre thought of Hector of Troye, £the which that tyme ffloryshed in vertues, £and that it be a shewynge of fortunes £to be in hym in tyme commynge, £sche sent hyme many grete £and notabil yiftys, £and namly the fayre stede £that men callyd Galathee, £the which had no felawe £in all the worlde. £And becavse that all wordly grace[s] £that a good man oughte £for to have were in Hector, £morally we may sey £that he toke theyme £by the cownsel of Othea, £the which sent hyme this pystylle.
By Othea we schall vndirstond £by the vertu of prudence £and of wysedome, £wherewyth he was arayed; £and because the Cardinal Vertues £ben necessarie to good pollicie, £we schall speke of them, £sewynge ich after othyr.
And to þe fryst we have youen £a name and takyn a maner of speche £in some wyse poetykly, £the bettyr to folewe owre matere £acordyng to the very storie, £and to owre purpoyse £we schall take some auctoritees £of ancient philosophres.
Thus we schall sey £that by the seyde lady £this present was yovyn.
Venus is a planete of heuen, £aftyr whome the Fryday is named; £and the metall £that we call tynne or pewter £is yovyn to the same.
Venus yiffeth influence £of loue and of ydylnes, £and she was a lady called soo, £the which was qwene of Cippre.
And because that [she] excedyd all women £in excellent beaute and jolynesse, £and was ryght amerous £and not stedefast in o loue, £and becawse that she yevyth influence of lecheri, £Othea seyth to the good knyght £that he make here not his godes.
This is to vndir∣stond, £that in sech lyfe he £shuld not abaundon his body ne his.
Phebe is called the mone, £off whom the Moneday hath his name; £and to hyme is yoven the metall £that we calle syluyr.
The mone resteth non oure £in a ryghte poynte £and yiffeth influens £of vnstefastenes and foly, £and therefore it is seyde £þat a goode knyght £shulde kepe hym £from which vicys.
And to this purpose Hermes seith, £"Vse wisedome and be stedefast." £Phebe is called the mone, £off whom the Moneday hath his name; £and to hyme is yoven the metall £that we calle syluyr.

CAP.
 VIII. £Þerfore now no þing of dampnacion is to hem £þat ben in Crist Jhesu, £wich wandren not aftir þe fleiȝss. £For þe lawe of þe spiritt £of lijf in Crist Jhesu haþ delyuerid me £fro þe lawe of synne, £and of deeþ. £For þat þat was vnpossible to þe lawe, £in what þing it was seek bi fleiȝss, £God sente his sone £in to þe liknesse of fleiȝssh of synne, £and of synne dampnede synne in fleiȝss; £þat þe iustifijng of þe lawe £were fulfild in vs, £þat goon not aftir þe fleiȝss, £but aftir þe spiritt. £For þei þat ben £aftir þe fleiȝss, £saueren þo þingis £þat ben of þe fleȝss; £but þei þat ben £aftir þe spiritt, £felen þo þingis þat ben of þe spiritt. £For þe prudence of fleiȝss is deeþ, £but þe prudence of spiritt £is lijf and pees. £For þe wisdam £of þe fleiȝss £is enemy to God; £for it is not sogett £to þe lawe of God, £for neþer it may. £And þei þat ben in fleiȝss, £mow not pleese to God. £But ȝe ben not in fleiȝss, £but in spiritt, £if neþeles þe spiritt of God £duelliþ in ȝou.
But if any haþ not þe spiritt of Crist, £þis is not his.
For if Crist is in ȝou, £þe bodi is deed fro synne, £but þe spiritt lifeþ £for iustifijng. £And if þe spiritt of him £þat reiside Jhesu Crist £fro deeþ duelleþ in ȝou, £he þat reisede Jhesu Crist £from deeþ shal quykene £also ȝoure deede bodies, £for þe spiritt of him £þat duelliþ in ȝou.
Þerfore, breþern, £we ben dettours, £not to þe fleiȝss £þat we lifen £aftir þe fleiȝss. £For if ȝe lifen £aftir þe fleiȝss, £ȝe shule dye; £but if ȝe bi þe spiritt sleen £þe dedis of fleiȝss, £ȝe shulen life. £For who euere ben ladde £bi þe spiritt of God, £þes ben þe sones of God. £For ȝe han not take £eftsone þe spiritt £of seruage in drede, £but ȝe han taken þe spiritt £of adopcion of sones, £in wiche we crien, Abba, fadir. £And þe þilke spiritt £ȝeldeþ wittnessing to oure spiritt, £þat we ben þe sones of God; £if sones, and eiris, and eiris of God, £and eiris togidere wiþ Crist; £if neþeles we suffren togidere, £þat also we ben glorified togidere.
And I deme þat þe passions £of þis tyme ben not worþi £to þe glorie to comynge £þat shal be shewid in vs. £For þe abiding of creature £abideþ þe shewing £of þe sones of God. £But þe creature is sogett to vanytee, not willinge, £but for him £þat made it sogett in hope; £for þe ilke creature £shal be delyuerid £fro seruage of corrupcion £in to liberte of þe glorie £of þe sones of God. £And we witen þat ech creature £sorowiþ and traueliþ £wiþ peyne til yit.
And not oonli it, £but also we vs self, £þat han þe firste fruyȝtis of þe spiritt, £and we vs self sorewen wiþ inne vs £for þe adopcion of Goddes sones, £abiding þe aȝenbijng of oure bodi.
But bi hope we ben made saaf.
For hope þat is sein, £is not hope; £for who hopeþ þat þing, £þat he seeþ? 25 £And if we hopen £þat þing þat we seen not, £we abiden bi pacience.
And also þe spiritt £helpeþ oure infirmite; £for what we shulen preie, £as it bihoueþ, £we witen not, £but þilke spiritt axiþ £for vs wiþ sorowingis £þat moun not be toolde out.
For he þat sekiþ þe hertis, £whot what þe spiritt desireþ, £for bi God he axiþ £for holie men.
And we witen, £þat to men þat louen God, £alle þingis worchen togidere £in to good, £to hem þat aftir purpos £ben clepide seintis.
For þilke þat he knew bifore, £he bifore ordeynede bi grace £to be maad lijk to þe ymage £of his sone, £þat he be þe firste bigoten £among manye briþern.
And þilke þat he bifore ordeynede to blis, £hem he clepide; £and wiche he clepide, £hem he iustifiede; £and wich he iustifiede, £and hem he gloriede. £What þanne shulen we seie to þes þingis? £If God for vs, £who is aȝens vs? £Þe wich also sparide not his owne sone, £but for vs alle bitook him, £how also ȝaf he not to vs alle þingis wiþ him? 33 £Who shal accuse aȝens £þe chosen men of God? £It is God þat iustifieþ. £Who is it þat condempneþ? £It is Jhesus Crist £þat was deed, ȝhe, £þe wiche roos aȝen, £þe wiche is on þe riȝt half of God, £and þe wiche preieþ for vs. £Who þanne shal departe vs £fro þe charite of Crist? £Tribulacion, or angwiȝss, or hungir, or nakidnesse, or persecucion, or perel, or swerd? £As it is writen, £For we ben slayne £al dai for þee, £we ben gessid as sheep of slauȝter.
But in alle þes þingis we ouercomen, £for him þat louede vs. £But I am certein, £þat neþer deeþ, £neþer lijf, £neþer aungels, £neþir principatus, £neþer vertues, £neþer present þingis, £neþer þingis to comynge, £neþer strengþe, £neþer heiȝte, £neþer depnesse, £neþer noon oþer creature £mai departe vs £fro þe charite of God, £þat is in Crist Jhesu oure Lord.
CAP. IX. £Y seie treuþe in Crist Jhesu, £Y lie not, £for my conscience beriþ wittnessing £to me in þe Holi Goost, £for greet heuynesse is to me, £and contynuel sorewe £to my herte.
For I my self desirede £to be departid £fro Crist for my breþern, £þat ben my cosyns £aftir þe fleiȝss, £þat ben men of Israel; £whos is adopcion of sones, £and glorie, and testament, £and ȝifing of þe lawe, £and seruise, and bihestis; £whos ben þe fadris, £and of wiche is Crist £aftir þe fleiȝss, £þat is God aboue alle þingis, £blessid in to worldis.
Amen. £But not þat þe word of God £haþ fallen doun.
For not alle þat ben of Israel, £þes ben Israelitis. £Neþer þei þat ben seed of Abraham, £alle ben sones, £but in Isaac þe seed £shal be clepid to þee.
Þat is to seie, £not þei þat ben sones of þe fleiȝss, £ben sones of God, £but þei þat ben sones £of biheest £ben demed in þe seed.
For whi þis is þe word of biheest, £Aftir þis tyme shal I come, £and a sone shal be to Sare.
And not oonli she, £but also Rebecca hadde twei sones £of oon liȝgging £bi of Isaac, oure fadir.
And whanne þei weren not ȝit borne, £neþer hadden doo £any þing of good eþer of yuel, £þat þe purpos of God £shulde duelle bi eleccion, £not of werkis, £but of God clepinge, £it was seid to him, £Þat þe more shulde serue þe lasse, £as it is writen, £I louede Jacob, £but I hatide Esau.
What þerfore shulen we seie? £Wheþer wickidnesse be anentis God? £God forbede.
For he seiþ to Moises, £Y shal haue merci £on whom I shal haue mercy, £and I shal ȝife merci £on whom I shal haue merci.
Þerfore it is not neþer £of man willinge, £neþir rennyng, £but of God hauynge merci.
And þe scripture seiþ to Farao, £For to þis þing I haue stired þee, £þat I shewe in þee my vertu, £and þat my name be toold in al erþe.
Þerfore of whom God wole, £he haþ merci, £and whom he wole, £he endureþ. £Þanne seist þou to me, £What is souȝt ȝit? £For who wiþstondeþ his wille? £O man, £whoo art þou, £þat answerist to God? £Wher a maad þing seiþ to him £þat made it, £What hast þou maad me so? £Wheþer a potter of clei £haþ not power to make £of þe same gobett £oo vessel in to onour, £anoþer in to dispijt? £Þat if God willinge £to shewe his wraþþe, £and to make his power knowen, £haþ suffrid in gret pacience £vessels of wraþþe able in to deþ, £to shewe þe riȝcchessis £of his glorie £in to vessels of merci, £wiche he made redie in to glorie.
Wiche also he clepide not oneli of Jewis, £but also of heþene men, £25 as he seiþ in Osee, £I shal clepe not my puple my puple, £and not my louede my louede, £and not getinge merci geting merci; £and it shal be in þe place, £where it is seid to hem, £Not ȝe my puple, £þere þei shulen be clepid £þe sones of God lifinge. £But Isaie crieþ for Israel, £If þe noumbre of Israel £shal be as þe grauele of þe see, £þe relifes shulen be made safe.
Forsoþe a word makinge an ende, £and abreȝgginge in equyte, £for þe Lord shal £make a word breȝggid £on al erþe.
And as Isaie bifore seide, £But God of oostis hadde laft £to vs seed, £we hadden be maad as Sodom, £and we hadden be lijk as Gomor.
Þerfore what shulen we seie? £Þat heþene men £þat sueden not riȝtwesnesse, £han geten riȝtwesnesse, ȝhe, £þe riȝtwesnesse þat is of feiþ.
But Israel suynge £þe lawe of riȝtwesnesse, £cam not parfittli £in to þe lawe of riȝtwesnesse. £Whi? For not of feiþ, £but as of werkis.
And þei spurneden £aȝens þe stoon of offencion, £as it is writen, Lo! £I putte a stoon of offencion in Sion, £and a stoon of sclaundre; £and ech þat shal bileue in it, £shal not be confoundid.
CAP. X. £Breþern, þe wille of my herte £and my biseching £is maad to God £for hem in to helþe.
But I bere wittnessing to hem, £þat þei han loue of God, £but not aftir kunnyng.
For þei vnknowing Goddis riȝtwesnesse, £and sekinge to make stidefast her owne riȝtfulnesse, £ben not sogett to þe riȝtwesnesse of God.
For þe eende £of þe lawe is Crist, £to riȝtwesnesse to eche man þat bileueþ.
For Moises wroot, £For þe man þat shal do riȝtwesnesse £þat is of þe lawe, £shal life in it.
But þe riȝtwesnesse þat is of bileue, £seiþ þus, £Seie þou not in þi herte, £Who shal stie in to heuene? £(þat is to seie, £to leede doun Crist), £7 or who shal go doun in to helle? £(þat is, £to aȝenclepe Crist £fro deeþ).
But what seiþ þe scripture? £Þe word is niȝ in þi mouþ, £and in þi herte; £þis is þe word of bileue, £wiche we prechen.
Þat if þou knowlechist £in þi mouþ þe Lord Jhesu Crist, £and bileuest in þi herte, £þat God reiside him £fro deeþ, £þou shalt be saaf.
For bi herte me bileueþ to riȝtwesnesse, £but bi mouþ knowleching £is maad to heelþe.
For whi þe scripture seiþ, £Eche þat bileueþ to in him, £shal not be confoundid.
And þer is no distinccion of Jew and of Greke; £for þe same Lord £of alle is riche in alle, £þat inwardli clepen him.
For eche man £who euere shal inwardli £clepe þe name of þe Lord, £shal be saaf.
How þanne shulen þei inwardli clepe him, £in to whom þei han not bileued? £Or hou shulen þei bileue to him, £whom þei han not herd? £Hou shulen þei here, £wiþ oute a prechour? £And hou shulen þei preche, £but þei be sent? £As it is writen, £Hou feire ben þe feet £of hem þat prechen pees, £of hem þat prechen goode þingis.
But not alle men obeien to þe gospel.
For Isaie seiþ, £Lord, who bileuede £to oure heering? £Þerfore feiþ is of heering, £but heering bi þe word of Crist.
Here begynnyth a schort tretys £and a comfortabyl for synful wrecchys, £wherin thei may have gret solas and comfort £to hem and undyrstondyn the hy £and unspecabyl mercy £of ower sovereyn Savyowr Cryst Jhesu, £whos name be worschepd and magnyfyed £wythowten ende, £that now in ower days £to us unworthy deyneth £to exercysen hys nobeley £and hys goodnesse.
Alle the werkys of ower Saviowr £ben for ower exampyl and instruccyon, £and what grace that he werkyth £in any creatur £is ower profyth £yf lak of charyté £be not ower hynderawnce.
And therfor, £be the leve of ower mercyful Lord Cryst Jhesu, £to the magnyfying of hys holy name, £Jhesu, this lytyl tretys £schal tretyn sumdeel £in parcel of hys wonderful werkys, £how mercyfully, how benyngly, £and how charytefully he meved and stered £a synful caytyf unto hys love, £whech synful caytyf many yerys was in wyl £and in purpose thorw steryng £of the Holy Gost £to folwyn oure Savyour, £makyng gret behestys of fastyngys £wyth many other dedys of penawns.
And evyr sche was turned agen abak £in tym of temptacyon, £lech unto the reedspyr whech boweth £wyth every wynd £and nevyr is stable £les than no wynd bloweth, £unto the tyme £that ower mercyfulle Lord Cryst £Jhesu havyng pety and compassyon £of hys handwerke and hys creatur £turnyd helth into sekenesse, £prosperyté into adversyté, £worshep into repref, £and love into hatered.
Thus alle this thyngys turnyng up so down, £this creatur whych many yerys £had gon wyl £and evyr ben unstable £was parfythly drawen and steryd £to entren the wey of hy perfeccyon, £whech parfyth wey Cryst £ower Savyowr £in hys propyr persoone examplyd.
Sadly he trad it £and dewly he went it beforn.
Than this creatur, £of whom thys tretys £thorw the mercy £of Jhesu schal schewen in party the levyng, £towched be the hand of owyr Lord £wyth grett bodyly sekenesse, £wher thorw sche lost reson £and her wyttes a long tym £tyl ower Lord £be grace restoryd her ageyn, £as it schal mor £openly be schewed aftyrward.
Her werdly goodys, £whech wer plentyuows and abundawnt £at that day, £in lytyl whyle after £wer ful bareyn and bare.
Than was pompe and pryde cast down £and leyd on syde.
Thei that beforn had worshepd £her sythen ful scharply reprevyd her; £her kynred and thei that had ben frendys £wer now hyr most enmys.
Than sche, £consyderyng this wondyrful chawngyng, £sekyng socowr undyr £the wengys of hyr gostly modyr, £Holy Cherch, £went and obeyd hyr £to hyr gostly fadyr, £accusyng hyrself of her mysdeds, £and sythen ded gret bodyly penawns.
And in schort tyme ower mercyful Lord £vysytyd this creatur £wyth plentyuows teerys of contricyon day be day, £in so mech that sum men seyden sche mygth wepen £whan sche wold £and slawndered the werk of God.
Sche was so usyd £to be slawndred and repreved, £to be cheden £and rebuked of the world £for grace and vertu £wyth whech sche was indued £thorw the strength of the Holy Gost £that it was to her £in a maner of solas and comfort £whan sche sufferyd £any dysese for the lofe of God £and for the grace that God wrowht in hyr.
For evyr the mor slawnder £and repref that sche sufferyd, £the mor sche incresyd in grace £and in devocyon £of holy medytacyon £of hy contemplacyon £and of wonderful spechys £and dalyawns £whech owr Lord spak and dalyid £to hyr sowle, £techyng hyr how sche schuld be despysed £for hys lofe, £how sche schuld han pacyens, £settyng all hyr trost, £alle hyr lofe, £and alle hyr affeccyon £in hym only.
Sche knew and undyrstod £many secret and prevy thyngys £whech schuld beffallen £aftyrward be inspiracyon £of the Holy Gost.
And often tymes, £whel sche was kept £wyth swech holy spechys and dalyawns, £sche schuld so wepyn and sobbyn £that many men £wer gretly awondyr, £for thei wysten ful lytyl £how homly ower Lord was in hyr sowle.
Ne hyrself cowd nevyr £telle the grace £that sche felt, £it was so hevenly, £so hy aboven hyr reson £and hyr bodyly wyttys, £and hyr body so febyl £in tym of the presens of grace £that sche myth nevyr expressyn it £wyth her word lych £as sche felt it in hyr sowle. £Than had this creatur mech drede £for illusyons and deceytys £of hyr gostly enmys.
Than went sche be the byddyng of the Holy Gost £to many worshepful clerkys, £bothe archebysshopys and bysshoppys, £doctowrs of dyvynyté and bachelers also.
Sche spak also wyth many ankrys £and schewed hem hyr maner of levyng and swech grace £as the Holy Gost of hys goodnesse £wrowt in hyr mende £and in hyr sowle £as her wytt wold serven hyr £to expressyn it.
And thei alle that sche schewed hyr secretys £unto seyd sche was mech bownde £to loven ower Lord £for the grace £that he schewyd unto hyr £and cownseld hyr £to folwyn hyr mevynggys £and hyr steringgys £and trustly belevyn it £weren of the Holy Gost £and of noon evyl spyryt.
Summe of these worthy and worshepful clerkys £tokyn it in perel of her sowle £and as thei wold answer to God £that this creatur was inspyred £wyth the Holy Gost £and bodyn hyr £that sche schuld don hem wryten £and makyn a booke £of hyr felyngys and hir revelacyons.
Sum proferyd hir to wrytyn hyr felyngys £wyth her owen handys, £and sche wold not consentyn £in no wey, £for sche was comawndyd £in hir sowle £that sche schuld not wrytyn so soone.
And so it was twenty yer and mor £fro that tym this creatur £had fyrst felyngys and revelacyons £er than sche dede any wryten.
Aftyrward whan it plesyd ower Lord, £he comawnded hyr £and chargyd £hir that sche schuld don wryten £hyr felyngys and revelacyons £and the forme of her levyngs £that hys goodnesse myth be knowyn £to alle the world.
Than had the creatur no wryter £that wold fulfyllyn hyr desyr £ne geve credens £to hir felingys £unto the tym £that a man dwellyng in Dewchlond £whech was an Englyschman £in hys byrth £and sythen weddyd in Dewchland £and had ther bothe a wyf and a chyld, £havyng good knowlach £of this creatur £and of hir desyr, £meved I trost thorw the Holy Gost, £cam into Yngland £wyth hys wyfe £and hys goodys and dwellyd £wyth the forseyd creatur £tyl he had wretyn £as mech as sche wold tellyn hym £for the tym £that thei wer togydder. £And sythen he deyd.
Than was ther £a prest whech this creatur £had gret affeccyon to, £and so sche comownd £wyth hym of this mater £and browt hym the boke to redyn. £The booke was so evel wretyn £that he cowd lytyl skyll theron, £for it was neithyr good Englysch ne Dewch, £ne the lettyr was not schapyn ne formyd £as other letters ben.
Therfor the prest leved £fully ther schuld nevyr man redyn it, £but it wer special grace.
Nevyrthelesse, £he behyte hir £that if he cowd redyn it £he wolde copyn it owt £and wrytyn it betyr £wyth good wylle.
Than was ther £so evel spekyng of this creatur £and of hir wepyng £that the prest durst not for cowardyse speke £wyth her but seldom, £ne not wold wryten £as he had behestyd £unto the forseyd creatur.
And so he voyded and deferryd the wrytyng £of this boke £wel onto a fourth yer or ellys mor, £notwythstandyng the creatur cryed £often on hym therfor.
At the last he seyd onto hir £that he cowd not redyn it, £wherfor he wold not do it.
He wold not, £he seyd, £put hym in perel therof.
Than he cownseld hir £to gon to a good man £whech had ben mech conversawnt £wyth hym £that wrot fyrst the booke, £supposyng that he schuld £cun best rede the booke, £for he had sum tym red letters £of the other mannys £wrytyng sent fro beyonden the see £whyl he was in Dewchland.
And so sche went to that man, £preyng hym to wrytyn this booke £and nevyr to bewreyn it £as long as sche leved, £grawntyng hym a grett summe £of good for hys labowr.
And this good man £wrot abowt a leef, £and yet it was lytyl to the purpose, £for he cowd not wel fare therwyth £the boke was so evel sett £and so unresonably wretyn.
Than the prest was vexyd £in his consciens, £for he had behestyd hyr £to wrytyn this boke, £yyf he mygth com £to the redyng therof, £and dede not hys part £as wel as he mygth a do, £and preyd this creatur £to getyn ageyn the booke £yf sche myth goodly.
Than sche gat ageyn the book £and browt it £to the preste £wyth rygth glad cher, £preyng hym to do hys good wyl, £and sche schuld prey to God £for hym and purchasyn hym grace £to reden it £and wrytyn it also.
The preste, £trustyng in hire prayers, £began to redyn this booke, £and it was mych mor esy, £as hym thowt, £than it was beforntym.
And so he red it ovyr £beforn this creatur every word, £sche sumtym helpyng £where ony difficulté was.
Thys boke is not wretyn in ordyr, £every thyng aftyr other £as it wer don, £but lych as the mater cam £to the creatur in mend £whan it schuld be wretyn, £for it was so long £er it was wretyn £that sche had forgetyn the tyme £and the ordyr £whan thyngys befellyn.
And therfor sche dede no thing wryten £but that sche knew rygth wel £for very trewth.
Whan the prest began fyrst to wryten £on this booke, £hys eyn myssyd £so that he mygth not se to make hys lettyr £ne mygth not se to mend hys penne. £Alle other thyng he mygth se wel anow.
He sett a peyr of spectacles on hys nose, £and than wast wel wers £than it was befor. £He compleyned to the creatur £of hys dysese.
Sche seyd hys enmy had envye £at hys good dede £and wold lett hym £yf he mygth and bad hym do £as wel as God wold geve hym grace £and not levyn.
Whan he cam ageyn to hys booke, £he myth se as wel, £hym thowt, £as evyr he dede befor £be day lyth £and be candel lygth bothe.
And for this cause, £whan he had wretyn a qwayr, £he addyd a leef therto, £and than wrot he this proym £to expressyn mor openly £than doth the next folwyng, £whech was wretyn er than this.
Anno domini 1436.
Whan he was come £before hem they seide, £"Merlyn, £we knowe well thow art wise £and haste alwey loved wele £the kynges of this reame.
And thow knowest wele £that this londe £is lefte withouten heir, £and a londe withoute a lorde £availeth litill.
Therfore we pray thee and requere £to helpe us £to chese soche a man £as myght the reame governe £to the profite of the peple £and savacion of Holy Cherche."
And Merlin seide, £"I am no soche man £that owe to entermete £of soche counseile, £ne that I sholde chese a man £to be a governoure.
But yef ye acorde to myn awarde £I shall telle yow; £and yef I sey not wele, £acordeth not therto."
And thei seide, £"Alle to the welfare £and profite of us £alle oure Lorde sende grace!" £And Merlin seide, £"I have moche loved this reame £and the peple therinne, £and yef I wolde telle yow £whom ye sholde make youre kynge, £I ought wele to be beleved, £and it were right.
Bot oon faire aventure is yow befallen, £yef ye will it knowen.
The kynge is now deed sithe Martinmasse, £and fro hens to Yoole £is but litill space.
And yef ye leve my counseile, £I shall yeve yow gode and trewe, £bothe ageyn God and the worlde."
And thei seiden alle at ones, £"Sey what thow wilte, £and we shall it holden."
And he seide, £"Ye knowe wele £that now cometh the feste £that oure Lorde was inne ibore, £and He is Lorde £of alle lordes.
And I will undirtake, £yef ye and alle the peple £comynyally pray to oure Lorde £for His grete pité £for to sende yow a rightfull governour, £as He thourgh His grete humylité £at this feste cleped Yooleliste £to be born of a virgyn, £and Kynge of alle kynges, £that He at this feste chese yow soche a man £to be youre kynge and lorde, £that the peple may rule and governe £to His plesir; £and that He shew soche demonstraunce £that the peple may se and knowe £that it is be His eleccion, £and that he that so £is chosen be kynge £withoute eny other eleccion.
And wite ye well, £yef ye thus do, £ye shull se the eleccion £of oure Lorde Jhesu Criste."
Than they ansuerde alle £with oon assent and seide, £"We acorde with this counseile, £and ther is noon erthly man £but that he ought therto acorde."
Than thei praide £alle bisshopis and archebisshopes £to comaunde thourgh £all the cherches £that the peple to praye £as ye have herde.
And alle the lordes were sworne oon £to another to holde the awarde of Holy Cherche, £in that God wolde hem shewen.
In this maner be thei acorded £to the counseile of Merlin.
And Merlyn toke leve of hem, £and thei hym praide £to be with hem at Cristemasse, £to se yef it were soth or no £that he hadde hem taught.
And Merlyn seide, £"I shall not be ther, £for ye shull not se me £till the elecccion be made."
Thus wente Merlin to Blase £and tolde hym alle these thinges.
Than alle the worthy men £of the reame of Logres, £thei come unto Logres at the Yole.
Thus was this thinge don £and abiden to the Yole.
And Antor, that hadde this childe norisshed £till he was a moche man £of fifteen yere of age, £he hadde hym trewly norisshed £so that he was faire and moche; £and he hadde never soken other mylke £but of his wif, £and his sone he hadde made £to be norysshed of another woman.
Ne Antor wiste not £whether he loved better, £ne he cleped hym £never but his sone; £and he wende verily £that he hadde ben his fader.
At Halowmasse Antor made hys sone knyght, £and at Yoole he come to Logres, £as did the other knyghtes of the londe, £and brought with hym his two sones.
On Yoole Even was assembled £alle the clergie of the reame, £and alle the barouns £that weren of valoure £and wele hadde don £as Merlin hadde seide.
And whan they were alle come, £thei ledde alle symple lif and honeste.
Thus thei abode all the Yoole Even £and weren at messe at mydnyght, £and made mekely theire orisouns £to oure Lorde, £that He of His grace £sende hem soche a man £that myght profitably meyntene hem £and the Cristen feith.
Thus they abode the messe of the day, £and so ther were many £that seide thei were foles £that trowed oure Lorde £wolde put his entente £to chesinge of her kynge.
And as thei were in this talkynge, £thei rounge to messe of the day, £and so thei yede to servise.
Whan thei were alle assembled, £ther was oon of the holiest men £of the londe araied £to singe the messe.
But er he yede to messe, £he spake to the peple and seide, £"Ye be assembled £for thre thinges £for youre profite, £and I shall say yow £whiche thei be: £first of all, £for the savacion £of youre soules; £and for the wurship of God; £and the myracle and high vertu £that He thys day shall shewe amonge us, £yef it be His plesir £to yeve us a kynge and chiefteyn £that may save and mayntene Holy Cherche, £that is the sustenaunce £of alle trewe Cristen peple.
We be come to chese oon of us; £we be not so wise to knowe £who is moste profitable £of alle this peple.
And for that we ne knowe, £we owe to praye £to the Kynge of kynges £that is Jhesu Criste oure Saveoure, £that He shewe us verry tokenynge £to His pleasaunce, £as He was bore on this day.
So every man praye £in the beste wise he can."
And thus they did £as the gode man hem counseiled.
And he yede forth to masse, £and he com to the gospell £and that thei hadden offred.
Some of the peple yede £oute of the cherche £where ther was a voyde place.
And whan they com oute of the cherche, £thei sawgh it gan dawe and clere, £and saugh before the cherche dore £a grete ston foure square, £and ne knewe of what ston it was -- £but some seide it was marble.
And above, in the myddill place £of this ston, £ther stode a styth of iren £that was largely half a fote of height.
And thourgh this stithi £was a swerde ficchid into the ston.
When thei sye this £that firste weren come £oute of the chirche, £thei hadde gret merveile £and yede agein £into the chirche £and tolde the archebisshop.
And whan the gode man £that sange masse herde this, £he toke haly water £and caste upon the stith.
And the archebisshop lowted £to the swerde £and sawgh letteres of golde £in the stiel.
And he redde the letteres that seiden, £"Who taketh this swerde £out of this ston £sholde be kynge £by the eleccion of Jhesu Criste."
And when he hadde redde this letteres, £he seide to the peple £what it ment.
Than was the ston delivered £to ten worthi men to kepe, £and to two clerkes.
Than thei seiden £that oure Lorde £hadde hem shewed feire myracle, £and yeden agein £into the mynistre £to heir oute the masse £and to yelde oure Lorde graces.
And thei songen £"Te Deum Laudamus."
And whan the gode man £was come to the awter, £he turned to the peple and seide, £"Feire lordes, £now may ye se £that some of yow be goode men, £when thourgh youre prayers £and orisouns oure Lorde £hath shewde this grete myracle.
Wherfore I praye and reqire yow £above alle vertues £in this erthe, £for highnesse ne erthly richesse £that God hath yoven £in this worlde, £that noon be agein this eleccion £that God hath us shewde the demonstraunce.
And the surpluys £He shall us shewen £at His volunté."
Thanne the gode man £sange forth the masse.
And whan it was fynisshed £they assembled £aboute the ston, £bothe oon and other £who that myght take £oute this swerde firste.
And than thei seiden and acorded £alle that thei sholde assaien it £as the mynistres of Holy Cherche wolde assigne.
To this ther was grete discorde £amonge the higheste men £and moste puyssaunt.
And thei that hadde force seide £they wolden asseyen firste.
So ther were many wordes £that ought not to be rehersed.
The archebisshop spake £that alle myght heren and seide, £"Sirs, £ye ne be not so wise £ne so wele avised men £as I wende.
And I will wele £that ye alle wite £that oure Lorde hath oon ichosen, £but I knowe not whom.
And thus moche may I say to yow, £that gentilnesse ne richesse £shall have no power agein £the wille of Jhesu Criste, £but truste so moche in Hym £that yef he that is £therto chosen were yet unbore, £it shall never be taken £oute of the ston £till he come £that it is ordeyned the honour." £Than acorded alle the noble men and wise, £and seide that he hadde seide soth.
And the wise men £and the high barouns £toke their counseile £and acorded to stonde £the ordenaunce of the archebisshop, £and [thei] com agein £and seiden heringe £alle the peple.
And than made the bisshop grete joye £and dide wepe £for pité and seide, £"This humylité that is £in youre hertes £is of God.
And I will that ye knoweafter myn entente £shall be to the volunté of God £and profite of Cristen feith, £so that I shall have no blame £yef God will." £This parlament was before high messe £of the assay of the swerde, £till that high messe was saide.
Than seide the archebisshop £to the peple £and shewde hem the gret myracle £that God hadde don for hem £at this eleccion: £"And whan oure Lorde sette justice in erthe, £He sette it in the styth £and in the swerde.
And the justice over the lay peple £ought to be the swerde, £for the swerde £at the begynynge was take £to thre orderes £to diffende Holy Cherche £and mayntene rightwisnesse.
And oure Lorde hath now made eleccion £be the swerde.
And wite it wele, £alle that this have seen and beholde, £to whom He will the justice yeve.
And lete no man be to hasty £for to assaye, £for it shall never be drawen oute £for richesse ne for pride.
Ne the poure peple be not displesed £though the lordes £and the high astates assaye before, £for it is right and reson £that the lordes assaien firste.
For ther ne is noon of yow £but he ought to have his kynge £and his lorde the beste and moste worthy man £that he kowthe knowe be his reson."
Thus thei acorded to the archebisshop £with gode herte £and withouten evyll will, £that he sholde chese hem £that he wolde to assaye firste.
Thus thei graunted alle £to holde hym £for hir kynge £to whom God wolde shewe his grace.
Thanne the archebisshop chese £oute one hundred fifty £of the hiest and moste worthi lordes £and made hem go to the assaie.
And whan they hadde alle assayed, £than he commaunded alle other to assaye.
And than they assayden alle they, £oon after another, that assaye wolde. £But ther was noon £that myght it taken oute.
And so it was comaunded £to be kept with ten noble men, £and thei were charged £to take goode hede £who com to assaien, £and yef eny ther were £that myght drawen out of the ston. £Thus was the swerde assaied £alle the eight dayes, £and alle the barouns were at high messe.
And the archebisshop hem preched and shewde £as hym semed beste.
And than he seide, £"I tolde yow wele £that all be leysere myght he come £that was ferthest £fro the assaye of this swerde.
Now may ye verily knowe £that never noon, £saf he that oure Lorde will, £ne shall it not oute take."
And than thei seiden £alle that thei wolde not out of the town £till thei westen £to whom God wolde graunte that honoure.
In that maner thei abiden oute the messe, £and after thei wente £to their hosteles to mete.
And after mete, £as they were used that tyme, £yede the barouns and the knyghtes £to boorde in a feire pleyn, £and the ten men that were ordeyned £to kepe this swerde £yede also to se this bourdise.
And when the knyghtes hadde turneyd awhile, £thei toke their sheldes £to their squeres £so that the peple of the town yede £to arme them. £And Antor hadde made his eldeste sone knyght £at the Halowtide £before Yoole.
And whan the medlé was begunne, £Kay called his brother Arthur and seide, £"Go faste to oure oste £and fecche my swerde."
And Arthur was goode and servisable and seide, £"With gode will."
And than [he] smote the hors £with the spores £and rode forth £to his ostell £for to fecche his brothers swerde, £or ellis some other, £yef he myght eny fynde.
And he fonde noon, £for the hostesse hadde sette it £in hir chambir.
And so he turned to hem agein.
And whan he saugh he myght noon fynde, £he gan to wepe for grete anger.
And as he come before the mynster £ther the ston was, £he saugh the swerde £whiche he hadde never assaide, £and thought, £yef he myght it gete, £to bere it to his brother.
And as he com therby on horse bakke, £he hente the swerde £be the hiltes £and drough it oute, £and covered it with his lappe.
And his brother that abode after £withoute the towne saugh hym come, £and rode agein hym £and asked his swerde.
And Arthur seide he myght not have it, £"but I have brought heere another," £and drough it £oute from undyr his cote £and toke it £to his brother.
And anoon as Kay saugh this swerde, £he knewe it wele £that it was the swerde £of the ston £and thought he wolde be kynge, £and seide he wolde seche his fader £till he fonde hym; £and than he seide, £"Sire, I shall be kynge.
Lo, here is the swerde of the ston."
Whan the fader it saugh, £he hadde merveile £how he it gatt. £And he seide he toke it £oute of the ston. £Whan Antor herde £that he leved it not £but seide he dide lye. £Than thei yede £to the mynster £ther the ston was, £and the tother squyre after.
Whan Antor sigh the ston £and the swerde £not therynne he seide, £"Feire sone, £how hadde ye this swerde? £Loke ye do not lye; £and thow do lye, £I shall it knowewele £and never shall I thee love."
And he ansuerde as he £that was sore ashamed, £"I shall yow lye no lesynge, £for my brother Arthur it me brought £whan I badde hym £to go fecche myn. £But I wote never how he it hadde." £Whan Antor herde this he seide, £"Sone, £yeve it me, £for ye have therto no ryght." £And Kay it delivered £to his fader. £And he loked behynde hym £and saugh Arthur £and cleped hym and seide, £"Come hider, £faire sone, £and take this swerde £and put it theras £ye it toke."
And he toke the swerde £and put it in the stith, £and it heilde as wele or better £than it dide before.
And Antor comaunded his sone Kay £to take it oute.
And he assaied, £but it wolde not be.
Than Antor cleped hem bothe £and seide to Kay, £"I wiste well £that thow haddest not take the swerde oute."
Thanne he toke Arthur £in his armes and seide, £"Feire dere sone, £yef I myght purchase £that ye be kynge, £what gode sholde I have therfore?" £"Fader," £quod he, £"I may nother have that honour £ne noon other goode £but that ye be therof lorde, £as my lorde and my fader."
And he seide, £"Sir, £youre fader I am as in norture, £but certes, £I dide yow never engender, £ne I wot never £who dide yow engender."
Whan Arthur saugh £that Antor hym denyed £to ben hys fader, £he wepte tendirly £and hadde grete doel and seide, £"Feire sir, £how sholde I have this dignité £or eny other £whan I have failed to have a fader?" £"A fader muste ye nede have.
But feire dere sir, £yef oure Lorde will £that ye have this grace £and I helpe yow it to purchase, £telle me what I shall be the better."
And Arthur seide, £"Sir, £so as ye will youreself."
Thanne Antor tolde hym £what bounté he hadde hym don, £and how he hadde hym norisshed, £and how he put awey his sone Kay £and made hym £to be norisshed £of a straunge woman.
"Wherefore ye owe £to yeve my sone £and me guerdon, £for ther was never man £more tenderly norisshed £than I have yow.
Wherefore I praye yow, £yef God yeve yow this grace £and I may helpe yow therto, £that ye guerdon me and my sone."
And Arthur seide, £"I pray yow £that ye denye not me £to be my fader, £for than I sholde not wite £whether that I sholde go.
And yef ye may £helpeto purchase this grace, £and God will that I have it, £ye can nothinge sey ne comaunde £but I shall it do."
And Antor seide, £"I shall not aske thi londe; £but thus moche I will praye yow, £that yef ye be kynge, £that ye make my sone £Kay youre stywarde in soche maner £that for no forfet £that he do to yow, £ne to man of youre londe, £that he lese not hys office.
And yef he be fool or fell or vilenis, £ye owe better to suffre hym £than eny other.
And therfore I praye yow £to graunte hym £that I yow demaunde."
And Arthur seide £he wolde it do £with gode will.
And than he ledde hym £to the auter £and swore that he sholde this trewly performe.
And whan he hadde sworne, £he com before the mynster; £and the turnement was ended, £and the barouns com to hire evesonge.
Than Antor cleped £alle his frendes £and com to the archebisshop and seide, £"Sir, lo, £here is a childe of myn £that is no knyght, £that prayeth me £that I wolde helpe £that he myght assay the aventure £of the swerde, £and that it plese yow £to clepe the barouns."
And so he did, £and thei assembled £aboute the ston.
Than Antor bad Arthur take £oute the swerde £and delyvere it to the archebisshop.
And Arthur toke the swerde £be the hiltes £and withoute more taryinge yaf it £to the archebisshop.
And anoon he toke Arthur £in his armes and seide, £"Te Deum Laudamus," £and so brought hym £into the mynster.
And the barouns and high men £that this hadde seyn and herde £were angry and sorowfull for this, £and seiden it myght not be £that soche a symple man £of so lowe degré £sholde be lorde of hem alle.
Therwith was the archebisshop displesed £and seide, £"Sirs, £oure Lorde knoweth £beste what every man is."
And Antor and his frendes abode by Arthur, £and alle the comen peple.
And alle the barouns £were ageyn them and ageyn Arthur.
And thanne seide the archebisshop £wordes of grete hardynesse: £"I do yow to wite thaugh £alle thei that ben in the £worlde wolde be agein this eleccion, £and oure Lorde will £that this man be kynge, £he shall be it £withouten faile.
And I shall shewe yow £how and what affiaunce I have £in oure Lorde Jhesu Criste.
Now, feire brother Arthur, £go put the swerde ageyn £in the same place £that ye toke itfro."
And Arthur put the swerde ageyn £in the selve place, £and it hilde £as faste as byfore.
And than seide the archebisshop, £"So feire eleccion was never sene.
Now go ye riche barouns and lordes £and assay yef ye may take £oute the swerde."
Than yede alle for to assaye, £but noon it myght remeve £fro the place that it was inne.
Than seide the archebisshop, £"Grete folye do ye £that be ageyn oure Lordes wille -- £for now ye se well how it is."
And thei seide, £"Sir, £we ne be not agein oure Lordes wille, £but it ys grevouse thinge to us £to have a garcion £to be lorde over us alle."
And the archebisshop seide, £"He that hath hym chosyn knoweth beste £what he is."
Thanne the barouns praide the bisshop £to lete the swerde be stille £in the ston tille Candelmesse; £and by that tyme, £men of ferther contrees myght come £to assaye the aventure.
And the archebisshop hem graunted.
Than come oute £of every contree and asseyde, £who that wolde.
And whan they hadden assaied, £the archebisshop seide, £"Arthur, £yef it be pleser £to oure Lorde Jhesu Criste £that thow be kynge, £go forth and brynge that swerde."
And Arthur yede to the swerde £and toke it oute £as lyghtly as nothinge hadde it holden.
Whan the prelates £and the comen peple saugh this, £thei gunne to wepe £for joye and pité and seiden, £"Sirs, £is ther yet eny man £that seith agein this eleccion?" £And the barouns seide, £"Syr, £we pray yow £that the swerde be suffred £yet in the ston to Passh, £but eny man come £by that terme £that may take it thens; £and ellis we will obbey to this.
And yef ye will not suffre £so longe tyme, £every man do the beste he may."
And the archebisshop seide, £"Yef so be he abide to Passh, £and noon other come £that may parforme this aventure, £wele ye than obbey yow to this eleccion?" £And thei seide alle, £"Ye."
Thanne the archebisshop seide to Arthur, £"Sette the swerde agein £in the ston, £for yef God will, £thow shalt not faile £of the dignité £that he hath thee promysed." £And Arthur did £as he comaunded.
And ther was ordeyned £to kepe the ston ten men and five clerkes; £and in this maner £thei bode to Pasch.
And the archebisshop that hadde take Arthur £in warde seide, £"Wite ye right well £ye shall be kynge £and lorde of this peple.
Now loke that ye be a gode man, £and fro hensforth cheseth soche men £as shull be of youre counseile £and officers £for youre housolde, £even as ye were now kynge, £for so ye shall be £with the helpe of God."
And Arthur seide, £"I put me holly in God £and in Holy Cherche £and in youre gode counseile.
Therfore chese ye £as ye seme be moste £to the plesaunce of Jhesu Criste.
And I praye yow clepe £to yow my lorde my fader."
Than the archebisshop cleped Antor £and shewde hym £the ansuere of Arthur.
Thanne chose they soche counsellers £as thei wolde; £and be counseile of the archebisshop £and certein of the barouns, £Kay was made stiwarde.
And of alle othir thinges £thei abode to Pasch, £and than thei assembled at Logres.
Whan thei were alle assembled £on the Ester Even, £the archebisshop drough hem £alle to his paleis £and rehersed £hem the grete wisdom £and the gode condiciouns £that he fonde in Arthur.
And the barouns seide, £"We will not be agein Godes ordenaunce; £but it is unto us a mervelouse thynge £that so yonge a man, £and of so base lyngnage, £sholde be lorde and governour £of us alle."
The archebisshop seide, £"Ye do not as Cristen men £thus to be agein Cristes eleccion."
And they seide, £"We be not ther agein; £but ye have seyn his condiciouns, £and we ne have not don so.
And therfore we praye yow £to suffre us £to knowe his condiciouns £and the manere of hys governaunce £that he will ben of hereafter."
The archebisshop seide, £"Will ye thus delaye his coronacioun?" £And they seide, £"We wolde that his sacringe and coronacion £be respite to Penticoste. £Thus we alle pray and requere." £And the archebisshop it graunted. £Thus departed alle the counseile.
And on the morowe £whan high messe was seide, £Arthur yede to the swerde £and toke it oute £as lightly as he hadde don before.
Than thei seiden £alle that thei wolde have hym £to their lorde and governoure, £and thei praide hym £to sette ther the swerde agein.
And Arthur ansuerde £to the barouns full debonerly £and seide he wolde do their requeste, £or eny thinge £that thei wolde of hym desire.
Thanne they ledde hym £into the mynster to speke with hym £and to assaye his condiciouns and seide, £"Sir, £we se well that God will £that ye be oure kynge £and lorde over us, £wherfore we will do £to yow oure homage £and of yow holde oure honoures.
And we beseke yow £to respite youre sacringe £into Pentecoste, £ne therfore shull ye £nothynge be inteript £but that ye shull be oure lorde £and oure kynge.
But to this we praye yow £to seye us what is your volunté."
Quod Arthur, £"Of that ye sey ye will do £to me youre homages £and holde youre honoures of me, £I may it not receyve, £ne I ne ought not to do so, £for I may not to yow £ne to noon £other yeve noon honoures £till I have receyved myn.
And ther ye sey ye will £that I be lorde of yow £and of the reame, £that may not be byfore £that I be sacred and receyved £the honoure of the empere.
But the respite that ye desire £I it graunte yow £with gode will, £for I will not be sacred, £ne nothinge that therto aperteneth, £ne I may not withouten Godes will £and youre volunté."
Thanne seide the barouns amonge hemselfe, £"Yef this childe live, £he shall be right wise; £and wele he hath us ansuerde."
And than thei seide, £"Sir, £us semeth with youre advice £that ye be crowned and sacred £at Pentecoste, £and by that terme £we shull obbey to yow £at the comaundement £of this archebisshop."
Thanne thei made be brought juellis £and alle othir richesse and yaf it to hym £to se whedir £he wolde be covetouse and cacchynge.
And whan he hadde £alle these yeftes resceyved, £the booke seith he departed it: £to knyghtes, £the stedes and coursers and fresshe robes; £and to hem that were joly and envoisies, £he yaf the juwellis; £and to hem that were averouse, £golde and silver; £and to sadde wise men, £he yaf soche thinge £as hym thought sholde hem plese.
And with hem he heilde companye £and enquered in the contré £what myght hem beste plese.
Thus departed he the yeftes £that were yoven hym, £for to knowe of what condicion £that he wolde be of.
And whan thei sawgh hym £thus demened, £ther was noon £but that hym gretly preysed £in theire hertes, £and seide that he sholde £be of high renon, £and that thei cowde not in hym £espie no poynte of covetise.
But as sone as he hadde the grete avers, £he besette hem in soche manere £that every man seide £that noon cowde have do better, £everych astate and degré.
Thus thei assaide Arthur £and nought cowde fynde in hym £but high vertu and grete discrecion.
And so thei abiden to the Witsontide, £and than alle the baronage assembled at Logres.
And ther thei assaide agein £at the swerde £alle that assaie wolde, £but never was ther founde man £that it myght remeve fro the ston.
And the archebisshop hadde ordeyned £redy the crowne and septre £and all that longed £to the sacringe.
On Witson Even, £be comen counseile £of alle the barouns, £the archebisshop made Arthur knyght.
