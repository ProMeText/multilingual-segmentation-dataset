Tractatus de Conclusionibus Astrolabii.


 



LItell Lowys my sone, I haue perceiued well by certeyne euidences thine
abilite to lerne sciencez touchinge noumbres & proporciouns; & as wel
considere I thy bisi preyere in special to lerne the tretis of the
astrelabie. than, for as mechel as a philosofre seith, he wrappeth
him in his frend, þat condescendith to the rihtful preiers of his
frend therfor haue I geuen the a suffisaunt astralabie as for owre
orizonte, compowned after the latitude of Oxenford vpon which, by
mediacion of this litel tretis, I purpose to teche the a certein nombre
of conclusions apertenyng to the same instrument. I seye a certein of
couclusiouns, for thre causes. the furste cause is this: truste wel
þat alle the conclusiouns that han ben fownde, or elles possibli myhten
be fownde in so noble an instrument as an astralabie, ben vnknowe
perfitly to any mortal man in this regioun, as I suppose. another
cause is this ; þat sothly, in any tretis of the astrelabie þat I haue
seyn, there ben some conclusions þat wole nat in alle thinges performen
hir byhestes;


 

 & some of hem ben to harde to thy tendre age of .x. yer to conseyue. 
this tretis, diuided in 5 parties, wole I shewe the vnder ful lihte
rewles & naked wordes in englissh ; for latyn ne kanstow yit but smal,
my lite sone. but natheles, suffise to the thise trewe conclusiouns in
englissh, as wel as suffisith to thise noble clerkes grekes thise same
conclusiouns in grek, & to arabiens in arabik, & to Iewes in Ebrew,
& to the latyn folk in latyn whiche latyn folk han hem furst owt of
othre diuerse langages, & writen in hir owne tonge, þat is to sein, in
latyn. & god wot, þat in alle this langages, & in many mo, han
thise conclusiouns ben suffisantly lerned & tawht & yit by diuerse
rewles, ryht as diuerse pathes leden diuerse folk the rihte wey to
Roome. Now wol I prey mekly euery discret persone þat redith or herith
this litel tretis, to haue my rewde endytyng for excused, & my
superfluite of wordes, for two causes. the firste cause is, for that
curios enditing & hard sentence Is ful heuy atones for swich a child
to lerne. & the seconde cause is this, þat sothly me semeth betre to
writen vnto a child twies a good sentence, than he forget it ones. 
And lowis, ȝif so be þat I shewe the in my lihte Englissh as trewe
conclusiouns touching this matere, & nawht only as trewe but as many &
as subtil conclusiouns as ben shewed in latyn in ani commune
tretis of the astrelabie kon me the more thank ; and preye god saue
the kyng, þat is lord of this langage, & alle that him feyth bereth &
obeieth, euerech in his degree, the more and the lasse. but considere
wel, that I ne vsurpe nat to haue fownde this werk of my labour or of
myn engin. I nam but a lewd compilatour of the labour of olde
Astrologens, and haue hit translated in myn englissh only for thi
doctrine ; & with this swerd shal I slen envie.


 

 The firste partie of this tretis shal reherse the figures & the
membres of thin Astrolabie, bycause þat thow shalt han the grettre
knowyng of thin owne instrument.

 The second partie shal teche the werken the verrey practik of the
forseide conclusiouns, as ferforth & as narwe as may be shewyd in so
smal an instrument portatif aboute. For wel wot euery astrologien þat
smalest fraccions ne wol nat ben shewid in so smal an instrument, as in
subtil tables calkuled for a kawse.

 The .3. partie shal contienen diuerse tables of longitudes & latitudes
of sterres fixe for the Astrolabie, & tables of declinacions of the
, & tables of longitudes of Citeez & of townes ; & as wel for
the gouernance of a clokke as for to fynde the altitude Meridian &
many nother notable conclusioun, aftur the kalendres of the reuerent
clerks, frere I. Somer & frere N. Lenne.

 The .4. partie shal ben a theorik to declare the Moeuynge of the
celestial bodies with causes. the whiche 4 partie in special shal
shewen a table of the verray Moeuyng of the Mone from howre to howre,
euery day & in euery signe, after thin Almenak vpon wych
table ther folwith a canon, suffisant to teche as wel the maner of the
wyrkyng of þat same conclusioun as to knowe in owre orizonte with wych
degree of the zodiac that the Mone arisith in any latitude & the
arising of any planete aftur his latitude fro the Ecliptik lyne.

 The .5. partie shal ben an introductorie aftur the statutz of owre
doctours, in which thow maist lerne a gret part of the general rewles of
theorik in Astrologie. in which .5. partie shaltow fynde tables of
equacions of howses aftur þe latitude of Oxenford; & tables of
dignetes of planetes & other noteful thingez yif god wol vouche sauf
& his modur the mayde, mo than I behete, &c.


 


 Her bygynneth the descripcion of the Astrelabie.


 

 Thyn Astrelabie hath a ring to putten on the towmbe of thy ryht
hand in takyng the heyhte of thynges. & tak kep, for from hennes
forthward, I wol clepe tho heyhte of any thing þat is taken by thy
rewle, the altitude, withowte mo wordes.


 

 This ring rennyth in A Maner turet, fast to the Moder of thyn
Astrelabie, in so Rowm a space þat hit desturbith nat the instrument to
hangen aftur his rihte centre.




 

 The moder of thin Astrelabie is thikkeste plate, perced with a
large hole, þat resseyuyth in hir wombe the thynne plates compowned for
diuerse clymatz, & thi Riet shapen in manere of a net or of a webbe of a
loppe ; & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


 

 This Moder is deuyded on the bakhalf with a lyne, þat cometh
dessendinge fro the ryng down to the nethereste bordure. the whiche
lyne, fro þe forseide Ryng vnto the centre of the large hole amydde,
is cleped the sowth lyne, or elles the lyne Meridional. & the remenant
of this lyne downe to the bordure is cleped the north lyne, or elles the
lyne of Midnyht. & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


 




 

 Ouerthwart this forseide longe lyne, ther crosseth hym another lyne
of the same lengthe from est to west. Of the whiche lyne, from a lityl
croys + in the bordure vnto the centre of the large hole, is cleped the
Est lyne, or elles the lyne Orientale ; & the remenant of this lyne
fro the forseide + vnto the bordure, is cleped the west lyne, or the
lyne occidentale. now hastow her the 4 quarters of thin astrelabie,
deuyded after the 4 principals plages or quarters of the firmament. &
for the more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


 

 The est side of thin Astrelabie is cleped the riht side, & the west
side is cleped the left side. forget nat this, lite lowys. put
the ring of thin Astralabie vpon the thowmbe of thy ryht hand, and
thanne wole his right side be toward thy left side, & his left side wol
be toward thy right side ; tak this rewle general, as wel on the bak as
on the wombeside. vpon the ende of this est lyne, as I first seide,
is marked a litel +, wher as eueremo generaly is considered the entring
of the first degree in wich the sonne arisith. & for the more
declaracioun, lo here þe figure.




 

 Fro this litel + vp to the ende of the lyne Meridional, vndur the
ryng, shaltow fynden the bordure deuyded with 90 degres ; & by that
same proporcioun is euery quarter of thin Astrolabie deuyded. ouer the
wiche degrees ther ben nowmbres of augrym, þat deuyden thilke same
degres fro 5 to 5, as shewith by longe strykes bytwene. of wyche longe
strykes the space by twene contienith a Milewey. & euery degree of
the bordure contieneth 4 Minutes, that to seyn, minutes of an
howre. & for more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


 




 

 Vnder the compas of thilke degres ben writen the names of the 12
signes, as Aries, taurus, gemini, Cancer, leo, virgo, libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces & the nombres of the degres
of tho signes ben writen in Augrim aboue, & with longe deuysiouns, fro 5
to 5 ; deuyded fro tyme þat the signe entreth vnto the laste ende. 
but vndorstond wel, þat thise degrees of signes ben euerich of hem
considered of 60 Mynutes, & euery Minute of 60 secondes, & so forth in
to smale fraccions infinit, as seith Alkabucius. & therfor, know wel,
þat a degree of the bordure contienith 4 Minutis, and a degre of a signe
contienith 60 Mynutis, & haue this in Mynde. & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


 

 Next this folwyth the cercle of the dayes, þat ben figured in maner of
degrees, þat contienen in nowmbre 365 ; dyuyded also with longe strikes
fro 5 to 5, & the nombre in Augrym writen vnder þat cercle. and for
more declaracioun, loo heere thy figure.




 

 Next the cercle of tho dayes folweth the Cercle of the names of the
Monthes ; þat is to seyen, Ianuare, Februare, Marcius, Aprile, Mayus,
Iuyn, Iulius, Augustus, Septembre, October, Novembre, Decembre. the
names of thise Monthes were cleped in Arabyens, somme for hir propretes,
& some by statutz of lordes, some by other lordes of Rome. ek of thise
Monthes, as liked to Iulius cesar & to cesar Augustus, some were
compowned of diuerse nombres of dayes, as Iuyl and August. thanne hath
Ianuare xxxi daies, Februare 28, March 31, Aprille 30, May 31, Iunius
30, Iulius 31, Augustus 31, September 30, Octobre 3l, Nouembre 30,
December natheles, althow that Iulius cesar tok 2 daies owt of
Feuerer & put hem in his monith of Iuylle, & Augustus cesar cleped


 

the Monyth of August After his name & ordeyned it of 31 daies, yit
truste wel, þat the sonne dwelleth therfor neuere the more ne lesse in
on signe than in another.


 

 Than folwen the names of the halidayes in the kalender & next hem the
lettres of the A. b. c. on wich they fallen. & for the more
declaracioun, loo here thi figure.




 

 Next the forseide cercle of the A. b. c., vnder the croslyne, is
Marked the skale, in Maner of 2 Squyres or elles in Manere of laddres,
þat seruith by hise 12 poyntes & hise deuisiouns of ful many a subtil
conclusioun. Of this forseide skale, fro the crooslyne vnto the verre
angle, is clepid vmbra , & the nether partie is cleped the vmbra
 & for the more declaracioun, loo here
the figure.


 

 Thanne hastow a brod Rewle, þat hath on either ende a Square plate
perced with a certein holes, some more & some lesse, to resseyuen the
stremes of the sonne by day, and ek by mediacioun of


 

thyn Eye, to knowe the altitude of sterres by nyhte { & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure


 

 Thanne is ther a large Pyn in maner of an Extre, þat goth thorow the
hole that halt the tables of the clymates & the Riet in the wombe of
the Moder thorw wich pyn ther goth a litel wegge which þat is cleped
the hors, þat streynet alle thise parties to hepe ; this forseide
grete Pyn in maner of an extre is ymagynd to be the Pol Artyk in thin
Astralabie. & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.




 

 The wombeside of thyne Astrelabie is also deuyded wit a longe
croys in 4 quarters from est to West, fro sowth to north, fro riht side
to left side, as is the bakside. & for the more declaracioun, lo here
thi figure.


 

 The bordure of which wombeside is deuyded fro the poynt of the est
lyne vnto the poynt of the south lyne vnder the ring, in 90 degres ; &
by þat same proporcioun is euery quarter deuyded as ys the bakside, þat
amonteth 360 degres. & vnderstond wel, þat degres of this Bordure ben
answering & consentrik to the degrees of the Equynoxial, þat ys deuyded
in the same nombre as euery othere cercle is in the heie heuene. This
same bordure is deuyded also with 23 lettres capitals & a smal croys +
aboue the south lyne, þat shewith the 24 howres equals of the clokke 
&, as I haue said, 5 of thise degrees maken a Milewey, & 3 Milewey maken
an howre. & euery degree of this bordure contineth 4 Mynutes, &


 

euery Minut 60 secoundes ; now haue told the twye & for the more
declaracioun, lo here the figure.




 

 The plate vnder thi Riet is descriued with 3 cerclis ; of
wiche the leste is cleped the cercle of cancer bycause þat the heued
of cancer turnyth euermor consentrik vpon the same cercle. in this
heued of cancer is the grettest declinacioun northward of the sonne. &
therfor is he cleped the Solsticioun of somer; wiche declinacioun ,
aftur ptholome, is 23 degrees & 50 Minutis, as wel in cancer as in
Capricorne. this signe of cancre is cleped the tropik of Somer, of
tropos, þat is to seyn Agaynward, for thanne bygynneth the sonne to
passe fro vsward ; & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.



 The Middel cercle in wydnesse, of thise 3, is cleped the cercle
equinoxial vpon whiche turneth euermo the hedes of aries & libra. &
vnderstond wel, þat euermo this cercle equinoxial turnyth Iustly fro
verrey est to verrey west; as I haue shewed the in the sper solide. 
this same cercle is cleped also the weyere, equator, of the day for
whan the sonne is in the heuedes of aries & libra, than ben the daies &
the nyht illike of lenghthe in al the world. & therfore ben thise
two signes called the equinoxiis. & alle þat Moeuyth within the
heuedes of thise aries & libra, his Moeuyng is cleped northward &
alle that Moeuyth withoute thise heuedes, his Moeuyng is clepid sowth
ward as fro the equinoxial. tak kep of thise latitudes north and
sowth, & forget it nat. by this cercle equinoxial ben considered the
24 howres of the clokke ; for eueremo the arisyng of 15 degrees of the
equinoxial maketh an howre equal of the clokke. this equinoxial is cleped


 

the gyrdelle of the firste Moeuyng, or elles of the angulus primi motus
vel primi mobilis. And nota, þat firste Moeuyng is cleped "Moeuyng" of
the firste Moeuable of the 8 spere, whiche Moeuyng is fro est to west, 
& eft agayn into est also it is clepid "girdel" of the first Moeuyng,
for it departeth the furste Moeuable, þat is to seyn, the spere, in 2
ilike parties, euene distantz fro the poles of this world.

The wydeste of thise 3 principal cerkles is cleped the cercle of
capricorne, bycause þat the heued of capricorne turnyth euermo
consentryk vpon the same cercle in the heued of this forseide
capricorne is the grettest declinacioun sowthward of the sonne, & ther
for is it cleped the solsticioun of wyntur. this signe of capricorne is
also cleped the tropik of wyntur, for thanne bygynnyth the sonne to come
agayn to vsward. & for the more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.




 

 Vpon this forseide plate ben compassed certein cerclis þat hihten
Almicanteras of which som of hem semen perfit cercles, & somme semen
inperfit. the centre þat standith aMiddes the narwest cercle is cleped
the senyth; & the netherest cercle, or the furste cercle, is clepid
the orisonte, þat is to seyn, the cercle


 

þat deuydeth the two Emysperies þat is, the partie of the heuene a
boue the Erthe & the partie benethe. thise almykanteras ben
compowned by 2 & 2, al be it so þat on diuers Astrelabies some almy
kanteras ben deuyded by on & some by two, & somme by .3. aftur the
quantite of the Astrelabie. & this forseide cenyth is ymagened to ben
the verrey point ouer the crowne of thyn heued & also this senyth is
the verrey pool of the orisonte in euery regioun. & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


 

 From this senyth, as it semeth, ther come a maner krokede strikes like
to the clawes of a loppe, or elles like to the werk of a womanes calle,
in keruyng ouerthwart the Almykanteras. & thise same strikes or
diuisiouns ben cleped Azymuthz. & they deuyden the Orisonte of thin
astrelabie in 24 deuisiouns. & thise Aȝimutz seruen to knowe the
costes of the firmament & to othre conclusiouns, as for to knowe the
cenyth of the sonne & of euery sterre. & for more declaracioun,
lo here thi figure.




 

 Next thise azymutz, vnder the cercle of Cancer, ben ther 12 deuysiouns
embelif, moche like to the shap of the azimutes, þat shewen the spaces
of the howres of planetes & for mor declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


 

 The riet of thin Astrelabie with thy zokiak, shapen in maner of a net
or of a lopwebbe aftur the olde descripcioun, which thow maist tornen
vp and down as thiself likyth, contienith certein nombre of sterres
fixes, with hir longitudes & latitudes determynat;


 

 ȝif so be þat the makere haue nat erred. the names of the sterres ben
writen in the Margyn of the riet ther as they sitte; Of whiche sterres
the smale poynt is cleped the Centre And vnderstond also þot alle
sterres sittinge wythin the zodiak of thin astrolabie ben cleped
sterres of the north, For thei Arisen by northe the est lyne. & alle
the remenant fixed, owt of the zodiak, ben cleped sterres of the sowth;
 but y sey nat þat they arisen alle by southe the est lyne ; witnesse
on aldeberan & Algomeysa. generally vnderstond this rewle, that thilke
sterres þat ben cleped sterres of the north arisen rather than the
degree of hire longitude, & alle sterres of the sowth arisen aftur
the degree of hire longitude; this is to seyn, sterres fixed in thin
Astralabie. the mesure of this longitude of sterres is taken in the lyne
Eclyptik of heuene, vnder which lyne, whan that the sonne & the Mone ben
lyneriht or elles in the superfice of this lyne than is the Eclips of
the sonne or of the Mone ; as y shal declare, & ek the cause why. but
 sothly the Ecliptik lyne of thy zodiak is the owttereste
bordure of thy zodiak, ther the degrees ben marked.

 Thy zodiak of thin Astralabie is shapen as a compas wich þat
contienith a large brede, as aftur the quantite of thin astralabie in
ensample þat the zodiak in heuene is ymagened to ben a superfice
contienyng a latitude of 12 degrees, wher al the remenant of
cerkles in the heuene ben ymagined verrey lynes withowte eny latitude.
 Amiddes this celestial zodiak ys ymagined a lyne, which þat is cleped
the Ecliptik lyne vndur which lyne is euermo the wey of the sonne. 
Thus ben ther 6 degrees of the zodiak on þat on side of the lyne, and 6
degrees on that other. This zodiak is


 

deuided in 12 principa1 deuisiouns, þat departen the 12 signes. &, for
the streitnes of thin astrelabie, than is euery smal deuysioun in a
signe departid by two degrees & two; I Mene degrees contenyng 60
Minutes. & this forseide heuenissh zodiak is cleped the cercle of the
signes or the cercle of the bestes for zodia in langage of grek
sownyth `bestes' in latyn tonge. & in the zodiak ben the 12 signes þat
han names of bestes; or elles for whan the sonne entrith in any of the
signes, he taketh the proprete of swich bestes ; or elles for þat the
sterres that ben there fixed ben disposed in signes of bestes, or
shape like bestes; or elles whan the planetes ben vnder thilke signes,
þei causen vs by hir influence operaciouns & effectes lik to the
operaciouns of bestes. & vnderstonde Also, þat whan an hot planete
comyth into an hot signe, than encresseth his hete; & ȝif a planete be
cold, thanne amenuseth his coldnesse, bycause of the hote signe. & by
this conclusioun maistow take ensample in alle the signes, be they moist
or drie, or moeble or fix; rekenyng the qualite of the planete as I
furst seide. & euerich of thise 12 Signes hath respecte to a certein
parcelle of the body of a man and hath it in gouernance; as aries hath
thin heued, & taurus thy nekke & thy throte gemyni thyn armholes &
thin armes, & so forth; as shal be shewed more pleyn in the 5 partie
of this tretis. this zodiak, which þat is part of the 8 spere, ouer
kerueth the equinoxial; and he ouerkerueth hym again in euene parties 
& þat on half declinith sowthward, & þat other northward, as pleynli
declareth the tretis of the spere. & for mor declaracioun, lo here thi
figure.




 

 Thanne hastow a label, þat is schapen lik a rewle,


 

saue þat it is streit & hath no plates on either ende with holes ; but
with the smale point of the forseide label, shaltow kalcule thyne
equaciouns in the bordure of thin Astrolabie as bi thin almury. & for
the more declaracioun, lo here thy figure.


 

 Thin almury is cleped the denticle of capricorne or elles the
kalkuler. this same Almury sit fix in the hed of capricorne, & it
seruyth of many a necessarie conclusioun in equaciouns of thynges, as
shal be shewed; & for the more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.

Her endith the descripcion of the Astrelabie.




 Her bygynnen the conclusions of the Astrelabie.


 To fynde the degree in which the sonne is day by day, after
 hir cours abowte.


 

 Rekene and knowe which is the day of thi monthe & ley thi reule vp
that same day, & thanne wol the verray point of thy rewle sitten in the
bordure, vpon the degree of thy sonne. Ensample as thus ; the yer of
oure lord 1391, the 12 day of March at Midday, I wolde knowe the degree
of the sonne. I sowhte in the bakhalf of myn astrelabie, and fond the
sercle of the daies, the which I knowe by the names of the Monthes
writen vndur the same Cercle. Tho leide I my rewle ouer this forseide
day, & fond the


 

point of my rewle in the bordure vpon the firste degree of aries, A
litel within the degree & thus knowe I this conclusioun. Another
day, I wolde knowe the degree of my sonne, & this was at Midday in the
 day of decembre ; I fond the day of the monthe in maner as I seide 
tho leide I my rewle vpon this forseide day, & found the point of
my rewle in the bordure vpon the first degree of capricorne a lite
within the degree & than haddy of this conclusioun the ful
experience & for the more declaracioun, lo her thi figure.




 To knowe the altitude of the sonne, or of othre celestial bodies.


 

 Put the ring of thin Astrelabie vpon thi riht thowmbe & turne thi
lift side agayn the light of the sonne And remue thi rewle vp and
down til þat the stremes of the sonne shyne thorgh bothe holes of thi
rewle. loke thanne how Many degrees thi rewle is areised fro the
litel crois vpon thin est line, & tak ther the altitude of thi sonne. 
& in this same wyse maistow knowe by nyhte the altitude of the Mone, or
of brihte sterres this chapitre is so general euer in on, þat ther
nedith no more declaracion; but forget it nat. & for the more
declaracioun, lo here the figure.




 To knowe euery tyme of the day by liht of the sonne, & euery
 tyme of the nyht by the sterres fixe, & eke to knowe by nyht or
 by day the degree of any signe þat assendith on the est
 Orisonte, which þat is cleped communly the assendent or elles
 oruscupum.


 


 

 Tak the altitude of the sonne whan the list, as I haue said ; & set
the degree of the sonne, in kas þat it be byforn the Middel of the day,
among thin almykanteras on the est side of thin astralabie ; & ȝif it
be after the Middel of the day, set the degree of thy sonne vpon the
west side tak this manere of settyng for a general rewle, ones for
euere. & whan thow hast set the degree of thy sonne vp as many
Almykanteras of heyhte as was the altitude of the sonne takyn by thi
rewle, ley ouer thi label, vpon the degree of the sonne; & thanne
wol the point of thi label siten in the bordure, vpon the verrey tid
of the day. Ensample as thus the yer of owre lord 1391, the 12 day of
March, I wold knowe the tyd of the day. I tok the altitude of my sonne,
 & fond þat it was 25 degrees and 30 of Minutes of heyhte in the
bordure on the bakside. tho turnede I Myn astrelabie, & by cause that
it was byforn̄ Midday, I turnede Mi riet and sette the degree of the
sonne, that is to seyn the .1. degree of Aries on the riht side of myn
Astralabie, vpon þat 25 degrees & 30 of Minutes of heyhte among myn
almykanteras tho leide I my label vpon the degree of my sonne, &
fond the poynte of my label in the bordure, vpon a capital
lettre þat is cleped an X; tho rekened I alle the capitalles lettres fro
the lyne of Midnyght vnto this forseide lettre X, & fond þat it was 9
of the clokke of the day. tho loked I don vpon the Est Orisonte, and
fond there the 20 degree of gemynis assending ;


 

which þat I tok for Myn assendent. & in this wyse hadde I the experience
for euermo in wich maner I sholde knowe the tyde of the day & ek myn
assendent. Tho wold I wyte the same nyght folwyng the howr of the
nyght & wrowhte in this wyse among an hep of sterris fixe, it liked
me for to take the altitude of the feire white sterre þat is cleped
Alhabor and fond hir sitting on the west side of the line of Midday,
18 degres of heyhte taken by my rewle on the bakside. tho sette I the
centre of this Alhabor vpon 18 degrees among myn Almykanteras, vpon
the west side ; by cause þat she was fonden on the west side. tho leide
I my label ouer the degree of the sonne þat was descended vnder the
weste Orisonte, & rikened alle the lettres capitals fro the lyne of
Midday vnto þe point of my label in the bordure; & fond þat it was
passed 8 of the clokke the space of 2 degrees tho loked I doun vpon
myn est orisonte, & fond ther 23 degrees of libra assending, whom I
tok for myn assendent; & thus lerned I to knowe ones for euer in which
Manere I shuld come to the howre of the nyht and to myn assendent; as
verreyli as may be taken by so smal instrument but natheles in
general wold I warne the for euere ne mak the neuere bold to haue take
a Iust Ascendent by thin Astrilabie, or elles to haue sette Iustly a
clokke, whan any celestial body by which þat thow wenest gouer e thilke
thynges ben ney the sowth lyne for trust wel, whan þat þe sonne is ney
the Meridional lyne, the degree of the sonne rennyth so longe consentrik
vpon the almykanteras, þat sothly thow shalt erre fro the Iust
assendent the same conclusioun sey I by þe centre of any sterre fix by
nyht; and moreouer, by experience, I wot wel that in owre Orisonte,
from .xi. of the clokke vnto on of the


 

clokke, in takyng of a Iust assendent in A portatif Astrelabie, hit is
to hard to knowe. I mene, from .xi. of the clokke byforn the howre of
noon til on of the clok next folwyng. & for the more declaracion, lo
her thi figure.




 Special declaracion of the assendent.


 

 The assendent sothly, as wel in alle natiuitez as in questiouns &
elecciouns of tymes, is a thing which þat thise Astrologiens gretly
obseruen wherfore me semeth conuenient, sin þat I speke of the
assendent, to make of it special declaracioun The assendent sothly, to
take it at the , is thilke degree þat assendith at any of
thise forseide tymes vn the est Orisonte; & therefor, yif þat any
planet assende at þat same tyme in thilke forseide his
longitude, Men seyn þat thilke planete is in horoscopo. but sothly,
the hows of the assendent, þat is to seyn, the firste hous or the est
Angle, is a thing more brod & large. For after the statutz of
Astrologiens, what celestial body þat is 5 degres aboue thilk degre þat
assendith, or within þat nowmbre, þat is to seyn, nere the degree þat
assendith yit rikne thei thilke planet in the Assendent. And what
planete þat is vnder thilke degree þat assendith the space of 
degrees, yit sein thei that thilke planete is lyk to him þat is 
the hows of the assendent but sothly, yif he passe the bondes of thise
forseide spaces, aboue or bynethe, they sein þat the planete is
failling fro the assendent; yit sein thise Astrologens, that the
assendent & eke the lord of the assendent, may be shapen for to be
fortunat or infortunat as thus a fortunat assendent clepen they whan
þat no wykkid planete, as saturne or Mars, or elles the tail of the
dragoun, is in hows of the assendent, ne þat no wikked
planete haue non aspecte of enemyte vpon the assendent ; but they wol
caste þat thei haue a fortunat planete in hir assendent & ȝit in his
felicite, & than sey they þat it is wel. fortherouer,


 

they seyn þat the infortunyng of an assendent is the contrarie of this
forseide thinges. the lord of the assendent sey they þat he is
fortunat, whan he is in god place fro the assendent as in angle; or in a
succedent, whereas he is in his dignite & conforted with frendly

spirit ne hath no feith, ne no knowyng of hir horoscopum; for they seyn
þat euery signe is departid in 3 euene parties by degrees, & thilke

& set thilke Middel degree vpon thin est Orisonte ; & waite thanne
what degre þat sit vpon the line Meridional, & tak ther the verrey
degre of the Ecliptik in which the sterre stondeth for the tyme. For
in the Ecliptik is the longitude of a celestial body rekened, euene fro
the heued of aries vnto ende of pisces. & his latitude is
Rikned after the quantite of is declinacion, north or sowth towarde
þe poles of this world as thus. yif it be of the sonne or of any fix
sterre rekene is latitude or his declinacioun fro thu Equinoxial

latitude fro the Ecliptik lyne. Al be it so þat fro Equinoxial
may the declinacion or the latitude of any body celestial be rikned,
after the site north or south, & after the quantite of is
declinacion. & riht so may the latitude or the declinacion of any body
celestial, saue only of the sonne, after his site north or south, &
after the quantite of his declinacioun, be rekned fro the Ecliptik
lyne ; Fro which lyne alle planetes som tyme declinen north or south,
saue only the forseide sonne. & for the more declaracioun, lo here

 To knowe the degrees of the longitudes of fixe sterres after
 þat they ben determinat in thin astralabie, yif so be þat they
 ben trewly set.


 

 Set the centre of the sterre vpon the lyne Meridional, & tak kep of
thi zodiak, & loke what degree of any signe þat sit on the same lyne
Meridional at þat same tyme, & tak the degree in which the sterre
standith ; & with that same degree comth þat same sterre vnto that
same lyne fro the Orisonte. & for more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.

 Set the Sentre of the sterre vpon the est Orisonte, & loke what
degre of any signe þat sit vp on the same Orisonte at þat same tyme. 
And vnderstond wel, þat with þat same degre arisith þat same sterre ;
and thys merueyllous arising with a strange degree in
another signe is bycause þat the latitude of the sterre fix is either
north or sowth fro the equinoxial. but sothly, the latitudes


 

of planetes ben comuly rekned fro the Ecliptik, bicause þat non of
hem declinet but fewe degrees owt fro the brede of the zodiak. &
tak god kep of this chapitre of arising of the celestial bodies ; for
truste wel, þat neyther mone ne sterre as in owre Embelif orisonte
arisith with þat same degree of his longitude, saue in O cas; & that
is, whan they haue no latitude fro the Ecliptik lyne. but natheles som

in the forseide lyne, & set ther a prikke. turne vp thanne thy Riet,
and set the heued of aries or libra in the same Meridional lyne, & set
ther another prikke. & whan þat this is don, considere the Altitudes of hem bothe ; for sothly the difference of thilke
altitudes is the declinacion of thilke degre fro the equinoxial. & yif
so be þat thilke degree be northward fro the equinoxial, than is his
declinacion north ; yif it be sowthward, than is it sowth. & for the
more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


 


 To knowe for what latitude in any regioun the Almikanteras
 of any table ben compowned.


 

 Rikne how manie degrees of Almikanteras in the Meridional lyne be fro

 To knowe in special the latitude of owre countray, I mene
 after the latitude of Oxenford, & the heyhte of owre pol.


 

Vnderstond wel, þat as fer is the heued of aries or libra in the
equinoxial from owre orisonte as is the cenyth fro the pole artik ; &
as hey the pol Artik fro the Orisonte as the Equinoxial is fer fro
the senyth. I proue it thus by the latitude of Oxenford vnderstond
wel, þat the heyhte of owre pool Artik fro owre north Orisonte is 51
degrees & 50 Minutes; than is the cenyth from owre pool Artik 38 degrees
& l0 Minutes; than is the equinoxial from owre senyth 51 degrees & 50
Minutes; than is owre south Orisonte from owre equinoxial 38 degrees &
l0 Minutes. vnderstond wel


 

this Reknyng. Also forget nat þat the cenyth is 90 degrees of heyhte
fro the Orisonte, & owre equinoxial is 90 degrees from owre pool Artik.
 Also this shorte rewle is soth, þat the latitude of any place in a
regioun is the distance fro the senyth vnto the Equinoxial. & for more
declaracioun, lo here þi figure.


 To proue euidently the latitude of any place in a Regioun,
 by the preue of the heyhte of the pol Artik in þat same place.


 

In some wynters nyht, whan the firmament is clere & thikke sterred 
waite a tyme til þat any sterre fix sit lyneriht perpendiculer ouer
 the pol Artik, & clepe þat sterre A. & wayte another
sterre þat sit lyneriht vnder A, & vnder the pol & clepe þat sterre
F. And vnderstond wel, þat F is nat consideret but only declare þat
A sit euene ouere the pool. tak thanne anon riht the altitude of A
from the Orisonte & forget it nat. Lat A & F go farwel til agayns
the dawenyng a gret while & come thanne agayn & Abid til þat A is
euene vnder the pol & vnder F ; for sothly, than wole F sit ouer the
pool & A wol sit vnder the pool. tak than eftsones the altitude of
A from the Orisonte & note as wel is secounde altitude as his
furste Altitude & whan þat this is don, rikne how manye degrees þat
the firste altitude of A excedith his seconde altitude, & tak half
thilke porcioun þat is excedit, & adde it to his seconde altitude ; &
tak ther the eleuacioun of thi pool, & eke the latitude of thy regioun ;
 for thise two ben of a nombre ; this is to seyn, as many degrees as
thy pool is eleuat so michel


 

is the latitude of the Regioun. Ensample as thus: par auenture the
altitude of A in the euenyng is 56 degrees of heyte than wol his seconde
altitude or the dawyng be 48 þat is lasse than 56, þat was his
furste altitude at euen. take thanne the of 8 & adde it to 48, þat
was is seconde altitude, and hastow now hastow the
heyhte of thy pol and the latitude of the regioun but vnderstond wel
þat to proue this conclusioun & many another fair conclusioun, thow
most haue a plomet hanging on a lyne heyer than thin heued on a perche 
& thilke lyne mot hange euene perpendiculer bytwixe the pool & thin
eye & thanne shaltow sen yif A sitte euene ouer the pool & ouer F at
euene & also yif F sitte euene ouer the pool & ouer A or day. & for
more declaracion, lo here thi figure.




 Another conclusioun to proue the heyhte of the pool Artik
 fro the orisonte.


 

Tak any sterre fixe þat neuere dissendith vnder the Orisonte in thilke
regioun, & considere his heiest altitude & his lowest Altitude fro the
Orisonte ; & make a nombre of bothe thise altitudes ; tak thanne &
abate half þat nombre, & tak þer the eleuacioun of the pol Artik in þat
same Regioun & for more declaracioun, lo here thi figure.


 


 Another conclusioun to proue the latitude of the Regioun, &c.


 

 Vnderstond wel þat the latitude of any place in A Regioun is verreyly
the space bytwixe the senythe of hem þat dwellen there & 
equinoxial cerkle, north or sowthe, takyng the mesure in the Meridional
lyne, as shewith in the Almykanteras of thin Astrelabie. & thilke
space is as moche as the pool artik is hey in the same place fro the
Orisonte. And than is the depressioun of the pol antartik, þat is to
seyn, than is the pol antartik bynethe the Orisonte the same quantite
of space, neither mor ne lasse. thanne, yif thow desire to knowe this
latitude of the Regioun, tak the altitude of the sonne in the Middel of
the day, whan the sonne is in the heuedes of aries or of libra for
thanne Moeuyth the sonne in the lyne equinoxial ; & abate the nombre
of that same sonnes Altitude owt of 90, & thanne is the remenaunt of the noumbre þat leuyth the latitude of the Regioun, as thus : I
suppose that the sonne is thilke day at noon 38 degrees And l0 minutes
of heyhte. Abate thanne thees degrees And minutes owt of 90 ; so leueth
there 51 degrees and 50 minutes, the latitude. I sey nat this but for
ensample ; for wel I wot the latitude of Oxenforde is certein minutes
lasse, as y myght proue. Now yif so be þat the semith to long a
tarienge, to abide til þat sonne be in the heuedes of aries or of
libra, thanne whaite whan the sonne is in any other degree of the
zodiak, & considere the degree of is declinacion fro the equinoxial
lyne ; & yif it so be þat the sonnes declinacion be northward fro the
equinoxial, abate thanne fro the sonnes altitude at noon the nombre


 

of his declinacion, & thanne hastow the heyhte of the heuedes of aries
& libra ; as thus My sonne is, par Auenture, in þe firste degre of
leoun, 58 degrees and 10 Minutes of heyhte at noon & his declinacion
is almost 20 degrees northward fro the equinoxial ; abate thanne thilke
20 degrees of declinacion owt of the altitude at noon, than leueth the
38 degrees and odde Minutes ; lo ther the heued of aries or libra, &
thin equinoxial in that Regioun. Also yif so be þat the sonnes
declinacioun be sowthward fro the Equinoxial, Adde thanne thilke
declinacion to the altitude of the sonne at noon and tak ther the
heuedes of aries & libra & thin Equinoxial. abate thanne the heyhte of
the Equinoxial owt of 90 degrees, & thanne leuyth there þe distans of
the pole, 51 degrees & 50 Minutes, of that regioun fro the Equinoxial. 
Or elles yif the lest, take the haiest altitude fro the equinoxial of
any sterre fix that thow knowest, & tak his nethere elongacioun
lengthing fro the same equinoxial lyne, & wirke in the maner forseid. 
& for more declaracion, lo here thi figure.




 Declaracioun of the assensioun of signes, &c.


 

The excellence of the spere solide, amonges other noble conclusiouns,

writen þat thilke signe is clept of riht Ascensioun, with which more
part of the cercle Equinoxial & lasse part of the zodiak ascendith &
thilke signe assendith Embelif, with whiche lasse part of the Equinoxial
and more part of the zodiak assendith.


 

 & euere mo the Arch of the day & the arch of
the nyht is ther ylike long, & the sonne twyes euery yer passinge thorow

 Take the altitude of thy sonne whan the list & note wel the quarter
of the world in which the sonne is for the tyme by the Azymutz. turne
thanne thin Astrolabie & set the degree of the sonne in the
Almykanteras of his altitude on thilke side þat the sonne stant as is
the manere in takyng of howres ; & ley thy label on the degree of the
sonne, And rikene how many degres of the bordure ben bytwixe the lyne
Meridional & the point of thy label; & note wel þat nowmbre. Turne thanne agayn thyn Astralabie, & set the point of thy gret
Rewle ther thow takest thyne Altitudes vpon as many degrees in his
bordure fro his Meridional as was the point of thy label fro the lyne
Meridional on the wombeside. tak thanne thyn Astrolabie with bothe
handes sadly & slely, & lat the sonne shyne thorow bothe holes of thy
rewle; & sleyly in thilke shynynge lat thyn Astrelabie kowch adown

 To knowe the Altitude of planetes fro the wey of the sonne,
 whether so they be north or sowth fro the forseide wey.


 

 Lok whan þat a planete is in the lyne Meridional, yif þat hir altitude
be of the same heyhte þat is the degree of the sonne for þat day, & than
is the planete in the verrey wey of the sonne, & hath no latitude. &
yif the altitude of the planete be heyere than the degree of the sonne,
þan is the planete north fro the wey of the sonne swych a quantite of
latitude as by thyn Almykanteras. & ȝif the altitude of the
planete be lasse than the degree of the sonne thanne is the
planete sowth fro the wey of the sonne swich a quantite of latitude as
 by thin almykanteras ; This is to seyn, fro the wey wher as
the sonne wente thilke day but nat from the wey of the sonne in euery
place of the zodiak. & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


 To knowe the senyth of the arysing of the sonne, this is to

 Thow most first considere þat the sonne ariseth nat alwey verrey est,
but some tyme by north the est, and som tyme by sowthe


 

the est Sothly the sonne ariseth neuermo verrey est in owere
Orisonte, but he be in the heued of aries or libra. now is thin
Orisonte departed in 24 parties by thi azymutz, in significacion of 24
partiez of the world; al be it so þat shipmen rikne thilke partiez in
32 thanne is ther no more but waite in which azymut þat thi sonne
entreth at is arisyng & take ther the senyth of the arising of the
sonne. the manere of the deuisioun of thin Astralabie is this I Mene
as in this cas. First is it deuided in 4 plages principalx with the
lyne þat goth from est to west, & than with another lyne þat goth fro
soth to north. than is it deuided in smale partiez of Azymutz, as
est, and est by sowthe, whereas is the firste Azimut aboue the est
lyne ; & so forth fro partie to partie til þat thow come agayn vnto
the est lyne thus maistow vnderstond also the senyth of any sterre, in
which partie he riseth, &c. & for the more declaracion, lo here the
figure.




 To knowe in which partie of the firmament is the coniunccioun.


 

 Considere the tyme of the coniunccon by thy kalender as thus ;
lok how many howres thilke coniunccion is fro the Midday of


 

the day precedent, as shewith by the canoun of thi kalender; rikne
thanne thilke nombre of howres in the bordure of thyn Astralabie as
thow art wont to do in knowyng of the howres of the day or of the nyht;
 & ley thy label ouer the degree of the sonne; & thanne wol the point
of thy label sitte vpon the hour of the con iunccion. loke thanne in
which Azymut the degree of thy sonne sittith, & in that partie of the
firmament is the coniunccioun. & for the more declaracioun, lo here
thy figure.




 To knowe the senyth of the Altitude of the sonne, &c.


 

This is no mor to seyn but any tyme of the day tak the altitude of the
sonne, & by the Azymut in which he stondith, Maistou sen in which
partie of the firmament he is & the same wyse maistou sen, by the
nyht, of any sterre, wheither the sterre sitte est or west or north, or
any partie bytwene, aftur the name of the Azimut in which is the
sterre. & for the more declaracioun, lo here the figure.


 To knowe sothly the degree of the longitude of the mone, or
 of any planete þat hath no latitude for the tyme fro the
 Ecliptik lyne.


 


 

 Tak the altitude of the mone, & rikne thin altitude vp among thyne
Almykanteras on which side that the Mone stande, & set there a prikke. 
Tak thenne anon riht, vpon the mones side, the Altitude of any sterre
fix which þat thow knowest, & set his Centre vpon his altitude Among
thin Almykanteras ther the sterre is fownde. Waite thanne which degree
of the zodiak the prikke of the altitude of the mone, & tak
ther the degree in which the mone standith. this conclusioun is verrey
soth, yif the sterres in thin Astrolabie stonden aftur the
trowthe ; of comune, tretis of Astralabie ne make non excepcioun
wheyth the mone haue latitude, or non ne on wheither side of the
mone the Altitude of the sterre fix be taken. And nota, þat yif the
Mone himself by liht of day, than maistow wyrke this same
conclusioun by the sonne, as wel as by the fix sterre. & for the more
declaracioun, lo here thy figure.


 This is the workinge of the conclusioun, to knowe yif þat
 any planete be directe or retrograde.


 

 Tak the altitude of any sterre þat is cleped a planete, & note it
wel. & tak ek anon the altitude of any sterre fix that thow


 

knowest, & note it wel also. Come thanne agayn the thridde or the
ferthe nyht next folwyng ; for thanne shaltow aperceyue wel the Moeuyng
of a planete, wheither so he Moeue forthward or bakward. Awaite wel
thanne wan þat thi sterre fix is in the same altitude þat she was
wan thow toke hir firste altitude ; and tak than eftsones the
Altitude of the forseide planete, & note it wel. for trust wel, yif so
be þat the planete be on the riht side of the Meridional lyne, so þat
his seconde altitude be lasse than is firste altitude was, thanne is
the planete directe. And yif he be on the west side in that
condicion thanne is he retrograd. And yif so be þat this planete be
vpon the Est side whan is altitude is taken, so þat his
secounde altitude be more than is firste altitude, thanne is he
retrograde, & yif he be on the west side, than is he directe. but the
contrarie of this parties is of the cours of the Moone ; for 
the Moone Moeuyth the contrarie from othere planetes as in hire
Episicle, but in non other manere. & for the more declaracioun, lo
here thi figure.

 To knowe with which degree of the zodiak þat any planete
 Assendith on the Orisonte, wheyther so that his latitude be
 north or sowth.

 Knowe be thin almenak the degree of the Ecliptik of any signe in which
þat the planete is rekned for to be & that is cleped the degree of his
longitude; & knowe Also the degree of his latitude fro the Ecliptik,
north or sowth. And by this samples folwynge in special maistow
wyrke for in euery signe of the zodiak. the degree of
 par auenture, of venus or of another planete was 6 of
Capricorne, & the latitude of him was northward 2 degrees fro the
Ecliptik lyne. I tok a subtil compas, & cleped þat on poynt of my compas
A, & þat other poynt F. Than I the point of A, & set it in 
Ecliptik line euene in my zodiak, in the degree of the longitude of
venus þat is to seyn, in the 6 degree of Capricorne & thanne set I
the point of F vpward in the same signe, bycause þat the
latitude was north, vpon the latitude of venus, that is to seyn, in the
6 degree fro the heued of capricorne; & thus hauy 2 degrees bytwixe my
to prikkes; than leide I down softely my compas, & sette the degree of
the longitude vpon the Orisonte tho tok I & wexede my label in Maner
of a peyre tables to resceyue distynctly the prikkes of my compas. Tho
tok I this forseide label, & leide it fix ouer the degree of my
longitude tho tok I vp my compas, & sette the point of A in the wex
on my label, as euene as y kowde gesse ouer the Ecliptik lyne, in the
ende of longitude & sette the point of F endlang in my label vp
on the space of the latitude, inwarde & ouer the zodiak, that


 

is to seyn, northward fro the Ecliptik than leide I down my compas &
lokede wel in the wey vpon the prikke of A & of F; tho turned I my Riet
til þat the prikke of F sat vpon the Orisonte than saw I wel þat the
body of venus, in hir latitude of degrees septentrionalis, assendid,
in the ende of the 6 degree, in the heued of capricorne. And nota, þat
in the same maner maistow wyrke with any latitude septentrional signes ; but sothly the latitude Meridional of a planete in
Capricorne may not be take, by cause of the litel space bytwixe the
Ecliptik & the bordure of the Astrelabie; but sothly, in alle other
 it May.



 Also the degree, par auenture, of Iuppiter or of another planete, was
in the furst degree of pisces in longitude & his latitude was 3
degrees Meridional; tho tok I the point of A & set it in the firste
degree of pisces on the Ecliptik & thanne set I the point of F
downward in the same signe, by cause þat the latitude was sowth 3
degrees þat is to seyn̄, fro the heued of pisces & thus hauy 3
degrees bytwixe bothe prikkes ; thanne sette I the degree of the
longitude vpon the Orisonte; tho tok I my label & leide it fix vpon
the degree of the longitude; tho sette I the point of A on my label,
euene ouer the Ecliptik lyne in the ende euene of the degree of the
longitude & set the point of in my label the space 3
 of the latitude fro the zodiak, this is to seyn, sowthward fro
the Ecliptik, toward the bordure; and turned my


 

Riet the prikke of F sat vpon the Orisonte; thanne I wel
þat the body of Iuppiter, in his latitude of 3 degrees Meridional,
ascendit with 14 degrees of pisces in horoscopo & in this Maner
maistow wyrke with any latitude Meridional, as I first seide, saue in
Capricorne And yif thow wolt pleie this craft with the arisyng of the
Mone, loke thow rekne wel her cours howre by howre; for she ne dwellith
nat in a degree of longitude but litel while, as thow wel
knowest but natheles, yif thow rekne hir verreye Moeuyng by thy tables
howre after howre—— þe & þe tour to þe altitude of þe tour. 4 is
þe ridde part of 12, so is þe space betwen þe & þe tour þe þridde
part of þe altitude of þe tour; þan þries 20 feet ys þe heyȝte of þe
tour, wiþ addyng of þyn owne persone to þyn eye; & þis rewle is so
general in vmbra recta, fro þe poyn of oon to And ȝif þi rewle
falle vppon 5, þan is 5 12partyes of þe heyȝt þe space betwen þe & þe

 Vmbra Versa.

Anoþer maner of werkynge, be vmbra versa. Ȝif so be þat þou may nat come

& aftyrward, whan þou hym at 2, þer þou settest anoþer prikke,
þan þou fyndest betwen too prikkys fett; þan þou schalt fynde þat

Rewle vppon till þou see þe altitude, & sette at þi foot a prikke.
þan sette þi Rewle vppon 2, & beholde what ys þe diffrense betwen 1

And note, ȝif it were 5, yt were þe 5 party of 12 ; & 7, 7 party of 12 ;

 Another maner conclusion, to knowe the mene mote & þe
 argumentis of any planete. To know the mene mote & the
 argumentis of euery planete fro ȝere to ȝere, from day to day,
 from owre to owre, And from smale fraccionis infinite.


 

In this maner shalt þou worche: consider thy rote furst, the
wyche is made the begynning of the tabelis fro the ȝere of owre lord
1397, & entere hit into thy slate for the laste merydye of December;
and þan consider þe ȝere of ovre lord, what is þe date, & behold wheþer
thy date be more or lasse þan þe ȝere And yf hit so be þat hit be
more, loke how many hit passith, & with so many entere into thy
tabelis in þe furst lyne þer as is wreten anni collecti & expansi. And
loke the same planet is wreten in the hede of thy tabele, and
than what þou findest in directe of the same ȝere of owre lord
wyche is passid, be hit 8, or 9, or 10, 40, or And that þou fyndest in
directe in thy slate vnder thy rote, & adde hit , and
þat is thy mene mote, for the laste meridian of the december, for the
same ȝere wyche þat þou purposid. And yf hit so be hit
passe 20, consider welle þat fro to 20 ben anni expansi, And fro 20
to 3000 ben anni collecti; and yf thy nombere passe 20, þan take þat þou
findest in directe of 20, & yf hit be more, as 6 or 18, than take þat
þou findist in directe thereof, that is to sayen, signes, degreis,
Minutes, & secundis, and adde vnto thy rote; and thus to
make rotes; and note,


 

þat yf hit so be the ȝere of ovre lord be 
than the rote, wyche is the ȝere of ovre lord 1397, than shalt þou write
in the same wyse furst thy rote in thy slate, and after entere into thy
table in the same ȝere be lasse, as I tauȝth before; and þan
consider how many signes, degrees, Minutes, & secundis thyne entrynge
conteynith. And so be that be 2 entres, than adde hem togeder, &
after withdrawe hem from the rote, the ȝere of ovre lord 1397; and the
residue þat lewyth is thy mene mote fro the laste merdie of December,
the wyche þou haste purposid; and yf hit so be þat þou wolt weten thy
mene mote eny day, or ony fraccion of day, in þis maner þou
shalt worche. make thy rote fro the laste day of Decembere in þe maner
as I thaȝthe, and afterward behold how many monythis, dayes, & howris
ben passid from merydye of Decembere & with that entere 
laste moneth þat is ful passid, and take þat þou findest in directe of
hym, & wryte hit in thy slate; & entere with as mony dayes as be more,
and wryte þat þou findest in directe of the same planete þat þou
worchyst fore; and in þe same wyse into þe table of howris, for hovris
þat ben passid, and adde alle these to thy rote; and the 
residue is the mene mote for the same day & þe same hovre.


 Another manere to knowe the mene mote.

Whan þou wolte make the mene mote of eny planete to be by arsechieles
tables, take thy rote, the wyche is for the ȝere of ovre lord 1397; and
yf so be that thy ȝere be passid the date, wryte that date and than
write that nombere of the ȝeris. þan wythdrawe þe ȝeris oute of the
ȝeris that ben passid that rote. Ensampulle as thus : the ȝere of ovre
lord 1400, Iwryton precise, my rote; þan wrote I


 

furst And vnder that nombere I wrote a 1397; þan withdrowe I the
laste nombere owte of þat, and þan fond I þe residue was 3 ȝere; I wyst
þat 3 ȝere was passid fro the rote, þe wyche was wreten in my tabelis.
Than afterward soȝth I in my tabelis þe annis col1ectis & expansis, &
amonge myne expanse ȝeris fond I 3 ȝere. þan toke I alle þe signes,
degreis, & minutes, þat I fond directe vnder þe same planete þat I
wroȝth fore, & wrote so many signes degreis, & Minutes in my slate, &
afterward added I too signes, degreis, Minutes, & Secundis, þe wiche I
fond in my rote the ȝere of owre lord 1397; And kepte the residue; & þan
had I the mene mote for þe laste day of Decembere. And yf þou woldest
wete þe mene mote ofany planete in March, Aprile, or may, oþer in any
oþer tyme or monyth of the ȝere, loke how many monethes & dayes ben passid from þe laste day of Decembere, the ȝere of owre lord
1400; and soe with monithis & dayes entere into þy table þer þou
findist thy mene mote Iwreten in monethis & dayes, and take alle þe
signes, degrees, Minutes, & secundis þat þou findest Iwrete in directe
of thy monethis, and to signes, degreis, Minutes, & secundis þat
þou findest with thy rote þe ȝere of ovre lord 1400, and the residue þat
leuyth is þe mene mote for that same day. And note yf hit so be that þou
woldest mene mote in ony ȝere þat is lasse þan thy rote, with
drawe þe nombere of so many ȝeris as hit is lasse þan þe ȝere of ovre
lord a 1397, & kepe þe residue; & so many ȝeris, monythis, & dayes

 Vmbra Recta.



Ȝif þi rewle falle vppon þe 8 poynt on riȝt schadwe, þan make þi figure
of 8; þan loke how moche space of feet ys betwen þe & þe tour, &
multiplie þat be 12, & whan þou multiplied it, þan diuide yt be
þe same nombre of 8, & kepe þe residue, & adde þerto 4 vp to þyn eye to
þe residue, & þat schal be þe verry heyȝt of þe tour. & þus mayst þou
werke on þe same wyse, fro 1 to 


 Vmbra Recta.

Anoþer maner of werkyng vppon þe same syde. Loke vppon whych poynt þi
Rewle falliþ whan þou seest þe top of þe tour þorow too litil holes, &
mete þan þe space fro þi foot to þe baas of þe tour; & ryȝt 
as the nombre of þy poynt hath hymself to 12, ryȝt so þe mesure betwen
þe & þe tour haþ hymself to þe heiȝte of þe same tour. Ensample : y
sette caas þi rewle falle vpon 8, þan ys 8 toþridd partyes of 12; so þe
space ys þe tooþridd partyes of þe tour.


 Vmbra Versa.

To knowe þe poyntes of umbra versa. Ȝif þy rewle falle
vppon 3, whan þou seest þe top of þe tour sett a prikke þereas þi
foot stont; & goo ner tyl þou mayst see þe same top at þe poynt of 4, &
sette þer anoþer lyk prikke þan mete how many foot ben betwen þe too
prikkis, & adde þe lengþe vp to þyn eye þerto ; & þat schal be þe
heyȝte of þe tour. And note, þat 3 ys fourþe party of 12, & 4 is þe
þridde party of Now passeþ 4 þe nombre of 3 be þe distaunce of 1;
þerfore þe same space, wyþ þyn heyȝt to


 

þyn eye, ys þe heyȝt of þe tour. & ȝif it so be þat þer be 2 or 3
distaunce in þe nombres, so schulde þe mesures betwen þe prikkes be
twyes or þries þe heyȝte of þe tour.


 Ad cognoscendum altitudinem alicuius rei per vmbram .



To knowe þe heyȝte of þynges, ȝif þou mayst come to þe bas of a
þyng. sette þy rewle vppon what þou wylt, so þat þou may see þe topp of
þe þyng þorw þe too holes, & make a marke þer þy foot standeþ; and goo
neer or forþer till þou mayst see þorw anoþer poynt, & marke þer a
noþer marke; & loke þan what ys þe differense betwen þe too poyntes in
þe scale; & riȝt as þat difference haþ hym to 12, riȝt so þe space be
twen þe & þe too markys haþ hym to þe heyȝte of þe þyng. Ensample : y
set caas þou seest it þorw a poynt of 4 ; aftyr, at þe poynt of Now
passiþ þe nombre of 4 þe nombre of 3 be þe difference of 1, and riȝt as
þis difference 1 haþ hymself to 12, riȝt so þe mesure betwen þe too
markis haþ hym to þe heyȝte of þe þyng, puttyng to þe heyȝte of þiself
to þyn eye ; & þus mayst þou werke fro 1 to 


 Per vmbram versam.

Furþermore, ȝif þou wilt knowe in vmbra versa be þe craft of vmbra
recta, y suppose þou take þe altitude at þe poynt of 4, & makest a
marke, & þou goost neer tyl þou hast yt at þe poynt of 3, & þan makyst
 þou þer annoþer mark. þan muste þou deuide 144 be eche of þe
poyntes befornseyd, þus : ȝif þou deuide 144


 

be & þe nombre þat comeþ þerof schal be 36, & ȝif þou deuide 144
be 3, & þe nombre þat comeþ þerof schal be 48, þanne loke what ys þe
difference betwen 36 & 48, & þer schalt þou fynde 12; and ryȝt as 12
haþ hym to 12, ryȝt so þe space betwen too prikkes haþ hym to þe
altitude of þe þyng.


 For to knowe at what houre of þe day, or of the night, shal
 be Flode or ebbe.

First wite thou certeinly, how that haven stondith, that thou list to
werke fore ; þat is to say in whiche place of the firmament the mone
beyng, makiþ fulle see. Than awayte þou redily in what degree of þe
zodiak þat þe mone at þat tyme is ynne. Bringe furth than þe labelle, &
sett the point therof in þat same cost þat the mone makiþ flode, and
sett þou þere þe degre of þe mone according wiþ þe egge of þe label.
Than afterward awayte where is than þe degre of the sonne, at þat tyme.
Remeue þou than þe label fro the mone, & bringe & sette iustly vpon
þe degre of þe sonne. And þe point of þe label shal þan declare to þe,
at what houre of þe day or of þe night shal be flode. And þere also
maist þou wite by þe same point of þe label, wheþir it be, at þat same,
flode or ebbe, or half flode, or quarter flode, or ebbe, or half or
quarter ebbe ; or ellis at what houre it was last, or shalbe next by
night or by day, þou þan esely


 

knowe, etc. Furþermore if it so be þat thou happe to worke for þis
matere aboute þe tyme of coniunccioun, bringe furþe þe degre of þe mone
wiþ þe labelle to þat coste as it is before seyde. but than þou shalt
vnderstonde þat þou may not bringe furþe þe label fro þe degre of þe
mone as þou dide before; Forwhy the sonne is þan in þe same degre with
the mone. And so þou may at þat tyme by þe point of the labelle
vnremevid knowe þe houre of þe flode or of þe ebbe as it is before seyd,
&c. And euermore as þou findest þe mone passe fro þe sonne, so remeve
þou þe labelle þan fro þe degre of þe mone, and bringe it to the degre
of þe sonne. And worke þou þan as þou dide before, etc. Or ellis knowe
þou what houre it is þat þou art inne, by þin instrument. Than bringe
þou furthe fro thennes þe labelle and ley it vpon þe degre of þe mone,
and þerby may þou wite also whan it was flode, or whan it wol be next,
be it nyght or day; &c.
