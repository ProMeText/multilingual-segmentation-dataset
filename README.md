# ✂️ Multilingual Segmentation Dataset

> **From manuscripts to models: a multilingual corpus for sentence segmentation in historical prose.**

This dataset gathers carefully segmented excerpts from a wide range of textual genres — including narrative, didactic, legal, theological, and scholarly prose — spanning seven Romance and Latin languages (13th–16th c.).  
Segment boundaries reflect both historical syntax and editorial conventions, making the corpus suitable for training and evaluating sentence segmentation models, as well as for cross-linguistic and diachronic analysis in NLP and digital philology.

## 📖 Overview

This dataset was developed to train a multilingual sentence segmentation model, used as a pre-processing step in the automatic alignment of historical texts with [**Aquilign**](https://github.com/ProMeText/aquilign), a multilingual alignment tool developed by our team.  
Once the BERT-based models are trained and selected, they are integrated into the alignment workflow to segment texts based on learned boundary recognition — a critical step preceding alignment itself.

The segmented excerpts serve as input for Aquilign, enabling multilingual alignment across structurally and editorially diverse texts.  
A first study applying this pipeline — focused on *Lancelot en prose* — was presented in the 2024 article [*Textual Transmission without Borders*](https://2024.computational-humanities-research.org/papers/paper104/), published in the Computational Humanities Research (CHR) conference proceedings.

As the project evolved, the segmentation corpus was gradually expanded alongside the tool. Initially limited to three Romance languages — *Castilian (`es`), French (`fr`), and Italian (`it`)* — it was later enriched with **Portuguese (`pt`)**, **Catalan (`ca`)**, **Latin (`la`)**, and **English (`en`)**, thereby increasing linguistic diversity and strengthening the robustness of cross-linguistic alignment.

The corpus provides training and evaluation material for **sentence-level segmentation** in **historical prose** from the **13th to 16th centuries**.  
Texts were selected for their **genre diversity** and their ability to reflect **editorial**, **orthographic**, and **linguistic variation** across time, geography, and scribal practices.

To support **reproducibility and multilingual evaluation**, the dataset is structured by language.  
Segmented data are stored under `data/segmented/`, with language-specific files organized as follows:
- `data/segmented/pre_split/<lang>/` — complete segmented lines per language  
- `data/segmented/split/monolingual/<lang>/` — train/dev/test JSON and TXT files  
- `data/segmented/split/multilingual/` — multilingual train/dev/test splits

## 🎯 Purpose

This dataset aims to support the training of machine learning models that can detect sentence and segment boundaries in non-standardized historical texts.

Reliable segmentation is essential for:

- downstream NLP tasks such as **parsing**, **translation**, and **alignment**,
- enhancing the **accessibility** and reusability of medieval sources,
- enabling **cross-linguistic comparison** and advancing **philological and historical-linguistic research**.

[**Model Documentation**](docs/segmentation_model.md).


## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

The segmentation pipeline involves the following steps, from raw historical texts to segmented training data.

## 📊 Corpus Size

Below we present the data corresponding to the most recent version of the corpus size.  
Older versions can be consulted in the [release tags](https://github.com/ProMeText/multilingual-segmentation-dataset/releases).
The current version of the corpus includes segmented excerpts in **seven historical languages**, prepared for sentence segmentation tasks.  

Each excerpt is annotated using the pound sign (`£`) to mark **segment boundaries**, typically corresponding to sentences or syntactic units.  
The corpus does **not include part-of-speech tagging or syntactic annotation** — only sentence-level segmentation.


| Language         | Texts | Segmented Tokens | Segments (`£`) | Train/Dev/Test? |
|------------------|-------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Latin** (`la`)       | 557   | 85,888              | 8,366          | ✅              |
