# ✂️ Multilingual Segmentation Dataset

> **From manuscripts to models: a multilingual corpus for sentence segmentation in historical prose.**

This dataset gathers carefully segmented excerpts from a wide range of textual genres — including narrative, didactic, legal, theological, and scholarly prose — spanning seven Romance and Latin languages (13th–16th c.).  
Segment boundaries reflect both historical syntax and editorial conventions, making the corpus suitable for training and evaluating sentence segmentation models, as well as for cross-linguistic and diachronic analysis in NLP and digital philology.



## 📖 Overview

This dataset was developed to train a multilingual sentence segmentation model used as a pre-processing step in the automatic alignment of historical texts with [**Aquilign**](https://github.com/ProMeText/aquilign), a multilingual alignment tool developed by our team.  
Once the BERT-based models are trained and selected, they are integrated into the alignment workflow to segment texts based on learned boundary recognition — a critical step preceding the alignment itself.

The segmented excerpts serve as input for Aquilign, enabling multilingual alignment across structurally and editorially diverse texts. A first study applying this pipeline — focused on *Lancelot en prose* — was presented in the 2024 article [*Textual Transmission without Borders*](https://2024.computational-humanities-research.org/papers/paper104/), published as part of the Computational Humanities Research (CHR) conference proceedings.


As the project evolved, the segmentation corpus was gradually expanded alongside the tool. Initially limited to three Romance languages — *Castilian (`es`), French (`fr`), and Italian (`it`)* — it was later enriched with **Portuguese (`pt`)**, **Catalan (`ca`)**, **Latin (`la`)**, and **English (`en`)**, increasing linguistic diversity and enhancing the robustness of cross-linguistic alignment.

To support reproducibility and multilingual evaluation, the dataset is organized by work: each text is stored in a dedicated folder containing the source (`raw/`) and segmented (`segmented/`) versions.


The corpus provides training and evaluation material for **sentence-level segmentation** in **historical prose** from the **13th to 16th centuries**. Texts were selected for their **genre diversity**, as well as their capacity to reflect **editorial**, **orthographic**, and **linguistic variation** across time, geography, and scribal practices.

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this dataset is to support the training of machine learning models capable of identifying **sentence and segment boundaries** in **non-standardized historical texts**.  
Reliable segmentation is essential for:

- downstream NLP tasks such as **parsing**, **translation**, and **alignment**,
- enhancing the **accessibility** and reusability of medieval sources,
- enabling **cross-linguistic comparison** and advancing **philological and historical-linguistic research**.


## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

The segmentation pipeline involves the following steps, from raw historical texts to segmented training data.

## 🌐 Data Collection Variability Across Languages

The process of text acquisition varied considerably depending on the language.

- For some languages, such as **Middle French**, acquisition was straightforward thanks to well-structured resources like the [**BFM Corpus**](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/bfm/bfm-textes-diffusion/-/tree/main/TXT?ref_type=heads).

- For **Portuguese**, **English**, and **Italian**, we used structured corpora such as the [**CTA**](https://teitok.clul.ul.pt/teitok/cta/index.php?action=home), [**LAEME**](http://amc.ppls.ed.ac.uk/laeme/texts.html), and [**Biblioteca Italiana**](http://www.bibliotecaitaliana.it/percorsi/19). These provided valuable data, though required **more intensive preparation**.

- In contrast, resources like the **OVI** (Italian) and **CICA** (Catalan) offered limited public access, prompting recovery from **critical editions** or **web scraping** when necessary.

This variability demanded a **flexible, language-sensitive approach** to both **sourcing** and **preprocessing**.

## 🌐 Data Collection Variability Across Languages

The process of acquiring texts varied significantly from one language to another, depending on the availability and structure of existing resources.

- For languages such as **French**, acquisition was relatively straightforward thanks to well-organized repositories like the [**BFM Corpus**](https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/bfm/bfm-textes-diffusion/-/tree/main/TXT?ref_type=heads).

- For **Portuguese**, **English**, and **Italian**, we relied on structured corpora such as [**CTA**](https://teitok.clul.ul.pt/teitok/cta/index.php?action=home), [**LAEME**](http://amc.ppls.ed.ac.uk/laeme/texts.html), and the [**Biblioteca Italiana**](http://www.bibliotecaitaliana.it/percorsi/19). While these resources provided valuable data, they required **more intensive preparation** and cleaning.

- In contrast, for languages like **Catalan** and some varieties of **Italian**, resources such as **CICA** and **OVI** had limited public access, which led us to recover texts from **printed critical editions** or, when necessary, through **web scraping**.

This variability called for a **flexible, language-sensitive approach** to both sourcing and preprocessing.

## 🧾 Source Tracking & Metadata

An internal **application form** was created to standardize the collection process. It allowed for the **documentation, organization, and traceability** of every text included in the corpus.
